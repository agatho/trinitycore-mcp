documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LanguageMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LanguageMgr class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures, language tables, or cached translation
    data that may have been loaded. The destructor ensures proper cleanup when the
    LanguageMgr instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It is automatically
    invoked by the C++ runtime and should not be called directly by user code.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LanguageMgr instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LanguageMgr* langMgr = new LanguageMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use langMgr ...\n    delete langMgr; // Destructor called here\n\
      }\n\n// Or with automatic storage:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    LanguageMgr\
      \ langMgr; // Constructor called\n    // ... use langMgr ...\n    // Destructor\
      \ automatically called when langMgr goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The LanguageMgr destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime when an
    object is destroyed. Since this is a destructor, it should not be called directly
    unless you're implementing custom memory management or RAII patterns. The destructor
    ensures that all dynamically allocated resources are properly freed to prevent
    memory leaks.
