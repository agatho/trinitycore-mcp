  class: KitingUtils
  method: IsKitingCompatibleWithGroupRole
  signature: bool KitingUtils::IsKitingCompatibleWithGroupRole(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a player's kiting behavior is compatible with their group role
    in World of Warcraft.
  description: The IsKitingCompatibleWithGroupRole method evaluates whether a given
    player's current kiting capabilities align with the expectations and requirements
    of their assigned group role within a World of Warcraft instance or raid. This
    function considers factors such as the player's class, specialization, gear, and
    current combat behavior to determine if they are suitable for roles that require
    kiting mechanics, such as ranged DPS or tanking. The method is typically used
    by AI systems or bot logic to ensure proper role assignment and team composition.
    It may also be utilized in automated group matching systems or performance evaluation
    tools.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose kiting
      compatibility is being evaluated. This parameter must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player's kiting behavior is compatible with their assigned
    group role, false otherwise. The evaluation considers various combat-related attributes
    including class specialization, weapon type, and movement mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check kiting compatibility
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player object\nbool isCompatible\
      \ = KitingUtils::IsKitingCompatibleWithGroupRole(myBot);\nif (isCompatible)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with kiting-based strategy\n    LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"Player\
      \ {} is compatible with kiting role.\", myBot->GetName());\n}\nelse\n{\n   \
      \ // Consider alternative strategies\n    LOG_INFO(\"ai\", \"Player {} is not\
      \ compatible with kiting role.\", myBot->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks on player attributes such as
    movement speed, attack patterns, and class-specific abilities. It may also consider
    the current environment (e.g., terrain, enemy positioning) to make accurate compatibility
    assessments.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Incorrect usage with invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
