documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached terrain data from the TerrainCache instance.
  description: The Clear method removes all currently stored terrain data from the
    TerrainCache, effectively resetting its internal cache. This operation is typically
    used when terrain data needs to be refreshed or when the cache is no longer valid
    due to map changes, server updates, or other environmental modifications. The
    method performs no parameter validation and has no return value. It is generally
    safe to call this method at any time, though frequent calls may impact performance
    if the cache is frequently repopulated.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TerrainCache* cache = TerrainCache::Instance();

      cache->Clear();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method invalidates all cached terrain data and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections of code. The cache will be automatically repopulated
    when new terrain data is requested, but this may cause temporary delays during
    the refill process.
