documentation:
  brief: Heals the player's pet using the Survival pet's Mend ability.
  description: The MendPet method applies a healing effect to the player's active
    survival pet, restoring a portion of its health. This method is typically invoked
    when the player uses the Mend ability while having a pet summoned. The healing
    amount is determined by the pet's current health and the player's level, with
    a maximum heal that scales accordingly. It ensures that the pet's health does
    not exceed its maximum value after healing. The method performs no action if no
    pet is currently active or if the pet is already at full health.

  notes: This method is part of the Survival pet's ability system and relies on internal
    pet state tracking. It should only be called when a player has an active pet summoned,
    otherwise it will silently do nothing.
