  class: Spell
  method: GetCaster
  signature: WorldObject * Spell::GetCaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the caster object of the spell, which is the source of the spell
    effect.
  description: The GetCaster method retrieves the WorldObject that initiated the spell.
    This is typically the caster who triggered the spell, such as a player or creature.
    The method returns a pointer to the WorldObject, which can be null if the spell
    was not cast by a valid caster or if the caster has been destroyed. This method
    is essential for determining the source of spell effects and is commonly used
    in spell handling logic to identify the origin of spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the WorldObject that initiated the spell. If the spell
    was not cast by a valid caster or if the caster has been destroyed, this may return
    nullptr. The returned object can be a player, creature, or other WorldObject depending
    on how the spell was triggered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "WorldObject* caster = spell->GetCaster();\nif (caster)\n{\n    // Use caster\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell handling code to determine the source
    of spell effects. It's important to note that the returned object may be nullptr
    if the spell was not cast by a valid caster, such as when a spell is triggered
    by an item or other non-WorldObject source.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other spell-related
    methods, as the caster may not always be available depending on how the spell
    was triggered. Also, ensure that the returned pointer is valid before dereferencing
    it to avoid memory access violations.
