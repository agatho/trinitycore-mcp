  class: RuneSystem
  method: ConsumeSpecificRunes
  signature: void RuneSystem::ConsumeSpecificRunes(uint32 blood, uint32 frost, uint32
    unholy)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes specified amounts of blood, frost, and unholy runes for a player
    character.
  description: The ConsumeSpecificRunes method is used to deduct a given number of
    runes from a player's rune pool. This method is typically invoked when a player
    casts a spell or uses an ability that requires specific types of runes. The parameters
    represent the count of each rune type (blood, frost, unholy) to be consumed. It
    directly modifies the internal rune state of the RuneSystem instance, reducing
    the available runes for subsequent abilities. This method does not validate whether
    sufficient runes are available before consumption; it is expected that the caller
    ensures valid rune counts prior to invocation.
  parameters:
  - name: blood
    description: The number of blood runes to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the quantity of blood runes required for the action.
  - name: frost
    description: The number of frost runes to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the quantity of frost runes required for the action.
  - name: unholy
    description: The number of unholy runes to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the quantity of unholy runes required for the action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume One Rune of Each Type
    code: 'RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();

      runesys->ConsumeSpecificRunes(1, 1, 1); // Consumes one blood, one frost, and
      one unholy rune'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume Two Blood Runes for a Powerful Ability
    code: 'RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();

      runesys->ConsumeSpecificRunes(2, 0, 0); // Consumes two blood runes only'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal rune state and should only
    be called after verifying that the player has sufficient runes. The RuneSystem
    class is part of the player's combat mechanics in World of Warcraft, specifically
    for Death Knights who utilize rune-based resource management.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking rune availability may result in negative
    rune counts, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors during gameplay.
    Always ensure that the requested rune consumption is valid before calling this
    function.
