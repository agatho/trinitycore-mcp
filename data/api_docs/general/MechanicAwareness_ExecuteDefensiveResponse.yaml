  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: ExecuteDefensiveResponse
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::ExecuteDefensiveResponse(Player * bot, const
    MechanicInfo & mechanic)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a defensive response based on mechanic awareness for the specified
    player bot.
  description: The ExecuteDefensiveResponse method is responsible for triggering appropriate
    defensive actions when a player bot encounters specific game mechanics or threats.
    This method evaluates the provided MechanicInfo structure to determine the correct
    defensive behavior, such as casting protective spells, moving to safety, or activating
    defensive abilities. It integrates with the bot's AI system to ensure timely and
    contextually appropriate responses to mechanical triggers within the World of
    Warcraft environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the defensive response. Must not be null.
  - name: mechanic
    description: Reference to a MechanicInfo structure containing details about the
      mechanic or threat triggering the defensive action. This includes information
      such as mechanic type, duration, and severity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Defensive Response Execution
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnMechanicTriggered(Player* bot, const MechanicInfo& mechanic)\n\
      {\n    mechanicAwareness.ExecuteDefensiveResponse(bot, mechanic);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Defensive Response Based on Mechanic Type
    code: "void MyBotAI::HandleMechanicAwareness(Player* bot, const MechanicInfo&\
      \ mechanic)\n{\n    if (mechanic.type == MECHANIC_STUN)\n    {\n        mechanicAwareness.ExecuteDefensiveResponse(bot,\
      \ mechanic);\n    }\n    else if (mechanic.type == MECHANIC_ROOT)\n    {\n \
      \       // Handle root-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot's defensive AI system and should be called
    only when a valid mechanic trigger is detected. The method assumes that the bot
    has sufficient resources (mana, health, etc.) to perform the defensive action.
    Implementation details may vary depending on the specific mechanics being handled.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer exceptions. The method does not validate the contents of the MechanicInfo
    structure, so callers should ensure it contains valid data. Improper use may result
    in unexpected behavior or performance issues.
