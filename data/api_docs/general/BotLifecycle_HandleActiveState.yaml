documentation:
  brief: Updates the active state of bots based on elapsed time.
  description: The HandleActiveState method manages the lifecycle and behavior of
    active bots within the TrinityCore environment. It processes bot states, handles
    updates such as AI decision making, movement, and interaction with the game world.
    This method is typically called from a periodic update loop to ensure bots remain
    responsive and behave according to their configured settings. The method uses
    the provided time delta (diff) to determine how much time has passed since last
    execution, which influences bot behavior timing and state transitions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other updates...\n    botLifecycle->HandleActiveState(diff);\n\
      \    // Other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically every tick or at fixed
    intervals, to maintain bot responsiveness. It's designed to handle multiple bots
    efficiently without blocking the main game thread.
