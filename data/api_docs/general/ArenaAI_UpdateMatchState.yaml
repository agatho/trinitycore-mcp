  class: ArenaAI
  method: UpdateMatchState
  signature: void ArenaAI::UpdateMatchState(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of an arena match for a given player.
  description: The UpdateMatchState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the current state of an arena match within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    handles various aspects of match progression, including tracking player readiness,
    managing match start conditions, and coordinating game state transitions. It typically
    operates as part of the AI system for arena battlegrounds, ensuring that all players
    are properly synchronized with the ongoing match status. The method may also handle
    cleanup operations when a match concludes or enters a new phase.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier within the
      arena match context. This parameter likely refers to a player's unique ID or
      index within the match roster, used for tracking individual player states and
      progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena match update
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      ArenaAI* arenaAI = new ArenaAI();

      arenaAI->UpdateMatchState(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating multiple players during match progression
    code: "int playerIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n\
      {\n    arenaAI->UpdateMatchState(&playerIds[i]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked during the main game loop or at specific match
    events such as player entry, readiness changes, or match start. It may interact
    with internal match state tracking systems and could be called from different
    threads depending on how the arena AI system is implemented.
  warnings: Care should be taken when passing player identifiers to this method, as
    incorrect values may lead to undefined behavior or match state corruption. The
    method assumes valid player data and does not perform extensive validation.
