  class: BotResourcePool
  method: PreallocateSessions
  signature: void BotResourcePool::PreallocateSessions(uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Preallocates a specified number of bot sessions in the resource pool for
    efficient memory management and performance optimization.
  description: The PreallocateSessions method initializes and reserves a given number
    of bot sessions within the BotResourcePool. This preallocation ensures that subsequent
    bot creation or activation requests can be fulfilled without additional overhead
    from dynamic memory allocation. The method is typically called during system initialization
    or when anticipating a high demand for bot resources. It allows the system to
    maintain consistent performance by avoiding runtime allocation delays and managing
    memory more predictably. The sessions are prepared but not necessarily active
    until explicitly used by a bot controller.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of bot sessions to preallocate in the resource pool. Must
      be a positive integer representing the desired capacity of the pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Preallocation Usage
    code: 'BotResourcePool* pool = BotResourcePool::Instance();

      pool->PreallocateSessions(100); // Preallocate 100 bot sessions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Preallocation with Dynamic Count
    code: 'uint32 expectedBots = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_MAX_BOTS);

      BotResourcePool::Instance()->PreallocateSessions(expectedBots);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or configuration changes
    to ensure sufficient resources are available. The preallocated sessions remain
    in a ready state and can be quickly assigned to new bot requests without delay.
  warnings: Calling this method after bots have already been created may lead to resource
    waste or inconsistent behavior. It's recommended to call PreallocateSessions early
    in the initialization phase before any bot activity begins.
