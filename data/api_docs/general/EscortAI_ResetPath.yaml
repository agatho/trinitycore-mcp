documentation:
  brief: Resets the escort AI path to its initial state, clearing any active waypoints
    and restoring default behavior.
  description: The ResetPath method in EscortAI is used to reset the current escort
    path to its original configuration. This function clears all active waypoints,
    stops any ongoing movement, and reinitializes the escort AI's state to begin following
    the predefined path from the start. It is typically called when an escort mission
    needs to be restarted or when a character has completed their path and should
    begin again from the beginning. The method ensures that the AI returns to its
    default idle state before resetting the path, making it safe for use during quest
    progression or when re-initiating escort sequences.

  - title: Resetting an Escort Path
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (EscortAI*\
      \ escort = dynamic_cast<EscortAI*>(GetAI()))\n    {\n        escort->ResetPath();\n\
      \        escort->Start(false);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI is in a state where it can
    safely reset its path without causing unexpected behavior. It's recommended to
    ensure that the NPC is not currently engaged in combat or other critical actions
    before calling this function.
