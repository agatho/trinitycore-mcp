documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerbotMigrationMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class is responsible for
    releasing all allocated memory and cleaning up internal data structures used during
    player bot migration processes. This method ensures that any dynamically allocated
    resources, such as migration queues, temporary data buffers, or internal tracking
    structures, are properly deallocated when the manager instance is destroyed. In
    the context of TrinityCore's player bot system, this destructor plays a critical
    role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining system stability during server
    shutdown or manager reinitialization. The method does not accept any parameters
    and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotMigrationMgr
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    // PlayerbotMigrationMgr instance goes out of scope\n\
      \    // Destructor automatically called\n}\n\n// Example usage in a function\n\
      void TestFunction() {\n    PlayerbotMigrationMgr* mgr = new PlayerbotMigrationMgr();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations ...\n    delete mgr; // Triggers destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotMigrationMgr object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other
    threads are actively using the manager instance during destruction to avoid race
    conditions. The method assumes all dependent resources have been properly managed
    elsewhere in the system.
  warnings: Calling the destructor directly on a stack-allocated instance may lead
    to undefined behavior if the object has already been destroyed. Avoid calling
    this destructor manually unless you're certain about the object's lifecycle management.
