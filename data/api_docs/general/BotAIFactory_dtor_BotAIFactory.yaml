documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotAIFactory instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotAIFactory class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures, AI behavior configurations, or references
    to player bots that were managed by this factory instance. Since this is a destructor,
    it is automatically invoked when the BotAIFactory object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. The destruction process ensures proper cleanup of bot AI
    components and prevents memory leaks within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    BotAIFactory factory;\n    // ... use factory\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when factory goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'BotAIFactory* factory = new BotAIFactory();

      // ... use factory ...

      delete factory; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing dynamic
    allocation. It is important to ensure that all bot AI components are properly
    shut down before the factory instance is destroyed to avoid dangling references
    or resource leaks.
  warnings: Avoid calling this destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. Also, ensure no other threads are accessing the
    factory during destruction to prevent race conditions.
