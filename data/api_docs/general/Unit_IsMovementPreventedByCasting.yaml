  class: Unit
  method: IsMovementPreventedByCasting
  signature: bool Unit::IsMovementPreventedByCasting() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether movement is prevented by casting.
  description: This method checks if the unit's current casting state prevents it
    from moving. It returns true when the unit is in a casting state that blocks movement,
    such as when casting spells that require channeling or certain interruptible spells.
    This is commonly used in game mechanics to determine if a unit can move during
    spellcasting, particularly for preventing movement during channeling or interruptible
    spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's current casting state prevents movement, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsMovementPreventedByCasting())\n{\n    // Unit cannot move\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Unit can move\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to determine if a unit can move during spellcasting. It may be called
    frequently during combat, so performance considerations should be taken into account.
  warnings: This method may not accurately reflect all casting states that prevent
    movement. Some specific spell effects or mechanics might require additional checks
    beyond what this method provides.
