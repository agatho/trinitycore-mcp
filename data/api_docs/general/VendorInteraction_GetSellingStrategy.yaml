  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetSellingStrategy
  signature: SellingStrategy VendorInteraction::GetSellingStrategy(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the selling strategy associated with a specific player's GUID in
    the vendor interaction system.
  description: The GetSellingStrategy method fetches the configured selling strategy
    for a given player within the VendorInteraction class. This strategy defines how
    items are priced, sold, or managed by vendors when interacting with the specified
    player. The method likely accesses internal data structures that map player GUIDs
    to their respective selling strategies, which may be dynamically assigned based
    on player reputation, faction, or other game state factors. It is typically used
    during vendor transactions to determine appropriate pricing or item availability
    for individual players.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose selling strategy
      is being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: Returns a SellingStrategy object that defines how items should be sold
    to the specified player. If no specific strategy exists for the player, it may
    return a default strategy or throw an exception depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Selling Strategy for Player
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      SellingStrategy strategy = vendorInteraction.GetSellingStrategy(playerId);

      // Use the retrieved strategy to adjust item pricing or availability

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves lookups in internal maps or databases that store
    player-specific vendor interaction data. Performance may be impacted if many players
    are being queried frequently without caching.
  warnings: Ensure the playerGuid parameter is valid and corresponds to an active
    player; otherwise, behavior is undefined. The returned SellingStrategy object
    should not be modified directly unless explicitly designed for mutation.
