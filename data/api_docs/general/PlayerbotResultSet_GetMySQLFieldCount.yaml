  class: PlayerbotResultSet
  method: GetMySQLFieldCount
  signature: int PlayerbotResultSet::GetMySQLFieldCount(int * mysqlResult)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of fields (columns) in a MySQL result set.
  description: The GetMySQLFieldCount method returns the count of fields (columns)
    present in a MySQL result set that was previously obtained from a database query.
    This method is typically used within the Playerbot system to analyze the structure
    of query results when processing bot AI decisions or data retrieval operations.
    It provides essential metadata about the result set, enabling developers to correctly
    iterate through columns and access field values. The method expects a valid MySQL
    result handle as input, which should have been obtained from a successful database
    query execution.
  parameters:
  - name: mysqlResult
    description: Pointer to a MySQL result set structure (MYSQL_RES*) containing the
      query results. This parameter must point to a valid result object that was returned
      by a previous MySQL query operation.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of fields (columns) in the provided
    MySQL result set. Returns 0 if the input parameter is NULL or if the result set
    contains no fields.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MYSQL_RES* result = mysql_store_result(&mysql_connection);\nint fieldCount\
      \ = playerbotResultSet->GetMySQLFieldCount(result);\nif (fieldCount > 0) {\n\
      \    // Process the result set with known number of fields\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: In Playerbot Context
    code: "PlayerbotAI* ai = bot->GetPlayerbotAI();\nPlayerbotResultSet* resultSet\
      \ = ai->GetPlayerbotResultSet();\nMYSQL_RES* queryResult = ai->GetQueryResult(\"\
      SELECT guid, name, level FROM characters WHERE online = 1\");\nint fieldCount\
      \ = resultSet->GetMySQLFieldCount(queryResult);\nfor (int i = 0; i < fieldCount;\
      \ ++i) {\n    // Access each field in the result\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerbotResultSet class which handles database
    query results for AI decision making. The input parameter must be a valid MYSQL_RES*
    pointer, otherwise behavior is undefined. The returned field count can be used
    to allocate appropriate buffers or validate data structure expectations before
    processing result rows.
  warnings: Passing a NULL pointer to mysqlResult will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crash. Always verify that the MySQL query executed successfully and returned
    a valid result set before calling this method. This method does not perform any
    validation on the input parameter beyond checking for NULL.
