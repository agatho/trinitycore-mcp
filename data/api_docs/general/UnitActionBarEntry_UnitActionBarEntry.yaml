documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new UnitActionBarEntry object with default values for all member
    variables.
  description: The UnitActionBarEntry constructor initializes a new instance of the
    UnitActionBarEntry class. This method sets up the internal state of the action
    bar entry, typically initializing member variables to their default or null states.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class likely represents
    an individual slot in a player's action bar, containing information about the
    spell, item, or ability bound to that slot. The constructor ensures that all data
    members are properly initialized before the object is used in gameplay mechanics
    such as action bar rendering, input handling, or spell casting.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new UnitActionBarEntry instance
    code: 'UnitActionBarEntry entry;

      // The entry is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used in action bar management logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating action bar entries for players. Developers should not need to explicitly
    call this constructor unless implementing custom action bar handling or testing
    code.
