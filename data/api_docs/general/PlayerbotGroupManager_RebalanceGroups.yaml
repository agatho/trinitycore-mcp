documentation:
  brief: Rebalances player groups to optimize team composition and role distribution.
  description: The RebalanceGroups method in PlayerbotGroupManager is responsible
    for redistributing players across existing groups within the bot system to ensure
    optimal team balance. This function analyzes current group compositions, player
    roles, and class distributions to reorganize players into more effective teams.
    It typically runs during group management updates or when significant changes
    occur in player availability or group dynamics. The method ensures that each group
    maintains a balanced mix of tank, healer, and damage dealer roles while considering
    player levels and gear distributions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Rebalancing
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      groupMgr->RebalanceGroups();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the bot system during group
    updates but can also be invoked manually when significant changes to player groups
    occur. It may cause temporary group reorganization and could affect ongoing bot
    activities until rebalancing is complete.
  warnings: Invoking this method during active combat or critical group operations
    may cause unexpected behavior or temporary loss of group coordination. Avoid calling
    it in high-frequency loops or during sensitive gameplay moments.
