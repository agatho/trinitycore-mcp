  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: HandleQuestGiverInteraction
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestGiverInteraction(Player * bot, uint32
    questGiverId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a quest giver interaction for a player bot, handling quest acceptance,
    completion, and related quest flow mechanics.
  description: The HandleQuestGiverInteraction method manages all aspects of a player
    bot's interaction with a quest giver NPC. It determines whether the bot can accept
    or turn in quests, updates quest progress, handles reward distribution, and manages
    quest-related dialogue. This method is typically invoked when a bot interacts
    with an NPC that offers quests, ensuring proper quest state management within
    the dynamic quest system. The method evaluates the bot's current quest status,
    checks prerequisites, and executes appropriate quest actions based on the interaction
    type.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is interacting
      with the quest giver. Must be a valid player instance with proper quest data
      initialized.
  - name: questGiverId
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC entity. This ID corresponds
      to the creature or game object that is offering quests to the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Giver Interaction
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance

      uint32 questGiverGUID = 12345;

      DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestGiverInteraction(myBot, questGiverGUID);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interaction Based on Quest State
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 npcId = 98765;\nif (bot->GetQuestStatus(npcId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestGiverInteraction(bot,\
      \ npcId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's quest data has been properly initialized
    and that the quest giver NPC exists in the world. It may trigger additional internal
    callbacks for quest events such as QUEST_EVENT_ACCEPTED or QUEST_EVENT_COMPLETE.
    The method does not directly handle movement or targeting of the quest giver;
    these should be managed by calling code.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as it will likely cause a crash if passed an invalid reference. Also,
    be aware that this method may modify the bot's quest log and inventory directly,
    so any preconditions or side effects should be considered.
