documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TransportAnimation object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The TransportAnimation destructor is responsible for cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated during the lifetime of a TransportAnimation instance.
    This includes releasing any dynamically allocated data structures, clearing internal
    state, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's transport system, this
    destructor ensures that animation-related resources tied to moving transports
    (such as vehicles or elevators) are properly freed. The method is automatically
    invoked by the C++ runtime when an object is destroyed, and developers should
    not call it directly unless performing explicit cleanup in custom code.

  - title: Automatic destruction of TransportAnimation object
    code: "void exampleFunction()\n{\n    TransportAnimation* anim = new TransportAnimation();\n\
      \    // ... use the animation object ...\n    delete anim; // Destructor called\
      \ here automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of memory management in TrinityCore's transport
    system. It ensures that all resources associated with transport animations are
    properly released, preventing memory leaks. Developers should be aware that calling
    this destructor manually (via delete) is the standard way to trigger cleanup,
    and it should not be invoked directly unless implementing custom memory management.
