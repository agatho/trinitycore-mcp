  signature: void FormationManager::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all formation-related performance metrics and counters to their initial
    state.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated performance data and
    counters within the FormationManager. This includes resetting internal statistics
    such as update frequencies, processing times, and any tracked formation behavior
    metrics. The method is typically invoked during system initialization or when
    a clean slate is required for performance monitoring. It ensures that subsequent
    measurements are not influenced by previous data, making it useful for testing
    scenarios or when restarting formation tracking after significant changes in game
    state.

  examples:
  - title: Reset Formation Metrics at Startup
    code: "void InitializeWorld() {\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n  \
      \  sFormationManager->ResetMetrics();\n    // ... continue with startup procedures\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not interfere with active
    formation processing. It's recommended to call this before starting performance-sensitive
    operations or when switching between different game modes.
  warnings: Calling ResetMetrics during active formation updates may lead to inconsistent
    metric reporting until the next full cycle of data collection.
