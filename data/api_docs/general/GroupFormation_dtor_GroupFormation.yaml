  method: ~GroupFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::~GroupFormation()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupFormation object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~GroupFormation destructor is called automatically when a GroupFormation
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, and references held
    by the GroupFormation instance. In the context of TrinityCore's group management
    system, this destructor may handle cleanup of formation-related state data such
    as member positions, movement patterns, or synchronization flags that were maintained
    during group operations. The destruction process is typically seamless and does
    not require explicit user intervention.

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    GroupFormation formation;\n    // ... use formation\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = new GroupFormation();

      // ... use formation ...

      delete formation; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implemented as a virtual function in the base class, allowing
    proper polymorphic behavior if GroupFormation is used in inheritance hierarchies.
    It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references to the destroyed
    instance after this method completes.
