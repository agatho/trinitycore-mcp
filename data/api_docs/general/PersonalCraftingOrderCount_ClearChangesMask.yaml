  class: PersonalCraftingOrderCount

  signature: void PersonalCraftingOrderCount::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask for a personal crafting order count.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a PersonalCraftingOrderCount object. This typically indicates that any previously
    tracked modifications to the crafting order count have been acknowledged and should
    no longer be considered as pending changes. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this method is often used in synchronization routines where
    client and server states need to be aligned, ensuring that change notifications
    are properly cleared after updates have been processed.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PersonalCraftingOrderCount orderCount;

      orderCount.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core framework during state
    synchronization or when acknowledging changes. It's important to understand that
    clearing the mask does not modify the actual crafting order count value itself,
    only the tracking of its changes.
