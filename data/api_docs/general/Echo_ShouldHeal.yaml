  class: Echo
  method: ShouldHeal
  signature: bool Echo::ShouldHeal() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Echo AI should initiate a healing action based on
    current health and target conditions.
  description: The ShouldHeal method evaluates the Echo AI's current state to decide
    if it is appropriate to perform a healing action. This decision is typically based
    on factors such as the Echo's own health percentage, the health status of its
    target, and any configured healing thresholds or conditions. The method serves
    as a core part of the AI's decision-making process within the TrinityCore framework,
    ensuring that healing actions are only performed when beneficial according to
    predefined logic. It does not directly perform healing but rather returns a boolean
    value indicating whether healing should occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Echo AI determines that a healing action should be
    initiated; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (echo->ShouldHeal()) {\n    echo->DoHeal();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with health-based conditions
    code: "if (echo->ShouldHeal() && echo->GetHealthPct() < 50) {\n    echo->CastSpell(SPELL_HEALING_TOUCH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when the Echo
    AI evaluates its current target's health status. The exact conditions used to
    determine whether healing should occur may be configurable via database entries
    or script parameters in a real-world TrinityCore implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Echo AI instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing uninitialized members could lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, avoid calling this method outside of an AI update context unless you are
    certain about its internal state dependencies.
