  class: QuestCompletion
  method: AbandonUncompletableQuest
  signature: void QuestCompletion::AbandonUncompletableQuest(Player * bot, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Abandons a quest that cannot be completed by the specified player.
  description: The QuestCompletion::AbandonUncompletableQuest method removes a quest
    from a player's quest log if the quest is not completable. This typically occurs
    when a quest's requirements can no longer be met due to changes in game state,
    such as NPC deaths, item removal, or other conditions that make progression impossible.
    The method ensures that the player does not remain stuck with an unfinishable
    quest, allowing them to continue their progress in the game. It is usually invoked
    during automated quest management or when a bot detects an invalid quest state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      will be abandoned.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be abandoned. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::AbandonUncompletableQuest(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a quest is confirmed to be uncompletable.
    It modifies the player's quest log directly and does not trigger any quest abandonment
    events or notifications unless handled separately by the calling code.
  warnings: Calling this method on a quest that is still completable may result in
    unintended behavior, such as loss of progress or quest data inconsistency. Ensure
    proper validation before invoking this function.
