  signature: int TempSummon::GetTimer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds until the temporary summon expires
  description: The GetTimer method retrieves the current timer value for a temporary
    summon, indicating how much time remains before the summon is automatically removed
    from the game world. This timer is typically set when the summon is created and
    decrements over time. The returned value represents the milliseconds remaining
    until expiration. For summons with infinite duration, this method may return a
    very large number or zero depending on implementation details. This functionality
    is crucial for managing temporary creatures like summoned pets, guards, or other
    transient game entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the time in milliseconds remaining before the temporary
    summon expires. Returns 0 if the summon has already expired or if the timer is
    not active. Negative values may indicate special states or errors depending on
    the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check summon expiration time
    code: "void CheckSummonExpiry(TempSummon* summon)\n{\n    int timeLeft = summon->GetTimer();\n\
      \    if (timeLeft <= 0)\n    {\n        // Summon has expired\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Summon has expired!\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Summon expires in %d milliseconds\", timeLeft);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement summon timer-based behavior
    code: "void HandleSummonTick(TempSummon* summon)\n{\n    int timeLeft = summon->GetTimer();\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger special behavior when 10 seconds remain\n    if (timeLeft\
      \ <= 10000 && timeLeft > 9000)\n    {\n        summon->CastSpell(summon, SPELL_SUMMON_WARNING,\
      \ true);\n    }\n    \n    // Remove summon when timer expires\n    if (timeLeft\
      \ <= 0)\n    {\n        summon->UnSummon();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The timer value returned by GetTimer is updated regularly by the game's update
    loop. This method should not be used for precise timing calculations but rather
    for general time-based behavior. The actual implementation may vary depending
    on whether the summon has a fixed duration or is set to expire based on other
    conditions.
  warnings: Be aware that calling GetTimer on a non-temporary summon (e.g., a regular
    creature) may return unexpected values. Always verify that the object is indeed
    a TempSummon before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
