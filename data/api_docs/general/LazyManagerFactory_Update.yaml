  class: LazyManagerFactory
  method: Update
  signature: void LazyManagerFactory::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all lazy managers in the factory with the specified time difference.
  description: The Update method processes and advances the state of all registered
    lazy managers within the LazyManagerFactory. It is typically called from the game
    loop to ensure that lazy-loaded resources or managers are updated according to
    the elapsed game time. This method handles internal timing logic and ensures that
    managers perform their periodic tasks, such as resource cleanup, data refresh,
    or delayed operations. The diff parameter represents the time elapsed since the
    last update in milliseconds, which is used for accurate timing of manager operations.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: LazyManagerFactory::Instance()->Update(diff);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to maintain
    proper manager state. It is designed to be efficient and non-blocking, ensuring
    that updates do not cause frame rate drops.
