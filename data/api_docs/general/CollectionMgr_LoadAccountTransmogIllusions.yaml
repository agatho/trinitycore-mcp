documentation:
  brief: Loads account transmog illusions for the player's collection.
  description: The LoadAccountTransmogIllusions method initializes and loads the set
    of transmog illusions known to the player's account. This method is typically
    invoked during the player login process or when the collection manager needs to
    refresh the available transmog data. It ensures that all previously acquired illusion
    data is correctly loaded into memory for use in the game's transmogrification
    system. The method operates on the account level, meaning that any illusions obtained
    by characters on the same account will be shared across all characters.

  - title: Basic Usage During Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    sCollectionMgr->LoadAccountTransmogIllusions(knownTransmogIllusions);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the CollectionMgr class and should
    not be invoked directly by external systems unless specifically required. The
    method assumes that the account data has already been loaded and is accessible.
