  brief: Returns the name of the trigger object
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name associated with
    a Trigger object. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    triggers are typically used for quest events, area triggers, or game event activations.
    This method provides access to the trigger's identifying name which is often used
    for logging, debugging, or in-game interaction purposes. The returned string is
    a const reference, meaning it should not be modified and is valid for the lifetime
    of the Trigger object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the trigger's name. This
    string is guaranteed to be valid and non-empty for properly initialized trigger
    objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Trigger* trigger = sObjectMgr->GetTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n  \
      \  std::string name = trigger->GetName();\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server.loading\"\
      , \"Found trigger: %s\", name.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Event Handling
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) override\n{\n  \
      \  // Iterate through triggers related to this quest\n    for (auto& trigger\
      \ : sObjectMgr->GetTriggersForQuest(quest->GetQuestId()))\n    {\n        TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      entities.trigger\", \"Processing trigger: %s\", trigger->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \        // Trigger logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference remains valid only as long as the Trigger object
    exists. This method is typically used for debugging and logging purposes rather
    than for modifying trigger behavior. The name field is usually set during trigger
    creation or loading from database.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned string reference as it's const. Be aware that
    if the trigger object has not been properly initialized, the name might be empty
    or undefined. Always check for null pointers before calling this method on potentially
    uninitialized triggers.
