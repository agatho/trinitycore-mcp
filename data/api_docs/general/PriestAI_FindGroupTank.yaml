api:
  class: PriestAI
  method: FindGroupTank
  signature: int * PriestAI::FindGroupTank()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the group tank, or NULL if no valid tank is found.
  description: 'The FindGroupTank method searches through the current player''s group
    members to identify and return the GUID of the designated tank. This is typically
    used by PriestAI to determine which group member should be targeted for protective
    spells like Power Word: Shield or Prayer of Mending. The method prioritizes players
    who are actively tanking, checking for specific roles or status flags that indicate
    a player is fulfilling the tank role within the group. If no suitable tank is
    found, it returns NULL, indicating that no valid tank exists in the current group
    context.'
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an int representing the GUID of the group tank, or NULL if
    no tank is found. The returned value can be used directly with TrinityCore's GUID-based
    lookup functions to retrieve the actual GameObject or Unit object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Priest AI Logic
    code: "void PriestAI::DoHeal()\n{\n    int* tankGuid = FindGroupTank();\n    if\
      \ (tankGuid != NULL)\n    {\n        // Apply healing to the tank\n        Unit*\
      \ tank = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me, *tankGuid);\n        if (tank && tank->IsInWorld())\n\
      \            DoCast(tank, SPELL_POWER_WORD_SHIELD);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to a valid group context and that
    group members are properly initialized with role information. It may not function
    correctly outside of a group environment or if group data is stale.
  warnings: The returned pointer should never be dereferenced directly without checking
    for NULL. Also, the GUID might become invalid if the tank leaves the group or
    dies, so it's recommended to validate the target before using it in actions.
