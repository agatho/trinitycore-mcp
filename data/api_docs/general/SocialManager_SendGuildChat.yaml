documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to all guild members in the player's guild
  description: The SendGuildChat method broadcasts a chat message to every member
    currently online in the player's guild. This method handles the logic for sending
    guild chat messages, including validation of the message content and ensuring
    the player is properly affiliated with a guild. The message is transmitted through
    the social system and appears in the guild chat channel for all recipients. This
    functionality is part of TrinityCore's social networking system that enables communication
    between players within their guild context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the message was successfully queued for transmission to
    guild members, or false if the player is not in a guild or the message failed
    validation
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Chat Message
    code: "if (player->GetSocial()->SendGuildChat(\"Welcome to our guild!\") == true)\n\
      {\n    // Message sent successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Guild chat message\
      \ sent.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current guild membership and online status.
    Messages are only sent to players who are currently logged in and part of the
    same guild. The implementation may include rate limiting or message length restrictions
    for spam prevention.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if the player belongs to a guild
    will likely result in no action being taken. Additionally, very long messages
    might be truncated or rejected by the server's chat system.
