documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SocialManager instance and cleans up associated social list
    data.
  description: The ~SocialManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources associated with the SocialManager class. This includes removing
    all entries from the player's friend list, ignore list, and any other social data
    structures that may have been allocated during the object's lifetime. The destructor
    ensures no memory leaks occur when a SocialManager instance is destroyed, typically
    as part of a player's session cleanup or when the server shuts down. It performs
    necessary cleanup operations to maintain data integrity and prevent dangling references
    in the social subsystem.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during object lifetime
    code: "void CleanupPlayerSocialData(Player* player)\n{\n    // SocialManager is\
      \ automatically destroyed when player object goes out of scope\n    // or when\
      \ the player session ends\n    // No explicit call needed to destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a SocialManager
    instance is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The cleanup process ensures that
    all social data is properly removed from memory and any associated database entries
    are handled appropriately.
