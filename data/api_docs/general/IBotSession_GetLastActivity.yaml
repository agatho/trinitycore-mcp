  method: GetLastActivity
  signature: uint64 IBotSession::GetLastActivity() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the timestamp of the last activity recorded for this bot session.
  description: The GetLastActivity method retrieves the Unix timestamp representing
    the last known activity time for the bot session. This value is typically updated
    whenever the bot performs an action, such as moving, interacting with objects,
    or engaging in combat. The returned value can be used to determine how long a
    bot has been inactive, which is useful for implementing idle detection, session
    timeouts, or automated bot management systems. The method does not modify any
    internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the Unix timestamp (in seconds) of the last
    recorded activity for this bot session. If no activity has been recorded yet,
    it will return 0 or the initial creation time of the session.
  examples:
  - title: Check if bot has been active recently
    code: "uint64 lastActivity = session->GetLastActivity();\nuint64 currentTime =\
      \ time(nullptr);\nif ((currentTime - lastActivity) > 300) // 5 minutes\n{\n\
      \    // Bot has been inactive for more than 5 minutes\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\"\
      , \"Bot has been idle for {} seconds\", currentTime - lastActivity);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without synchronization
    concerns. The timestamp is updated on every significant bot action, making it
    reliable for tracking session activity.
