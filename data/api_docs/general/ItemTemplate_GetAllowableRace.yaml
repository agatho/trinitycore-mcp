documentation:
  brief: Returns the allowable race mask for the item template.
  description: The GetAllowableRace method retrieves the bitmask representing which
    races are allowed to equip or use this item. In World of Warcraft, items can have
    restrictions based on player race, and this method returns the combined race flags
    that determine eligibility. The returned value is a bitfield where each bit corresponds
    to a specific race, allowing for multiple races to be permitted simultaneously.
    This method is commonly used during item validation and character creation checks
    to ensure players can only use items appropriate to their race.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the allowable race bitmask. Each bit in the integer
    corresponds to a specific race in the game, with set bits indicating that the
    associated race is allowed to use this item. A value of 0 typically means no restrictions
    or all races are allowed.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Alliance races can use an item
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate->GetAllowableRace()\
      \ & RACE_MASK_ALLIANCE)\n{\n    // This item is usable by Alliance races\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate player race against item restrictions
    code: "Player* player = session->GetPlayer();\nItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(67890);\n\
      uint32 allowableRaceMask = itemTemplate->GetAllowableRace();\nif (allowableRaceMask\
      \ != 0 && !(allowableRaceMask & (1 << player->getRace())))\n{\n    // Player's\
      \ race is not allowed to use this item\n    SendItemNotAllowedException(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a raw bitmask value. Developers should be aware that race
    flags are typically defined as bit positions (e.g., RACE_HUMAN = 1, RACE_ORC =
    2, etc.), so bitwise operations are required to check specific races. The returned
    value may be 0 if no race restrictions are set on the item.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without proper validation of the item
    template. If an invalid item ID is used, the method might return unexpected results
    or cause undefined behavior. Always ensure that the ItemTemplate pointer is valid
    before calling this method.
