  method: GetActions
  signature: int Strategy::GetActions() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of actions associated with the AI strategy.
  description: The GetActions method returns an integer representing the count of
    actions currently defined within the AI strategy. This method is typically used
    in the context of TrinityCore's AI system to determine how many executable actions
    are available for a given strategy, which can be useful for debugging, performance
    monitoring, or dynamic strategy adjustment. The returned value reflects the internal
    state of the strategy and may change if actions are added or removed during runtime.
    This method does not modify any state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of actions defined in the AI strategy.
    A return value of zero indicates that no actions are currently configured for
    this strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = ...;

      int actionCount = myStrategy->GetActions();

      printf("Number of actions: %d\n", actionCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation on the internal action list
    and should have minimal performance impact. It is intended to be called frequently
    during AI evaluation cycles, so it's optimized for speed.
