  class: UnitAura
  method: _ApplyForTarget
  signature: void UnitAura::_ApplyForTarget(Unit * target, Unit * caster, AuraApplication
    * aurApp)
documentation:
  brief: Applies an aura to a target unit with specified caster and application context.
  description: The _ApplyForTarget method is responsible for applying a specific aura
    to a target unit within the TrinityCore framework. It takes into account the caster
    of the aura, the target unit being affected, and the application context which
    includes details about how the aura should be applied (e.g., whether it's a passive
    or active application). This method ensures that all necessary game mechanics
    are handled when an aura is applied to a unit, including updating the unit's aura
    state, triggering relevant events, and managing any visual or functional effects
    associated with the aura. The method typically operates as part of the broader
    aura management system in World of Warcraft-style games.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the aura application.
      Must be a valid unit instance, typically a player or creature.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting or applying the aura.
      Can be null if the aura has no caster (e.g., passive auras).
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object containing details about how
      the aura should be applied, including application type, duration, and other
      relevant parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Application
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      Unit* caster = player;

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      unitAura->_ApplyForTarget(target, caster, app);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying a Spell Aura to a Target
    code: "if (target && caster)\n{\n    AuraApplication* auraApp = new AuraApplication();\n\
      \    auraApp->SetAuraType(AURA_TYPE_SPELL);\n    unitAura->_ApplyForTarget(target,\
      \ caster, auraApp);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the aura system and should
    not be invoked directly in most cases. It's important to ensure that the target
    and caster units are valid before calling this method. The AuraApplication object
    must be properly initialized with all necessary parameters before being passed
    to this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the AuraApplication
    parameter may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that both target and
    caster pointers are valid and that the aura application context is correctly set
    up.
