  class: PathfindingManager
  method: SetCacheDuration
  signature: void PathfindingManager::SetCacheDuration(uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cache duration for pathfinding calculations in milliseconds.
  description: The SetCacheDuration method configures how long cached pathfinding
    results are considered valid before they expire. This is crucial for balancing
    performance and accuracy in World of Warcraft's AI pathfinding system. The cache
    duration directly impacts how frequently new paths are calculated versus how often
    stale data is used, affecting both server performance and NPC movement quality.
    Setting this value too low may cause excessive path recalculations, while setting
    it too high might result in outdated paths being used for extended periods.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMs
    description: The cache duration in milliseconds. This determines how long pathfinding
      results are cached before being invalidated and recalculated. Valid values are
      typically in the range of 100 to 30000 milliseconds (100ms to 30 seconds).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      manager->SetCacheDuration(5000); // Set cache to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Example
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      // For high-traffic areas with many moving units

      manager->SetCacheDuration(1000); // Shorter cache for more responsive paths

      // For static environments with fewer moving units

      manager->SetCacheDuration(10000); // Longer cache to reduce computation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all pathfinding operations managed by the PathfindingManager
    instance. The cache duration setting should be tuned based on server load and
    the specific requirements of NPC movement patterns. Changes take effect immediately
    for subsequent pathfinding requests.
  warnings: Setting the cache duration to very low values (less than 100ms) may cause
    performance degradation due to excessive path recalculations. Setting it too high
    (over 60 seconds) might lead to noticeable pathfinding inaccuracies in dynamic
    environments where terrain or obstacles frequently change.
