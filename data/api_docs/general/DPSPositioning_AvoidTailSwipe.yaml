api:
  class: DPSPositioning
  method: AvoidTailSwipe
  signature: void DPSPositioning::AvoidTailSwipe(Player * dps, Unit * target, float
    swipeAngle)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player to avoid a tail swipe attack from a target unit.
  description: The AvoidTailSwipe method calculates an optimal escape position for
    a player to avoid being hit by a tail swipe attack from a target unit. It determines
    a safe direction away from the target based on the specified swipe angle and moves
    the player to that position. This method is typically used in AI behavior for
    managing player positioning during combat encounters, particularly against bosses
    with tail swipe mechanics. The method modifies the player's position directly
    without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object that needs to avoid the tail swipe attack.
      Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object (typically a boss) that is performing
      the tail swipe attack. Must be a valid unit instance.
  - name: swipeAngle
    description: The angular width of the tail swipe attack in degrees. Used to calculate
      the safe zone for positioning. Should be a positive value representing the full
      arc of the swipe.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "void BossEncounter::OnTailSwipe(Player* player, Unit* boss, float swipeAngle)\n\
      {\n    DPSPositioning positioning;\n    positioning.AvoidTailSwipe(player, boss,\
      \ swipeAngle);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic swipe angle
    code: "void CombatManager::HandleTailSwipe(Player* player, Unit* boss)\n{\n  \
      \  float swipeAngle = boss->GetMechanicDuration(MECHANIC_TAIL_SWIPE);\n    DPSPositioning\
      \ positioning;\n    positioning.AvoidTailSwipe(player, boss, swipeAngle);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates player position and should be used carefully
    in AI systems. It assumes the target unit is within range and that the player
    has sufficient movement capabilities to reach the calculated safe position. The
    positioning calculation may not account for terrain or obstacles between the player
    and the safe zone.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation of player and target pointers
    can lead to crashes. Ensure the target unit is actively attacking with a tail
    swipe before calling this method. The method does not check if the calculated
    position is valid or reachable, which could result in unexpected behavior if the
    player cannot move to that location.
