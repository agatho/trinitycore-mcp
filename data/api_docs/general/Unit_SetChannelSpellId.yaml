  signature: void Unit::SetChannelSpellId(uint32 channelSpellId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell ID of the channel being cast by the unit.
  description: This method assigns a specific spell ID to the channel being cast by
    the Unit, allowing for proper tracking and management of channeling spells. It
    is commonly used in conjunction with other channel-related methods to control
    spell mechanics during channeling operations. The method directly affects the
    unit's channel state and can be used to set or update the spell being channeled.
  parameters:
  - name: channelSpellId
    description: The spell ID that represents the channeling spell being set. This
      value determines which spell is currently being channeled by the unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetChannelSpellId(12345);

      // Sets channel spell ID to 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with channeling
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetChannelSpellId(54321);

      // Sets channel spell ID to 54321

      // This would typically be used in combination with other channel methods'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is actively channeling a
    spell. It directly modifies the internal channel state of the Unit and may affect
    the behavior of related methods such as GetChannelSpellId or SetChannelTarget.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect channeling behavior,
    potentially causing the unit to channel the wrong spell or fail to properly update
    its channel state. This method should not be used in situations where the unit
    is not actively channeling a spell.
