  class: ObjectTypeIdCheck
  method: ObjectTypeIdCheck
  signature: void ObjectTypeIdCheck::ObjectTypeIdCheck(int typeId, bool equals)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ObjectTypeIdCheck with a specified object type ID and comparison
    mode.
  description: The ObjectTypeIdCheck constructor initializes a checker object that
    can be used to determine if an object's type ID matches a specified value. This
    class is typically used in TrinityCore's object filtering systems, particularly
    when iterating through world objects or applying conditions based on object types.
    The 'typeId' parameter specifies the target object type ID to check against, while
    the 'equals' parameter determines whether to perform an equality check (true)
    or inequality check (false). This functionality is essential for efficient object
    filtering in game systems such as AI behavior, quest tracking, and interaction
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: typeId
    description: The object type ID to compare against. Valid values are integer identifiers
      representing different object types in TrinityCore (e.g., TYPEID_PLAYER, TYPEID_UNIT,
      TYPEID_GAMEOBJECT).
  - name: equals
    description: Boolean flag determining comparison logic. If true, checks for equality
      (object type ID matches typeId). If false, checks for inequality (object type
      ID does not match typeId).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize ObjectTypeIdCheck for Players
    code: 'ObjectTypeIdCheck playerChecker(TYPEID_PLAYER, true);

      // This will match all objects that are players'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize ObjectTypeIdCheck for Non-Units
    code: 'ObjectTypeIdCheck nonUnitChecker(TYPEID_UNIT, false);

      // This will match all objects that are NOT units (e.g., players, gameobjects,
      items)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is designed to be used with TrinityCore's ObjectGuid and WorldObject
    systems. The 'typeId' parameter should correspond to valid type identifiers defined
    in the TrinityCore codebase. The constructor performs no validation of the input
    parameters, so invalid type IDs may lead to unexpected behavior during object
    filtering operations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this class with dynamic object types or custom
    extensions to the core system. Ensure that all type IDs used are valid and properly
    defined within the TrinityCore framework to avoid runtime errors or incorrect
    filtering results.
