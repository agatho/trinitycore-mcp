  brief: Retrieves the locale-specific objectives data for a quest entry
  description: The GetQuestObjectivesLocale method retrieves a pointer to an array
    of integers that represent locale-specific objective data for a given quest entry.
    This data typically contains information about how quest objectives should be
    displayed or interpreted based on the player's locale settings. The returned pointer
    points to an internal static array managed by the ObjectMgr class, and the caller
    must not modify or free the memory. The method is used primarily for localization
    purposes within the TrinityCore framework to ensure that quest objectives are
    properly translated and formatted according to regional settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing locale-specific quest
    objectives data, or nullptr if no data exists for the requested entry. The array
    contains integer values that define how objectives should be displayed in different
    locales.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and process quest objective locale data
    code: "const int* objectives = sObjectMgr->GetQuestObjectivesLocale(12345);\n\
      if (objectives != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the locale-specific objectives\
      \ data\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) // Assuming max 4 objectives\n    {\n\
      \        if (objectives[i] != 0)\n        {\n            printf(\"Objective\
      \ %d: %d\\n\", i, objectives[i]);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a pointer to internal static data managed by ObjectMgr.
    The returned array should never be modified or freed by the caller. The method
    is thread-safe as it only accesses read-only data structures. Performance is optimal
    since no dynamic allocation occurs, but the method may return nullptr if no locale-specific
    data exists for the requested quest entry.
  warnings: Never attempt to free or modify the returned pointer as it points to internal
    static memory. Be cautious when using this method without checking for null returns,
    as missing locale data will result in a null pointer being returned. The array
    size and structure should be known by the caller to avoid buffer overruns.
