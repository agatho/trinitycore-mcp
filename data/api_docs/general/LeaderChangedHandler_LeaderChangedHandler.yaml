documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a group leader changes in the bot's party
  description: The LeaderChangedHandler method is invoked when the group leader of
    a bot's party is updated. This handler manages the necessary logic to respond
    to leadership changes, such as updating internal state, reassigning roles, or
    triggering appropriate AI behaviors. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment,
    this typically occurs when a player leaves a group, is kicked, or is promoted/demoted
    from leader status. The method ensures that the bot's AI adapts correctly to maintain
    group cohesion and follow the new leader's commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnLeaderChanged()\n{\n    LeaderChangedHandler handler;\n\
      \    handler.LeaderChangedHandler(this);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    group leadership changes are detected. Developers should ensure that any custom
    logic within this handler does not introduce race conditions or performance bottlenecks,
    especially in high-frequency group scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you're implementing a custom AI
    behavior or debugging group leadership transitions. Improper handling of leader
    changes may cause bots to lose synchronization with the group or execute incorrect
    actions.
