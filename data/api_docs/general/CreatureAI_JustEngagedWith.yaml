  signature: void CreatureAI::JustEngagedWith(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when the creature enters combat with a target
  description: The JustEngagedWith method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a CreatureAI object's associated creature transitions into combat mode and
    engages with a target. This method serves as a hook for custom AI behavior during
    the initial engagement phase, allowing developers to implement specific actions
    such as casting spells, playing animations, or triggering events upon entering
    combat. The method is typically called once per combat encounter and occurs after
    the creature has successfully engaged its target but before any combat logic begins.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or combat
      state. This parameter may be null if no valid target exists at the time of engagement.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(int*\
      \ param0) override {\n        // Cast a spell on engagement\n        if (param0\
      \ && *param0 > 0) {\n            DoCast(SPELL_ENGAGEMENT_SPELL);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Engagement with Target Validation
    code: "class AdvancedCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(int*\
      \ param0) override {\n        if (!param0 || *param0 <= 0) {\n            return;\
      \ // No valid target\n        }\n        \n        Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(*param0));\n        if (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n            // Perform actions specific to the engaged target\n       \
      \     DoCast(target, SPELL_INITIAL_SPELL);\n            Talk(SAY_ENGAGED);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI lifecycle and is called only once per
    combat entry. It's important to note that param0 may be null or invalid, so proper
    validation should always occur before dereferencing. The method is executed within
    the context of the creature's AI thread and should not block for extended periods.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations in this method
    as it can impact combat responsiveness. Also, ensure that any spell casting or
    actions performed here do not cause infinite loops or unintended behavior during
    combat transitions.
