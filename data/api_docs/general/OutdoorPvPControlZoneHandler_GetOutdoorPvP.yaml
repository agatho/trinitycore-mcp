  method: GetOutdoorPvP
  signature: OutdoorPvP * OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler::GetOutdoorPvP() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the OutdoorPvP object associated with this control zone handler.
  description: The GetOutdoorPvP method returns a pointer to the OutdoorPvP instance
    that manages the PvP zone controlled by this handler. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to access the specific OutdoorPvP implementation
    responsible for handling player interactions, capture events, and zone-specific
    PvP mechanics in areas such as Wintergrasp or other outdoor battlegrounds. The
    returned pointer should be validated before use, as it may be null if no OutdoorPvP
    instance is currently assigned to this control zone handler.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the OutdoorPvP object associated with this control zone handler,
    or nullptr if no such object exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = controlZoneHandler->GetOutdoorPvP();\nif (pvp != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the OutdoorPvP instance\n    pvp->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid PvP Instance
    code: "OutdoorPvPControlZoneHandler* handler = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetHandler(4197);\
      \ // Wintergrasp\nif (handler)\n{\n    OutdoorPvP* pvp = handler->GetOutdoorPvP();\n\
      \    if (pvp)\n    {\n        // Perform PvP-related operations\n        pvp->HandlePlayerEnterZone(player,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in event handling and zone management within
    the OutdoorPvP system. The returned OutdoorPvP object may be shared among multiple
    control zone handlers or may be unique to a specific zone, depending on the implementation.
    Ensure proper synchronization if accessing from different threads.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before dereferencing the pointer.
    Accessing an invalid OutdoorPvP instance can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called during the destruction phase of the handler or
    the OutdoorPvP object itself.
