  signature: void Spell::SendCastResult(SpellCastResult result, int32 * param1, int32
    * param2) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a spell cast result message to the player's client, indicating whether
    the spell was successfully cast or if there was an error.
  description: The SendCastResult method is used to communicate spell cast results
    back to the player's client in World of Warcraft. It handles both successful casts
    and various failure conditions such as insufficient mana, range, or other requirements.
    This method is typically called during spell execution to provide feedback to
    the player about the outcome of their spell casting attempt. The method takes
    a SpellCastResult enum value and optional parameters that can provide additional
    details about the specific failure or success condition.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The SpellCastResult enum value indicating whether the spell was successfully
      cast or what type of failure occurred. Valid values include SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS,
      SPELL_CAST_FAILED, SPELL_CAST_NO_POWER, SPELL_CAST_RANGE, etc.
  - name: param1
    description: Optional parameter that can provide additional information about
      the cast result, such as specific resource requirements or range details. Can
      be nullptr if no additional information is needed.
  - name: param2
    description: Optional parameter that can provide additional information about
      the cast result, such as specific resource requirements or range details. Can
      be nullptr if no additional information is needed.
  returns: null

      spell->SendCastResult(SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell cast result with parameters
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SendCastResult(SPELL_CAST_FAILED, &manaCost, &range);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell processing to provide immediate
    feedback to the player. It's important to note that this method does not actually
    execute the spell itself - it only sends the result message back to the client.
    The method should be called after determining the cast result but before completing
    the spell execution.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the spell has already
    been executed or completed, as it may cause confusion or incorrect behavior. Also,
    ensure that param1 and param2 are properly initialized to avoid memory access
    violations.
