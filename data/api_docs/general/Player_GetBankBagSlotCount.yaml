  signature: uint8 Player::GetBankBagSlotCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bank bag slots available to the player.
  description: This method retrieves the count of bank bag slots that the player currently
    has access to. In World of Warcraft, players can store items in their bank bags,
    which are separate from their character's regular bags. The bank bag slot count
    determines how many additional bag slots can be purchased and used for storing
    items in the bank. This value is typically affected by the player's level, available
    gold, and any purchased bank slot upgrades. The method returns a uint8 value representing
    the number of bank bag slots that are currently available.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the number of bank bag slots available
    to the player. This value typically ranges from 0 to 8, depending on the player's
    level and purchased upgrades.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 bankSlots = player->GetBankBagSlotCount();\nif (bankSlots > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Player has bank bag slots available\n    // Proceed with bank operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other bank-related methods
    to determine the player's bank capacity. It may be affected by game mechanics
    such as level requirements and gold costs for purchasing additional bank slots.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine the total number of bag slots
    available, as it only returns the count of bank bag slots. The actual bank slot
    count may vary based on player's level and purchased upgrades.
