documentation:
  brief: Loads and returns terrain information for a specified map ID
  description: The LoadTerrainImpl method is responsible for loading terrain data
    for a given map ID. It retrieves or creates a TerrainInfo object that contains
    all relevant terrain data for the specified map, including height maps, liquid
    data, and other geographical information necessary for world rendering and collision
    detection. This method typically acts as an internal implementation detail of
    the TerrainMgr class and is used to ensure that terrain data is properly initialized
    before being accessed by other systems such as pathfinding or client rendering.
    The method may cache loaded terrain data to improve performance on subsequent
    requests for the same map ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A shared pointer to a TerrainInfo object containing the terrain data for
    the specified map. Returns nullptr if the map ID is invalid or if terrain data
    cannot be loaded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LoadTerrainImpl
    code: "uint32 mapId = 0; // Eastern Kingdoms\nstd::shared_ptr<TerrainInfo> terrain\
      \ = sTerrainMgr->LoadTerrainImpl(mapId);\nif (terrain)\n{\n    // Terrain data\
      \ successfully loaded\n    // Use terrain information for further processing\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TerrainMgr class and should
    not be invoked directly by other systems unless specifically required. The returned
    TerrainInfo object may be shared across multiple callers, so modifications to
    the data should be handled carefully to avoid race conditions. Performance considerations
    include caching mechanisms that prevent repeated loading of the same map data.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid map IDs as it may result in undefined
    behavior or null pointer exceptions. The method assumes that all necessary map
    files are available on the server filesystem and will fail silently if they are
    missing or corrupted.
