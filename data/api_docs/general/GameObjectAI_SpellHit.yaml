documentation:
  brief: Handles spell hit events for game objects, allowing custom AI behavior when
    a spell affects the object.
  description: The SpellHit method is a virtual callback function in the GameObjectAI
    class that is invoked whenever a spell successfully hits the game object. This
    method allows developers to implement custom logic in response to spell effects,
    such as triggering special animations, modifying object state, or initiating other
    AI behaviors. It serves as an event handler for spell interactions and can be
    overridden by custom GameObjectAI implementations to provide unique responses
    to different spells. The method is typically called during the spell's execution
    phase when the spell's effects are applied to the target object.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that was hit by the spell. This represents
      the game object that received the spell effect, which could be a GameObject,
      Creature, Player, or other world entity.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell that hit the object. This includes spell ID, effects, duration,
      and other spell properties that can be used to customize behavior based on the
      specific spell being cast.
  returns: null

      \ }\n    }\n};"

  notes: The SpellHit method is part of the GameObject's AI system and will only be
    called if the GameObject has a custom AI implementation. It's important to check
    that both parameters are valid before using them, as null pointers could occur
    in edge cases. This method should not be used for heavy computations or blocking
    operations as it may affect spell execution performance.
  warnings: Do not modify the spellInfo structure directly as it is read-only. Be
    cautious when calling methods that might cause recursion or infinite loops within
    SpellHit. Avoid performing database operations or complex calculations in this
    method to prevent potential performance issues.
