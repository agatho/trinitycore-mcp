  class: UnholyPetTracker
  method: UnholyPetTracker
  signature: void UnholyPetTracker::UnholyPetTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the UnholyPetTracker class for managing unholy
    pet behavior and tracking.
  description: The UnholyPetTracker constructor initializes the tracking system for
    unholy pets, setting up internal data structures and state management required
    for monitoring pet behavior in the context of the Unholy Death Knight specialization.
    This method prepares the object to handle pet-related events, such as summoning,
    dismissing, and managing the pet's combat actions within the TrinityCore framework.
    The initialization process ensures that all necessary hooks and callbacks are
    registered to properly track pet status changes and synchronize with the player's
    death knight abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new UnholyPetTracker instance
    code: 'UnholyPetTracker* tracker = new UnholyPetTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to monitor unholy pet behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a death knight's pet management system. It does not perform any active tracking
    until explicitly started through other methods. The object assumes that the owning
    player is a death knight with the Unholy specialization.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you are implementing or extending
    the core pet tracking functionality. Improper initialization may lead to undefined
    behavior when attempting to track pet events.
