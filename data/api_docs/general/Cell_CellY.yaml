documentation:
  brief: Returns the Y coordinate of the cell within the game world grid
  description: The CellY method retrieves the vertical coordinate (Y-axis) of a cell
    in the TrinityCore world grid system. This value represents the cell's position
    along the Y-axis, which is used for spatial indexing and efficient object management
    within the game world. The returned value corresponds to the cell's grid position
    rather than a specific world coordinate, making it useful for determining relative
    positioning of objects within the game world. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with CellX to uniquely identify a cell in the world grid.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the Y coordinate of the cell in the world grid
    system. This value indicates the vertical position of the cell within the overall
    grid structure, where positive values generally represent positions northward
    from the origin point.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Cell* cell = new Cell(x, y);

      int cellY = cell->CellY();

      printf("Cell Y coordinate: %d\n", cellY);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Grid Position Calculation
    code: 'Cell* playerCell = GetPlayer()->GetCurrentCell();

      int yCoord = playerCell->CellY();

      int xCoord = playerCell->CellX();

      printf("Player is in cell (%d, %d)\n", xCoord, yCoord);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the grid-based coordinate rather than world coordinates.
    The cell grid system uses a fixed-size grid where each cell represents a specific
    area of the game world. Cell coordinates are typically used for efficient spatial
    queries and object culling in the TrinityCore engine.
