  method: GenerateZigzagWaypoints
  signature: int KitingManager::GenerateZigzagWaypoints(const int & start, const int
    & direction, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a sequence of zigzag waypoints for kiting movement patterns.
  description: The GenerateZigzagWaypoints method calculates and returns a series
    of waypoints that form a zigzag pattern, typically used in kiting behavior for
    NPC or player movement. This method is designed to assist in creating dynamic
    movement paths that avoid direct linear trajectories, which can be useful for
    tactical positioning or evasive maneuvers in combat scenarios. The generated waypoints
    are intended to be consumed by the movement system to guide entities along a path
    that alternates direction at regular intervals. The method takes into account
    starting position, initial direction, and total distance to determine the waypoint
    sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting index or identifier of the waypoint in the sequence.
      This value determines where the zigzag path begins.
  - name: direction
    description: The initial direction of movement, typically represented as an integer
      angle or axis index (e.g., 0 for X-axis, 1 for Y-axis). Controls the orientation
      of the first segment of the zigzag.
  - name: distance
    description: The total distance in world units that the zigzag path should cover.
      Determines how many waypoints are generated and their spacing.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of waypoints successfully generated.
    A negative value may indicate an error or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zigzag Path Generation
    code: int numWaypoints = kitingManager.GenerateZigzagWaypoints(0, 1, 50.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Zigzag Paths
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    int waypoints = kitingManager.GenerateZigzagWaypoints(i\
      \ * 10, i % 2, 30.0f);\n    // Process generated waypoints\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger kiting AI system and may depend on
    internal state or configuration settings such as movement speed, turn radius,
    or waypoint spacing thresholds. It assumes that the calling code will handle the
    actual application of these waypoints to entity movement.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values for 'start' or 'direction' might lead to unexpected
    waypoint generation or invalid paths. Ensure that the distance is non-negative
    and reasonable for the intended use case.
