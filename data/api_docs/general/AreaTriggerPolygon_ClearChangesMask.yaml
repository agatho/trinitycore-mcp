documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger polygon, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    AreaTriggerPolygon object. This operation is typically used to indicate that all
    previously detected modifications or updates to the polygon's state have been
    processed and should no longer be considered as pending. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, area trigger polygons are used to define spatial
    regions for various game mechanics such as quest triggers, spell effects, or environmental
    interactions. Clearing the changes mask ensures that subsequent checks for modified
    state will not report previously handled changes.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTriggerPolygon* polygon = ...;

      polygon->ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after processing area trigger events or when
    synchronizing the polygon's state with clients. It's important to understand that
    clearing the mask does not modify the polygon's geometric properties, only its
    internal tracking of changes.
