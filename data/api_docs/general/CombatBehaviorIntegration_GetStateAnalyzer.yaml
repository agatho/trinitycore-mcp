  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetStateAnalyzer
  signature: CombatStateAnalyzer * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetStateAnalyzer()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat state analyzer instance used for tracking and evaluating
    combat-related conditions.
  description: The GetStateAnalyzer method returns a pointer to the CombatStateAnalyzer
    object associated with this CombatBehaviorIntegration instance. This analyzer
    is responsible for monitoring various combat states such as player engagement,
    target status, threat levels, and other relevant combat metrics. The returned
    pointer should be used carefully as it may be null if the combat behavior integration
    has not been properly initialized or configured. The method provides access to
    real-time combat data that can be used by AI decision-making systems to determine
    appropriate actions during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the CombatStateAnalyzer instance, or nullptr if the analyzer
    has not been initialized or is unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer* analyzer = combatBehavior->GetStateAnalyzer();\nif\
      \ (analyzer != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the analyzer to check combat state\n\
      \    bool isInCombat = analyzer->IsInCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void UpdateAI()\n{\n    CombatStateAnalyzer* analyzer = combatBehavior->GetStateAnalyzer();\n\
      \    if (analyzer != nullptr && analyzer->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        // Execute\
      \ combat-specific AI logic\n        if (analyzer->GetThreatLevel() > 0.8f)\n\
      \        {\n            // High threat - use defensive abilities\n         \
      \   UseDefensiveAbility();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The CombatStateAnalyzer returned by this method is managed internally by
    the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. Developers should not attempt to delete or
    destroy the returned pointer. The analyzer instance may be shared across multiple
    components, so modifications to its state can affect other systems that rely on
    the same analyzer.
  warnings: Never assume the returned pointer is valid without checking for null.
    If the combat behavior integration has not been properly initialized, this method
    will return nullptr, which could lead to segmentation faults if not handled correctly.
    Always validate the return value before using the analyzer.
