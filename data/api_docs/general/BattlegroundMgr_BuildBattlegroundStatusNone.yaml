  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: BuildBattlegroundStatusNone
  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::BuildBattlegroundStatusNone(WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlefieldStatusNone
    * battlefieldStatus, const Player * player, uint32 ticketId, uint32 joinTime)
documentation:
  brief: Fills a BattlefieldStatusNone packet with data for a player's battleground
    status when they are not in a battleground.
  description: The BuildBattlegroundStatusNone method constructs and populates a BattlefieldStatusNone
    packet that is sent to a player's client when they are not currently participating
    in a battleground. This packet typically contains information about the player's
    current battleground queue status, ticket ID, and join time, allowing the client
    to display appropriate UI elements such as queue timers or status messages. The
    method is part of the battleground management system and ensures that players
    receive consistent status updates even when they are not actively engaged in combat.
    It is commonly called during queue transitions or when a player's battleground
    state changes from active to idle.
  parameters:
  - name: battlefieldStatus
    description: Pointer to a BattlefieldStatusNone packet object that will be filled
      with the player's battleground status information.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the battleground status is
      being built. Used to access player-specific data such as queue state and ticket
      information.
  - name: ticketId
    description: Unique identifier for the battleground queue ticket associated with
      this player. Used to track the player's position in the queue.
  - name: joinTime
    description: Timestamp indicating when the player joined the battleground queue,
      used to calculate time remaining or queue position.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground queue handling
    code: 'WorldPackets::Battleground::BattlefieldStatusNone status;

      uint32 ticketId = player->GetBattlegroundQueueId();

      uint32 joinTime = player->GetBattlegroundJoinTime();

      BattlegroundMgr::Instance()->BuildBattlegroundStatusNone(&status, player, ticketId,
      joinTime);

      player->SendDirectMessage(status);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the battleground manager when a player's
    state transitions to an inactive queue status. The packet structure may vary depending
    on the client version and specific battleground type. Developers should ensure
    that the player object passed in is valid and has a proper battleground queue
    entry before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer or invalid ticketId can
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player is properly queued
    for a battleground before invoking this method.
