  class: RenewTracker
  method: HasRenew
  signature: bool RenewTracker::HasRenew(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has an active Renew spell effect.
  description: The HasRenew method determines whether a specific player, identified
    by their GUID, currently has an active Renew spell effect applied to them. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage spell tracking
    and aura states for healing spells. The check is performed against the internal
    tracking system maintained by the RenewTracker class, which monitors active Renew
    effects on players. This functionality is crucial for game mechanics involving
    spell stacking, duration management, and ensuring proper spell behavior in combat
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for active Renew
      effect. Must be a valid player GUID from the WorldObject system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has an active Renew spell effect;
    otherwise returns false. The method performs a lookup in the internal tracking
    structure and does not directly query the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for active Renew
    code: "if (renewTracker->HasRenew(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has active Renew\
      \ effect\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You already have Renew active.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Apply new Renew effect\n    ApplyRenewSpell(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in spell casting validation
    code: "void SpellHandler::HandleRenewCast(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    if\
      \ (target && renewTracker->HasRenew(target->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n   \
      \     // Prevent stacking of Renew\n        SendSpellFailed(caster, SPELL_FAILED_SPELL_UNAVAILABLE);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with casting new Renew\n    CastRenewSpell(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a fast lookup operation using the player's GUID as a
    key. It assumes that the RenewTracker maintains an internal data structure (likely
    a map or set) for tracking active effects. The implementation should be thread-safe
    if used in concurrent environments, though this depends on the specific implementation
    details of the tracker class.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid and refers to a player object;
    passing invalid or non-player GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    return values. This method only checks for active effects and does not validate
    spell casting conditions or other pre-requisites.
