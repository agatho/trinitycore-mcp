  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: DetectStaticObstacles
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::DetectStaticObstacles(const DetectionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and processes static obstacles within the current detection context
    for pathfinding and movement avoidance.
  description: The DetectStaticObstacles method analyzes the provided DetectionContext
    to identify static environmental obstacles such as walls, furniture, or terrain
    features that could impede movement. It performs spatial queries against the game
    world's collision system to determine which obstacles are present in the specified
    area. The method returns a count of detected obstacles or an error code if detection
    fails. This functionality is crucial for AI pathfinding systems and character
    movement logic to avoid collisions with immovable objects in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of static obstacles successfully
    detected and processed. A negative value typically indicates an error during obstacle
    detection, while zero means no obstacles were found within the detection context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle detection usage
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager obstacleManager;\nDetectionContext context;\n\
      // Populate context with relevant data\nint obstacleCount = obstacleManager.DetectStaticObstacles(context);\n\
      if (obstacleCount >= 0)\n{\n    // Process detected obstacles\n    printf(\"\
      Detected %d static obstacles\\n\", obstacleCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ error condition\n    printf(\"Failed to detect obstacles: error code %d\\\
      n\", obstacleCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying collision detection system and may have
    performance implications when called frequently. It is recommended to cache results
    or limit calls to this method during high-frequency pathfinding updates. The method
    assumes that the DetectionContext has been properly initialized with valid spatial
    data.
  warnings: Calling this method without a properly configured DetectionContext may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect obstacle detection. Ensure that all
    required context parameters are set before invoking this method. Performance degradation
    can occur if this method is called excessively in tight loops.
