  class: IVMapManager
  method: getDirFileName
  signature: std::string IVMapManager::getDirFileName(unsigned int pMapId, int x,
    int y) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a directory file name for a specified map and grid coordinates.
  description: The getDirFileName method constructs and returns a string representing
    the directory path for a given map ID and grid coordinates. This is used internally
    by the VMap (Virtual Map) system to organize and locate virtual map data files.
    The method takes into account the map identifier and grid position (x, y) to produce
    a standardized file path structure that allows efficient retrieval of map-related
    data. It's primarily utilized in the context of TrinityCore's terrain and collision
    detection systems where virtual maps are stored and accessed.
  parameters:
  - name: pMapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which to generate the directory
      file name. This corresponds to the Map.dbc entry ID.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the grid position. Typically represents a grid
      cell in the world map coordinate system.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the grid position. Typically represents a grid
      cell in the world map coordinate system.
  returns: A std::string containing the directory file name for the specified map
    and grid coordinates. The format typically follows a pattern like 'mapId/x/y'
    to organize virtual map data files.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'IVMapManager* vmapManager = VMAPMgr::createVMapManager();

      std::string dirName = vmapManager->getDirFileName(0, 64, 64); // Returns something
      like "0/64/64"

      std::cout << "Directory path: " << dirName << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal VMap management system and is not typically
    called directly by game logic. The generated paths are used to locate map data
    files within the virtual map directory structure. It's important to note that
    this method does not validate whether the returned path actually exists on disk;
    it only constructs the expected file path.
