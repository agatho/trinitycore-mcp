  brief: Upgrades the garrison to the next available level.
  description: The Garrison::Upgrade method is responsible for advancing the player's
    garrison to its next upgrade level. This method typically handles the internal
    logic required to progress the garrison's infrastructure, such as increasing building
    capacity or unlocking new features. It may also manage resource costs and validate
    prerequisites before allowing the upgrade to proceed. The method is generally
    invoked when a player has sufficient resources and meets the conditions necessary
    for upgrading their garrison.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();

      garrison->Upgrade();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the garrison's internal state and may trigger
    updates to the player's UI or game data. It should only be called when the garrison
    is eligible for an upgrade based on current resources and level requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that all prerequisites are met before calling this method, as calling
    it without proper conditions may result in undefined behavior or failed upgrades.
