documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is in a disallowed mount form.
  description: This method determines whether the unit is currently in a mount form
    that is explicitly forbidden by game rules or player restrictions. It evaluates
    the unit's current state to identify if they are in a disallowed mount form, which
    could include forms like being in a flight or other restricted states. The method
    returns true if the unit is in such a disallowed form, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently in a disallowed mount form, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsInDisallowedMountForm()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other state checking methods
    to determine if a unit can perform certain actions or if they are restricted from
    specific activities. Implementation relies on internal state tracking and may
    be affected by game mechanics.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may not always reflect
    the actual current state of the unit, especially in complex scenarios involving
    multiple states or conditions.
