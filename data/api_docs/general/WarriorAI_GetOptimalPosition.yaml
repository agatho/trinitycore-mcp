  class: WarriorAI

  signature: int WarriorAI::GetOptimalPosition(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning strategy for a warrior AI
    unit relative to its target.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best positional approach
    for a WarriorAI unit when engaging with a specified target. This method evaluates
    various combat-related factors such as distance, threat level, and target mobility
    to compute an optimal position that maximizes the warrior's effectiveness in melee
    combat. The returned value represents a strategic positioning code that can be
    used by the AI to adjust its movement or attack pattern. The method assumes that
    the WarriorAI has already established a valid target through other means, such
    as the SetTarget() function, and does not perform any validation of the target's
    existence or validity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the optimal positioning strategy for the
    warrior AI. Possible return values may include constants like POSITION_FRONT,
    POSITION_FLANK, or POSITION_BEHIND, though exact values depend on internal implementation
    details. A negative value typically indicates an error condition or invalid target
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI logic
    code: "void WarriorCombatStrategy::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n \
      \   {\n        int optimalPosition = warriorAI->GetOptimalPosition(me->GetVictim());\n\
      \        switch (optimalPosition)\n        {\n            case POSITION_FRONT:\n\
      \                // Move to front of target\n                break;\n      \
      \      case POSITION_FLANK:\n                // Move to flank for better attack\
      \ angle\n                break;\n            default:\n                // Handle\
      \ error or fallback behavior\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of AI decision-making during
    combat scenarios. It may internally utilize pathfinding algorithms and threat
    calculations to determine positioning. The method should only be called when a
    valid target exists, as it relies on target properties such as distance and movement
    state. Performance-wise, this method typically executes quickly but may involve
    some computational overhead depending on the complexity of the AI's positioning
    logic.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target can result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect positioning decisions. The returned integer codes are not guaranteed
    to be stable across different TrinityCore versions and should not be hardcoded.
    Additionally, this method does not perform any movement actions itself; it only
    provides a strategic recommendation that must be acted upon by the calling code.
