documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a group is disbanded in the game world
  description: The OnGroupDisbanded method is invoked when a player's group is disbanded,
    either manually by the group leader or automatically due to all members leaving.
    This method is responsible for cleaning up any resources associated with the group
    and notifying relevant systems about the group's dissolution. The method receives
    a pointer to the Group object that has been disbanded and performs necessary cleanup
    operations such as removing group references from player objects, updating group
    status flags, and triggering any registered callbacks or events related to group
    disbanding. This is an essential part of maintaining game state consistency when
    groups are terminated.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that has been disbanded. This parameter
      must not be null and represents the group instance being destroyed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Module
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::OnGroupDisbanded(Group* group)\n{\n    if (!group)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Log the disbanding event\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Group %u disbanded\", group->GetId());\n    \n    // Perform cleanup operations\n\
      \    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator itr = group->GetMembersBegin();\
      \ itr != group->GetMembersEnd(); ++itr)\n    {\n        Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \        if (player)\n            player->RemoveGroupInvite();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the core group management system during
    group destruction. Developers should ensure that any custom cleanup logic does
    not cause deadlocks or access invalid memory after the group object has been partially
    destroyed. The method assumes that the Group pointer passed to it is valid and
    not already freed.
  warnings: Do not attempt to access group members or perform operations on the group
    object after this method completes, as the group may be in the process of being
    deleted. Avoid calling methods that might re-entrant into the group system from
    within this handler.
