  class: WorldSession
  method: RegisterTimeSync
  signature: void WorldSession::RegisterTimeSync(uint32 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a time synchronization request with the server for the current
    session.
  description: The RegisterTimeSync method is used to initiate a time synchronization
    process between the client and the server. This mechanism helps maintain accurate
    timekeeping across the game world, which is essential for various gameplay mechanics
    such as spell durations, event timing, and player actions that depend on precise
    temporal measurements. The method accepts a counter parameter that typically represents
    the sequence number or identifier of the time sync request being sent. When invoked,
    this method likely queues or sends a time sync packet to the server, allowing
    it to adjust the client's local time reference based on server time.
  parameters:
  - name: counter
    description: A unique identifier or sequence number for the time synchronization
      request. This value is typically incremented with each time sync attempt and
      helps the server track and correlate time sync responses.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Time Sync Registration
    code: 'uint32 syncCounter = 1;

      worldSession->RegisterTimeSync(syncCounter);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Incrementing Counter for Multiple Sync Requests
    code: 'static uint32 syncCounter = 0;

      syncCounter++;

      worldSession->RegisterTimeSync(syncCounter);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the client-side game engine
    when time synchronization is needed. It's important to note that frequent calls
    to this method may impact network performance if not managed properly. The counter
    value should be unique per request to ensure proper tracking by the server.
  warnings: Calling this method with duplicate or non-incrementing counter values
    may cause the server to ignore or misinterpret time sync requests, potentially
    leading to desynchronization issues in gameplay mechanics that rely on accurate
    timing.
