  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetStrategyProfile
  signature: BGStrategyProfile BattlegroundAI::GetStrategyProfile(uint32 playerGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground strategy profile associated with a specific player
    GUID.
  description: The GetStrategyProfile method retrieves the BGStrategyProfile object
    that defines the strategic behavior and AI decisions for a given player within
    a battleground. This method is used by the battleground AI system to determine
    how individual players should behave during gameplay, including their tactical
    choices, movement patterns, and engagement priorities. The returned profile typically
    contains information about the player's role, preferred tactics, and decision-making
    parameters that influence their actions during combat. This method is essential
    for implementing dynamic and adaptive AI behavior in battleground scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BGStrategyProfile object containing the strategic configuration for the
    specified player. The profile includes tactical settings, behavior rules, and
    decision-making parameters that guide the AI's actions during battleground encounters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve strategy profile for a player
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      BGStrategyProfile profile = bgAI->GetStrategyProfile(playerGuid);

      // Use profile to determine AI behavior for this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground initialization or when
    a player's AI behavior needs to be dynamically adjusted. The BGStrategyProfile
    returned may vary based on the player's class, role, or current battleground state.
    Implementation likely involves internal lookup tables or maps that associate player
    GUIDs with their respective strategy profiles.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an active player in
    the battleground; invalid or non-existent GUIDs may result in undefined behavior
    or default profile retrieval. This method should not be called during critical
    sections where AI decisions are being processed to avoid potential race conditions.
