  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: SetPrimaryResource
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::SetPrimaryResource(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the primary resource type for the combat specialization.
  description: The SetPrimaryResource method configures the primary resource type
    associated with a combat specialization. This determines which resource (such
    as mana, rage, energy, or focus) is considered the main resource for the specialization's
    abilities and mechanics. The method updates internal state to reflect the new
    resource type, affecting how resource costs and regeneration are handled for abilities
    tied to this specialization. This is typically used during specialization initialization
    or when switching between different combat specializations.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value specifying the primary resource type
      to set. Valid values include ResourceType::MANA, ResourceType::RAGE, ResourceType::ENERGY,
      and ResourceType::FOCUS.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Primary Resource to Mana
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = new CombatSpecializationBase();

      spec->SetPrimaryResource(ResourceType::MANA);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Specialization with Energy Resource
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* rogueSpec = new CombatSpecializationBase();

      rogueSpec->SetPrimaryResource(ResourceType::ENERGY);

      // This would configure the rogue specialization to use energy as primary resource'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal specialization state and should only
    be called during initialization or when explicitly switching specializations.
    The change affects how abilities consume and regenerate resources, so it must
    be synchronized with the player's current specialization state.
  warnings: Calling this method after a combat specialization has been initialized
    and used may cause inconsistent behavior in resource management for abilities.
    Ensure that all related systems are properly updated when changing the primary
    resource type.
