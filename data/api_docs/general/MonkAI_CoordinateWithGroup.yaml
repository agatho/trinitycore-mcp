documentation:
  brief: Coordinates the monk's actions with the group, ensuring proper synergy and
    positioning during combat.
  description: The CoordinateWithGroup method manages the MonkAI's behavior in relation
    to the player's group members. This method ensures that the monk's abilities,
    positioning, and healing priorities align with the group's current needs and strategy.
    It typically evaluates the health status of nearby group members, identifies optimal
    positioning for damage mitigation or support, and adjusts the AI's decision-making
    process accordingly. The method may also handle coordination with other group
    members to avoid overlapping abilities or to maintain proper raid positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in combat scenario
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        // Other combat logic...\n        CoordinateWithGroup();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may involve
    complex group evaluation logic. It's designed to be efficient and not block the
    main thread for extended periods.
  warnings: The method assumes that the monk has access to valid group information.
    Calling this method outside of a combat or group context may result in unexpected
    behavior or performance issues.
