  brief: Updates the configuration settings for bot accounts within the TrinityCore
    system.
  description: The UpdateConfiguration method refreshes and applies any modified settings
    related to bot accounts in the TrinityCore server. This includes reloading account-specific
    parameters, adjusting behavior flags, and synchronizing changes with active bot
    instances. The method ensures that all bot-related configurations are consistent
    across the game environment and reflects any modifications made to the configuration
    files or runtime settings. It typically runs during server initialization or when
    configuration changes are detected.

    code: BotAccountMgr::UpdateConfiguration();

  notes: This method should be called after any configuration file updates or when
    runtime settings are modified to ensure that bot accounts reflect the latest parameters.
    It may involve reloading data from database tables or config files, so performance
    impact is minimal but noticeable during high-traffic periods.
