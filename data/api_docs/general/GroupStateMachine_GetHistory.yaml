  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: GetHistory
  signature: int GroupStateMachine::GetHistory(uint32 maxEntries) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the history of group state transitions up to a specified maximum
    number of entries.
  description: The GetHistory method returns the count of recent state transitions
    that have occurred within the GroupStateMachine. This method is typically used
    for debugging or monitoring purposes to track how a group's state has evolved
    over time. The returned value indicates the number of entries successfully retrieved
    from the internal history buffer, which may be less than the requested maxEntries
    if the buffer contains fewer items. The actual history data is not returned by
    this method; it only provides the count of available entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: The number of state transition entries retrieved from the history buffer.
    Returns zero if no history exists or if maxEntries is zero. May return a value
    less than maxEntries if the internal history buffer contains fewer entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check History Size
    code: "GroupStateMachine* groupSM = ...;\nint historyCount = groupSM->GetHistory(10);\n\
      if (historyCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process or log the number of history entries\n\
      \    printf(\"Group has %d state transitions in history\\n\", historyCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the internal state of the GroupStateMachine.
    It is a read-only operation that accesses an internal history buffer. The maximum
    number of entries stored in the history buffer may be limited by implementation-specific
    constraints, and this limit is not exposed through the API.
