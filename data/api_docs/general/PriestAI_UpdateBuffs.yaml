documentation:
  brief: Updates the priest's buffs and aura management logic.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating the
    buff states of a priest AI character. It evaluates the current state of the priest's
    auras, determines which buffs should be applied or removed, and ensures that the
    priest maintains optimal magical enhancements based on combat conditions and spell
    availability. This method typically runs during each AI update cycle to keep the
    priest's buff configuration up-to-date with the evolving battlefield situation.

    code: "void PriestAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI framework during each
    update cycle. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom AI behavior that requires explicit buff management.
