  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: ShouldIgnoreObstacle
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ShouldIgnoreObstacle(const ObstacleInfo
    & obstacle, const DetectionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific obstacle should be ignored during pathfinding
    calculations.
  description: The ShouldIgnoreObstacle method evaluates whether a given obstacle,
    as defined by its ObstacleInfo structure and the current DetectionContext, should
    be excluded from avoidance calculations. This is used in AI pathfinding to determine
    if certain environmental elements or objects should not influence movement decisions.
    The method considers factors such as obstacle type, distance, relevance to the
    current context, and any configured ignore rules. It is typically called during
    obstacle avoidance processing within the ObstacleAvoidanceManager to filter out
    irrelevant or non-blocking obstacles.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: A reference to an ObstacleInfo structure containing details about
      the obstacle being evaluated, including its position, size, type, and other
      relevant properties.
  - name: context
    description: A reference to a DetectionContext structure that provides contextual
      information about the current detection scenario, such as the entity's state,
      movement direction, and priority settings.
  returns: Returns true if the obstacle should be ignored during pathfinding; false
    otherwise. An ignored obstacle will not affect the AI's movement decisions or
    path calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (!obstacleAvoidanceManager.ShouldIgnoreObstacle(obstacleInfo, detectionContext))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with normal avoidance logic\n    pathfinder.AddObstacle(obstacleInfo);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering obstacles before processing
    code: "std::vector<ObstacleInfo> filteredObstacles;\nfor (const auto& obstacle\
      \ : allObstacles) {\n    if (!obstacleAvoidanceManager.ShouldIgnoreObstacle(obstacle,\
      \ context)) {\n        filteredObstacles.push_back(obstacle);\n    }\n}\n//\
      \ Use filteredObstacles for pathfinding\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during AI updates, so performance is
    important. The implementation should avoid expensive operations or heavy computations
    to maintain smooth gameplay. It's recommended that the ObstacleInfo and DetectionContext
    structures are lightweight and pre-computed where possible.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the context in
    which it's used. Incorrectly ignoring obstacles can lead to AI getting stuck or
    moving through invalid terrain. Ensure that the obstacle and context data passed
    are valid and up-to-date.
