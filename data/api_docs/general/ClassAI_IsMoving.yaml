  signature: bool ClassAI::IsMoving() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the AI-controlled unit is currently in motion.
  description: The IsMoving method determines whether the AI-controlled unit (such
    as a creature or NPC) is currently executing a movement action. This includes
    walking, running, flying, or any other form of locomotion. The method returns
    true if the unit's movement state indicates active motion, and false if the unit
    is stationary. This functionality is commonly used in AI scripts to make decisions
    based on whether an entity is moving, such as triggering specific behaviors when
    a unit starts or stops moving, or adjusting combat strategies depending on movement
    status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI-controlled unit is currently moving; otherwise returns
    false if the unit is stationary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Check
    code: "if (ai->IsMoving())\n{\n    // Unit is currently moving\n    // Perform\
      \ movement-based actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on Movement
    code: "if (!ai->IsMoving() && !player->IsInCombat())\n{\n    // Only move if not\
      \ already moving and not in combat\n    ai->MoveTo(player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY(),\
      \ player->GetPositionZ());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal movement state tracking of the AI system.
    It may not reflect real-time changes immediately due to potential update delays
    in the AI subsystem. The implementation is typically optimized for performance
    and should not be called excessively in tight loops.
