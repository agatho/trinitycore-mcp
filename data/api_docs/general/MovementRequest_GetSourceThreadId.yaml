  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetSourceThreadId
  signature: uint32 MovementRequest::GetSourceThreadId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the thread identifier of the source that initiated the movement
    request.
  description: The GetSourceThreadId method returns the unique thread identifier associated
    with the source that created or submitted the movement request. This identifier
    is typically used for tracking and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore server's
    multi-threaded environment. The method provides insight into which thread context
    originated the movement request, aiding in performance analysis and ensuring proper
    synchronization between different subsystems handling movement data. It is commonly
    used in scenarios where thread affinity or resource management is required for
    movement-related operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the thread identifier of the source
    that initiated the movement request. This value corresponds to the OS-level thread
    ID and can be used to correlate movement requests with specific server threads
    for debugging or performance monitoring purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      uint32 sourceThread = request.GetSourceThreadId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Movement request originated from thread ID: %u", sourceThread);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Thread Affinity
    code: "void HandleMovementRequest(MovementRequest& req)\n{\n    uint32 threadId\
      \ = req.GetSourceThreadId();\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"movement\", \"Processing movement\
      \ request from thread: %u\", threadId);\n    // Additional processing logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debugging scenarios to trace the origin
    of movement requests. The returned thread ID corresponds to the native OS thread
    identifier, which may differ from TrinityCore's internal thread identifiers. This
    method should be called from within a thread context that has access to the MovementRequest
    object.
  warnings: Be aware that the thread ID returned by this method represents the thread
    at the time of request creation, not necessarily the current execution thread.
    In multi-threaded environments, movement requests may be processed on different
    threads than where they were originally created.
