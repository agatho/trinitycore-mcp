  description: The LearnTalent method allows a player to learn a specific talent from
    the talent tree. This method handles the validation and processing of talent learning,
    including checking if the talent is already learned, verifying prerequisites,
    and updating the player's talent points. It returns a TalentLearnResult indicating
    success or failure of the learning process.

    Possible values include: TALENT_LEARN_SUCCESS (0), TALENT_LEARN_FAILED (1), TALENT_LEARN_ALREADY
    learned (2), TALENT_LEARN_NOT enough points (3), TALENT_LEARN_INVALID (4).'

      if (result == TALENT_LEARN_SUCCESS)\n{\n    // Talent successfully learned\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally checks the player's talent points and validates prerequisites.
    It also handles cooldowns for spells associated with the talent. This method is
    typically used in conjunction with other talent-related methods like GetTalentPoints
    or SetTalentPoints.
  warnings: This method does not handle any UI updates or visual feedback to the player.
    The player must be notified of successful talent learning through other means,
    such as sending a message to the client.
