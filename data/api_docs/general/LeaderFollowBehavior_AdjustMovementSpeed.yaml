api:
  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: AdjustMovementSpeed
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::AdjustMovementSpeed(Player * bot, float distanceToTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the movement speed of a bot player based on its distance to the target
    leader in a follow behavior.
  description: 'The AdjustMovementSpeed method dynamically modifies the speed at which
    a bot player moves while following a leader. It evaluates the distance between
    the bot and the target leader, and adjusts the bot''s movement speed accordingly
    to maintain an appropriate following distance. This method is typically used within
    the LeaderFollowBehavior AI system to ensure smooth and realistic group movement
    mechanics in World of Warcraft. The adjustment considers factors such as the bot''s
    current speed, the distance to the leader, and predefined thresholds for slow,
    normal, and fast movement states. Precondition: The bot player must be valid and
    actively following a leader. Postcondition: The bot''s movement speed is updated
    to reflect its proximity to the target.'
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will have
      its movement speed adjusted. Must not be null.
  - name: distanceToTarget
    description: Float value representing the current distance between the bot and
      the target leader. Used to determine appropriate speed adjustment.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior update
    code: "void LeaderFollowBehavior::Update(Player* bot)\n{\n    float distance =\
      \ bot->GetDistance(leader);\n    AdjustMovementSpeed(bot, distance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with speed thresholds
    code: "void LeaderFollowBehavior::AdjustMovementSpeed(Player* bot, float distanceToTarget)\n\
      {\n    if (distanceToTarget > 30.0f)\n        bot->SetWalk(false);\n    else\
      \ if (distanceToTarget > 10.0f)\n        bot->SetWalk(true);\n    else\n   \
      \     bot->SetWalk(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI movement system and should be called frequently
    during behavior updates to ensure smooth following. The implementation likely
    uses internal thresholds and speed multipliers based on distance ranges. Performance
    considerations include avoiding excessive calls during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer dereferences. The distance parameter must be calculated correctly
    using appropriate World of Warcraft API functions like GetDistance().
