  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of charges remaining on the game object template.
  description: The GetCharges method retrieves the current charge count associated
    with a GameObjectTemplate. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, game objects such
    as spellbooks, quest items, or magical artifacts may have a limited number of
    uses or charges before they become unusable. This value is typically defined in
    the database and represents how many times the object can be interacted with or
    activated before it depletes. The method provides access to this charge information
    for game logic that needs to handle consumable or limited-use objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of charges remaining on the GameObjectTemplate.
    If the object has unlimited charges, this value may be zero or a very large number
    depending on how it's defined in the database. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    that no charges are left or that the object does not utilize charges.
  examples:
  - title: Check GameObject Charges Before Use
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->GetCharges() > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interaction\
      \ logic\n    // Decrease charges using a setter method if available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectTemplate class which represents static
    data for game objects loaded from the database. It's important to note that charge
    handling may be managed separately in the GameObject instance itself rather than
    just in the template, so this value might not reflect real-time usage.
