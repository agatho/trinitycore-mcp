documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation of a creature to a specified CreatureGroup.
  description: This method assigns a creature to a specific formation group, allowing
    for coordinated behavior such as following, grouping, or other collective actions.
    The formation defines how the creature interacts with its group members in terms
    of positioning and movement. This is commonly used in AI systems to manage creature
    behavior within groups, particularly in scenarios where creatures need to maintain
    specific formations during combat or movement.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature *creature = new Creature();

      CreatureGroup *group = new CreatureGroup();

      creature->SetFormation(group);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during creature initialization or when setting
    up group behavior. It does not directly affect the creature's AI state but rather
    influences how it interacts with its group members in terms of movement and positioning.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to creatures not properly following
    their formation, resulting in erratic behavior or failure to maintain group cohesion
    during combat or movement.
