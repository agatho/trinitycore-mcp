  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: GetNextQuestInChain
  signature: uint32 DynamicQuestSystem::GetNextQuestInChain(uint32 completedQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest ID of the next quest in the chain following the specified
    completed quest.
  description: The GetNextQuestInChain method is used within the Dynamic Quest System
    to determine the subsequent quest that a player should receive after completing
    a specific quest. This method evaluates the quest chain structure and returns
    the identifier of the next logical quest in the sequence. It is typically invoked
    when a player completes a quest to automatically advance them to the next step
    in their quest progression. The method assumes that quest dependencies and chaining
    are properly configured within the game's quest system database. If no next quest
    exists in the chain, it may return 0 or a special value indicating end of chain.
  parameters:
  - name: completedQuestId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest that has been completed by
      the player. This ID must correspond to a valid quest entry in the game's database.
  returns: Returns the quest ID of the next quest in the chain following the completed
    quest. If there is no next quest in the chain, it returns 0, indicating end of
    progression or invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 nextQuestId = dynamicQuestSystem->GetNextQuestInChain(12345);\n\
      if (nextQuestId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with starting the next quest\n    player->AddQuest(nextQuestId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No more quests in chain\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quest chain completed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Quest Validation
    code: "uint32 currentQuestId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345);\nif (currentQuestId\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n    uint32 nextQuestId = dynamicQuestSystem->GetNextQuestInChain(12345);\n\
      \    if (nextQuestId != 0 && !player->HasQuest(nextQuestId))\n    {\n      \
      \  player->AddQuest(nextQuestId);\n        player->SendNotification(\"New quest\
      \ available: %s\", GetQuestNameById(nextQuestId));\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest chain configuration stored in the
    database. Developers should ensure that quest dependencies are correctly set up
    to avoid unexpected behavior. The method does not perform any validation on whether
    the provided quest ID actually exists or has been completed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent quest ID may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect quest progression. Always validate that a quest
    is truly completed before calling this method to prevent skipping quest steps
    or breaking quest chains.
