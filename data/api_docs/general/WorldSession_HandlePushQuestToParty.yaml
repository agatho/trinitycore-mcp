documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest invitation to all party members within range.
  description: The HandlePushQuestToParty method processes incoming client packets
    to push a quest invitation to nearby party members. When a player accepts a quest
    and uses the 'Share Quest' feature, this method is invoked to broadcast the quest
    invitation to all eligible party members in the same zone. The method checks if
    the player is in a party, validates the quest state, and sends appropriate packets
    to each party member within range. This functionality supports the World of Warcraft
    quest sharing mechanics where players can invite their party members to join ongoing
    quests.

  - title: Basic Quest Sharing
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePushQuestToParty(WorldPackets::Quest::PushQuestToParty&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (!GetPlayer()->GetGroup())\n        return;\n    \n   \
      \ // Process quest sharing logic\n    // Send packets to party members\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current group membership and quest state
    validation. It should only be called when a player has an active quest that can
    be shared with their party. The method handles packet sending internally and does
    not require additional network management.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the player is in a valid
    party and has an appropriate quest to share. Calling this method outside of proper
    quest sharing context may result in incorrect packet handling or client-side errors.
