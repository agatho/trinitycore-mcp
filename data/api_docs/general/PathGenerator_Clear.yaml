  signature: void PathGenerator::Clear()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all stored path data and resets the PathGenerator to its initial state.
  description: The Clear method resets the internal state of the PathGenerator, removing
    any previously calculated paths and clearing all associated data structures. This
    method is typically called before generating a new path to ensure that no stale
    or residual path information interferes with the new calculation. It prepares
    the generator for a fresh pathfinding operation by resetting its internal buffers
    and flags. The method does not take any parameters and has no return value, making
    it a simple state-reset operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Clear method
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // ... perform some pathfinding operations ...

      pathGen.Clear(); // Reset the generator for new path calculation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new pathfinding operation
    to prevent interference from previous calculations. It's commonly used in conjunction
    with other PathGenerator methods like GeneratePath or SetTarget to ensure clean
    state management.
