  method: GetDistanceToTarget
  signature: float ClassAI::GetDistanceToTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the AI-controlled unit
    and its current target.
  description: The GetDistanceToTarget method computes the straight-line distance
    from the AI-controlled creature or unit to its currently assigned target. This
    measurement is typically used in AI decision-making processes such as determining
    whether an attack is within range, deciding when to move closer to a target, or
    evaluating if a spell can be cast successfully. The method relies on the internal
    target tracking mechanism of the ClassAI and assumes that a valid target exists.
    If no target is set, the behavior may return an undefined or zero value depending
    on implementation details. This function is commonly used in combat AI logic where
    distance-based decisions are required for optimal gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's unique identifier
      (GUID). The method uses this to locate and calculate the distance to the specified
      target within the game world.
  returns: Returns a floating-point value representing the Euclidean distance in yards
    between the AI unit and its target. A return value of zero indicates either that
    no target is set or that the unit and target occupy the same position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Check
    code: "if (ai->GetDistanceToTarget(&targetGuid) < 5.0f)\n{\n    // Target is within\
      \ 5 yards\n    ai->DoMeleeAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Distance for Spell Casting
    code: "float distance = ai->GetDistanceToTarget(&targetGuid);\nif (distance >\
      \ 10.0f && distance < 30.0f)\n{\n    // Cast a ranged spell if target is at\
      \ medium range\n    ai->CastSpell(targetGuid, SPELL_RANGED_ATTACK);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct calculation using the positions of both the
    AI unit and the target. It does not account for obstacles or terrain that might
    affect actual movement or line-of-sight. The accuracy of the returned distance
    depends on the precision of the internal position tracking system and the validity
    of the provided target GUID.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing unit in the game world; otherwise, the result may be unpredictable
    or cause undefined behavior. Also note that if no target has been assigned, the
    returned value might not reflect meaningful distance data.
