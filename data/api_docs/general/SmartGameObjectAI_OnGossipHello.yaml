documentation:
  brief: Handles the player's interaction when greeting a smart game object via gossip
    interface
  description: The OnGossipHello method is invoked when a player interacts with a
    smart game object using the gossip system. This method serves as the entry point
    for customizing the behavior of game objects during player interaction, allowing
    developers to define what happens when a player opens the gossip menu associated
    with the object. It typically checks conditions, displays options, and may trigger
    events or actions based on the player's input or state. The method returns true
    if the gossip menu was successfully handled and false otherwise, indicating whether
    further processing should occur.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player.
      This parameter provides access to player data such as inventory, quest status,
      and faction information.
  returns: Returns true if the gossip interaction was successfully handled by this
    AI implementation; false if further processing or default behavior should be applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Hello Implementation
    code: "bool SmartGameObjectAI::OnGossipHello(Player* player)\n{\n    AddGossipItemFor(player,\
      \ GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"I want to trade.\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n    AddGossipItemFor(player,\
      \ GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Tell me about this place.\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 2);\n\
      \    SendGossipMenuFor(player, 10001, GetGameObject()->GetGUID());\n    return\
      \ true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gossip Handling Based on Player State
    code: "bool SmartGameObjectAI::OnGossipHello(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->HasQuest(QUEST_ID))\n\
      \    {\n        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Complete the quest.\"\
      , GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 3);\n        SendGossipMenuFor(player, 10002, GetGameObject()->GetGUID());\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        SendGossipMenuFor(player,\
      \ 10003, GetGameObject()->GetGUID());\n        return false;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI framework in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the gossip system to provide dynamic interactions. It's commonly overridden
    in custom AI implementations for game objects like quest givers, vendors, or event
    triggers. The method should not be used directly but rather through the SmartGameObjectAI
    base class.
  warnings: Improper handling of return values can lead to unexpected behavior in
    the gossip menu flow. Always ensure that proper menu items are added before calling
    SendGossipMenuFor, and avoid modifying player state within this method without
    considering potential side effects.
