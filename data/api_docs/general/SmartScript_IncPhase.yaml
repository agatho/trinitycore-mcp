  class: SmartScript
  method: IncPhase
  signature: void SmartScript::IncPhase(uint32 p)
documentation:
  brief: Increments the current phase of the SmartScript by the specified value.
  description: The IncPhase method increases the internal phase counter of a SmartScript
    instance by the provided value. This functionality is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft AI scripts to manage state transitions and conditional logic based on
    phase progression. The phase system allows for complex scripting behaviors where
    different actions are executed depending on the current phase. This method modifies
    the script's internal state directly, affecting subsequent conditional checks
    and behavior execution within the SmartScript framework.
  parameters:
  - name: p
    description: The value by which to increment the current phase. Must be a positive
      integer representing the phase offset to add to the existing phase value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Increment
    code: 'SmartScript* script = ...;

      script->IncPhase(1); // Increments current phase by 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Incrementing Phase in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (someCondition)\n{\n    script->IncPhase(5);\n    // Script will now\
      \ operate at phase 5 or higher\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal phase state of the SmartScript.
    It should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access
    to the same script instance might occur. The phase value is typically used in
    conjunction with other methods like GetPhase() or SetPhase() for complete phase
    management.
  warnings: Using large increment values may cause unexpected behavior if phase boundaries
    are not properly defined in the script logic. Ensure that all conditional checks
    and actions account for the increased phase values to avoid unintended execution
    paths.
