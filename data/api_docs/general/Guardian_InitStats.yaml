  class: Guardian
  method: InitStats
  signature: void Guardian::InitStats(int * summoner, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the statistics and properties of a guardian unit based on summoner's
    stats and duration.
  description: The InitStats method sets up the initial combat and attribute values
    for a Guardian object, typically invoked when a guardian is summoned by a player
    or creature. It configures the guardian's health, mana, damage, and other relevant
    stats according to the summoner's level, class, and the specified duration of
    the guardians' existence. This method ensures that the guardian behaves consistently
    with game mechanics and player expectations based on the summoner's power level
    and the intended lifespan of the summoned creature.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the summoner's level or stat modifier.
      Used to scale guardian stats appropriately.
  - name: duration
    description: Integer value indicating the duration in seconds for which the guardian
      will exist. Affects how stats are calculated and managed over time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guardian Initialization
    code: 'int summonerLevel = 60;

      int durationSeconds = 300;

      Guardian* guardian = new Guardian();

      guardian->InitStats(&summonerLevel, durationSeconds);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Guardian with Dynamic Summoner Stats
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      int summonerLevel = player->getLevel();

      int duration = 180;

      Guardian* pet = new Guardian();

      pet->InitStats(&summonerLevel, duration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the creation or summoning phase of
    a guardian unit. It's crucial that the summoner parameter points to valid data,
    as incorrect values may result in improperly scaled stats for the guardian. The
    method assumes standard TrinityCore game mechanics and does not account for custom
    modifications unless explicitly implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the summoner pointer is not null before calling InitStats,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. Also, be aware that duration
    values may affect how the guardian's stats decay or change over time if such behavior
    is implemented in the game logic.
