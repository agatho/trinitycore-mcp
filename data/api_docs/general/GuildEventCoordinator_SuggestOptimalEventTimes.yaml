  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::SuggestOptimalEventTimes(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Suggests optimal times for guild events based on member availability and
    guild activity patterns.
  description: The SuggestOptimalEventTimes method analyzes guild member online patterns,
    activity levels, and historical event participation data to recommend the best
    possible times for scheduling new guild events. This method is designed to maximize
    attendance and engagement by identifying periods when the highest number of guild
    members are typically available. The algorithm considers factors such as peak
    gaming hours, member time zones, and previous event success rates. It does not
    actually schedule events but provides data-driven recommendations that can be
    used by guild leaders or event coordinators to make informed decisions about event
    timing.

  notes: This method likely performs database queries to retrieve member activity
    data and may involve significant computational processing for pattern analysis.
    It should be called during periods of low server load to avoid performance impact.
    The suggestions are based on statistical analysis and may not account for individual
    member exceptions or special circumstances.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid guild ID (e.g., zero or non-existent)
    may result in undefined behavior or no action being taken. The method assumes
    that guild member data is up-to-date and accurate, so stale data could lead to
    suboptimal recommendations.
