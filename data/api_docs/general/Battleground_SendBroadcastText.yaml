  class: Battleground
  method: SendBroadcastText
  signature: void Battleground::SendBroadcastText(int id, int msgType, const WorldObject
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a broadcast text message to all players in the battleground.
  description: The SendBroadcastText method is used to send a localized text message
    to all players currently participating in the battleground. This method typically
    utilizes the battleground's internal messaging system to display messages such
    as objective captures, timer warnings, or game state updates. The method takes
    a message ID, which corresponds to a string entry in the database, and optionally
    targets a specific WorldObject for the message context. Messages are sent using
    the player's client-side localization system, ensuring that players see the appropriate
    language version of the message. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    clear communication during battleground events and is commonly used by battleground
    scripts and game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The message ID that corresponds to a localized string entry in the
      database. This ID typically maps to a text message defined in the game's localization
      tables.
  - name: msgType
    description: The type of message being sent, which determines how the message
      is displayed to players (e.g., system message, chat, or objective notification).
      Valid values are typically defined by the game's message type constants.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject that serves as the target of the broadcast
      message. This can be used to provide context for the message (e.g., which player
      or object triggered the event). Can be NULL if no specific target is needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast a simple objective capture message
    code: battleground->SendBroadcastText(12345, CHAT_MSG_BG_SYSTEM_NEUTRAL, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: Broadcast a message with specific target context
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a player reference

      battleground->SendBroadcastText(12346, CHAT_MSG_BG_SYSTEM_ALLIANCE, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from battleground scripts or game logic to
    communicate important events to players. The message ID must correspond to a valid
    string in the database, otherwise no message will be displayed. The method does
    not perform any validation on the message type parameter, so invalid values may
    result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the message ID provided corresponds to an existing localized
    string entry in the database. Using an invalid ID may cause silent failures or
    display nothing to players. Avoid calling this method from within critical sections
    of code where performance is crucial, as it may involve sending packets to multiple
    clients simultaneously.
