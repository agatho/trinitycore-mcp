  class: SpellDestination
  method: Relocate
  signature: void SpellDestination::Relocate(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the spell destination position based on the provided coordinate value.
  description: The Relocate method adjusts the target location for a spell by updating
    its positional coordinates. This method is typically used during spell casting
    to dynamically modify where a spell will land or affect targets. The method accepts
    a reference to an integer representing the new position coordinate and applies
    this change to the spell destination's internal positioning data. It's commonly
    invoked when spells need to be repositioned due to movement, environmental changes,
    or targeting adjustments during combat. This operation directly modifies the spell's
    destination without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the new coordinate position
      for the spell destination. This typically corresponds to a specific axis (X,
      Y, or Z) in the game world coordinate system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Update
    code: 'SpellDestination dest;

      int newPosition = 1500;

      dest.Relocate(newPosition);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Spell Target During Combat
    code: "SpellDestination* spellDest = player->GetSpellDestination();\nif (spellDest)\n\
      {\n    int targetX = player->GetPositionX() + 50;\n    spellDest->Relocate(targetX);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal spell destination data and should
    only be called when the spell's target position needs to be updated. The 'pos'
    parameter is passed by reference, so modifications to the original value will
    not affect the method's behavior. This method does not validate the coordinate
    values against world boundaries or spell restrictions.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may result in invalid spell
    targeting. Ensure that the position value provided is within valid game world
    coordinates and appropriate for the spell being cast. Improper use can lead to
    spells targeting invalid locations or failing to hit intended targets.
