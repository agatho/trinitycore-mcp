documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is a trigger entity
  description: The IsTrigger method checks if a creature instance is classified as
    a trigger within the TrinityCore framework. This is typically used for creatures
    that are designed to activate other game mechanics or events without being actual
    combatants. Trigger creatures often have special behavior such as being invisible,
    having no aggro, or serving as part of a quest or event system. The method returns
    true when the creature has been flagged as a trigger entity, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is a trigger, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the creature's behavior is designed to activate events or mechanisms rather
    than engage in combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsTrigger()) {\n    // Handle trigger-specific logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in conjunction with other creature-related
    functions to determine the proper behavior of a creature. It's often used in event
    handling systems where triggers are used to activate specific game mechanics.
