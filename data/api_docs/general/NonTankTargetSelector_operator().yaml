documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a target unit is suitable for non-tank AI behavior in combat.
  description: The NonTankTargetSelector::operator() method determines if a given
    Unit target meets the criteria for selection by non-tank AI logic. This selector
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes where the primary tank should
    not be targeted, and alternative targets are needed. The method evaluates various
    conditions such as target validity, threat level, and combat state to decide whether
    the unit qualifies as a valid non-tank target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is suitable for non-tank AI behavior (i.e.,
    not the primary tank and meets other selection criteria), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (NonTankTargetSelector()(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with non-tank\
      \ target logic\n    ai->SetCurrentTarget(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Selection System
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (!UpdateVictim())\n            return;\n        \n\
      \        Unit* target = nullptr;\n        if (SelectTarget(SelectTargetMethod::SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM,\
      \ 0, 0.0f, true, NonTankTargetSelector())) {\n            target = SelectTarget(SelectTargetMethod::SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM,\
      \ 0, 0.0f, true, NonTankTargetSelector());\n        }\n        \n        if\
      \ (target)\n            AttackStart(target);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI implementations for creatures that should
    avoid targeting the primary tank, particularly in group encounters. The selector
    may consider factors like target health, threat level, and whether the unit is
    already being targeted by another AI agent.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method to
    prevent undefined behavior. This method assumes that the Unit pointer points to
    a valid object within the game world.
