documentation:
  brief: Schedules a bot logout at a specified time in the future
  description: The ScheduleLogout method is used to queue a bot for automatic logout
    at a specific time in the future. This functionality allows for controlled bot
    management, enabling bots to log out at predetermined intervals or events without
    requiring immediate manual intervention. The method takes a bot's unique identifier
    and a time offset value to determine when the logout should occur. This is particularly
    useful in automated bot systems where bots need to be managed efficiently over
    extended periods.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that needs to be scheduled
      for logout
  - name: when
    description: Time offset in seconds from current time when the bot should logout
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Logout Scheduling
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.ScheduleLogout(12345, 3600); // Schedule bot with GUID 12345 to logout
      in 1 hour'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Bot Logout Scheduling
    code: "BotScheduler scheduler;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    scheduler.ScheduleLogout(1000\
      \ + i, 1800 + (i * 300)); // Schedule 10 bots with increasing delays\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal timer or event queue system to manage
    bot logout scheduling. The 'when' parameter represents a relative time offset
    from the current moment, not an absolute timestamp. Implementation may involve
    thread-safe operations for managing concurrent bot schedules.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to an active bot, otherwise
    the scheduling operation may fail silently or cause undefined behavior. Be cautious
    when scheduling multiple logouts in rapid succession as this could overwhelm the
    scheduler system.
