    guid)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a player GUID to the list of already members in a group or guild.
  description: The PlayerAlreadyMemberAppend method is used to add a player's unique
    identifier (GUID) to a collection that tracks which players have already been
    added to a specific group or guild. This functionality is typically utilized during
    group creation, invitation processes, or membership validation within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method ensures no duplicate entries are made for the same player
    and maintains data integrity in group-related operations. It operates on the principle
    of preventing redundant member additions and maintaining accurate membership records.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be appended to the
      already members list. This value must represent a valid player entity within
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Player GUID to Already Members List
    code: 'PlayerAlreadyMemberAppend appendHandler;

      uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      appendHandler.PlayerAlreadyMemberAppend(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within a container or list structure that stores
    GUIDs of players who are already members. It may perform internal checks to ensure
    the GUID isn't already present before appending, though this behavior is not explicitly
    stated in the signature.
