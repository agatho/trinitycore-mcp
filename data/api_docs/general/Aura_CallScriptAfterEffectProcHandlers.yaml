  signature: void Aura::CallScriptAfterEffectProcHandlers(AuraEffect * aurEff, const
    AuraApplication * aurApp, ProcEventInfo & eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Calls all script handlers after an aura effect proc occurs.
  description: The CallScriptAfterEffectProcHandlers method is responsible for invoking
    all registered script handlers that are designed to execute after a proc event
    has been triggered by an aura effect. This method ensures that any custom logic
    defined in the aura's script handlers is executed at the appropriate time during
    the proc sequence, allowing for complex interactions and effects to be applied
    when an aura's proc condition is met. The method takes into account the specific
    aura effect and application context along with the event information to properly
    dispatch these handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect that triggered the proc event. This parameter
      specifies which effect within the aura caused the proc.
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication associated with this aura effect.
      Provides context about how the aura is applied to a unit.
  - name: eventInfo
    description: Reference to a ProcEventInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the proc event, including triggering conditions and involved units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Aura Script
    code: "void MyAuraScript::AfterEffectProc(AuraEffect const* aurEff, AuraApplication\
      \ const* aurApp, ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n    // Perform custom logic here\n\
      \    if (eventInfo.GetDamage())\n    {\n        // Apply additional effects\
      \ or modify damage\n    }\n    // Call base handler to ensure all scripts are\
      \ invoked\n    CallScriptAfterEffectProcHandlers(aurEff, aurApp, eventInfo);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore aura system
    during proc handling. Developers should not normally need to call this directly
    unless implementing custom aura behavior that requires explicit script invocation
    after proc events.
