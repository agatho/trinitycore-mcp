  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: AnalyzeSpellCast
  signature: DetectedSpellCast InterruptAwareness::AnalyzeSpellCast(Unit * caster,
    const Spell * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes a spell cast by a unit and returns information about the detected
    spell cast.
  description: The AnalyzeSpellCast method examines the spell casting behavior of
    a given unit, processing the spell data to determine key attributes of the cast.
    This method is typically used in AI or combat logic systems to detect and respond
    to specific spell casts. It evaluates the caster's state, the spell being cast,
    and related contextual information to produce a structured result. The method
    does not modify any internal state but provides read-only analysis of spell casting
    events.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting the spell. Must be a valid
      unit instance, typically a player or creature.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object representing the spell being cast. Must
      not be null and should represent an active spell in the casting process.
  returns: Returns a DetectedSpellCast object containing detailed information about
    the analyzed spell cast, including spell ID, caster GUID, cast time, and other
    relevant metadata.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "DetectedSpellCast detected = interruptAwareness.AnalyzeSpellCast(casterUnit,\
      \ currentSpell);\nif (detected.spellId == 12345)\n{\n    // Handle specific\
      \ spell cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using analyzed data for interrupt detection
    code: "DetectedSpellCast result = interruptAwareness.AnalyzeSpellCast(unit, spell);\n\
      if (result.castTime > 1000)\n{\n    // Potential long cast that might be interrupted\n\
      \    DoInterruptLogic();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for use in AI systems or combat analysis modules.
    It assumes the spell and caster are valid and actively casting. The method does
    not perform any side effects or modifications to the spell or unit state.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'caster' and 'spell' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null values may lead to undefined behavior. This
    method should only be called during active spell casting events.
