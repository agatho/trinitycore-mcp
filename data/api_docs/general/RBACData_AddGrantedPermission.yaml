  signature: void RBACData::AddGrantedPermission(uint32 permissionId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a granted permission to the RBAC data structure for the associated account
    or player.
  description: The AddGrantedPermission method is used to grant a specific permission
    to an account or player within the TrinityCore authentication and authorization
    system. This method adds the specified permission ID to the internal collection
    of granted permissions, which are then checked during access control decisions.
    The method does not validate whether the permission ID exists in the system; it
    simply adds it to the list of granted permissions for the RBAC data instance.
    This is typically used when assigning permissions to players or accounts through
    administrative tools or in-game commands.
  parameters:
  - name: permissionId
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to be granted. This ID must
      correspond to a valid permission defined in the TrinityCore permission system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Granting a Basic Permission
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      rbacData.AddGrantedPermission(1001); // Grants permission ID 1001 to the account'
    language: cpp
  - title: Granting Multiple Permissions
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      rbacData.AddGrantedPermission(1001);

      rbacData.AddGrantedPermission(1002);

      rbacData.AddGrantedPermission(1003); // Grants multiple permissions to the account'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the RBACData object directly.
    The permission ID should be validated against existing permissions in the system
    before calling this method to avoid granting invalid permissions. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with other RBAC methods like AddReservedPermission
    or CheckPermission.
  warnings: Adding a permission ID that does not exist in the permission system may
    lead to unexpected behavior during access checks. Always ensure that the permission
    IDs being granted are valid and defined within the TrinityCore permission framework.
