  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetPhasesForGroup(uint32 group) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of phase IDs associated with a specified group from the
    DB2 data files.
  description: The GetPhasesForGroup method retrieves an array of phase identifiers
    that are linked to a given group within the TrinityCore database. This functionality
    is primarily used for managing and applying game phases in World of Warcraft content,
    such as determining which phases should be active for specific groups of players
    or objects. The returned pointer points to an internal static array, so callers
    must not attempt to free or modify the data. The method assumes that phase group
    mappings have been properly loaded into memory via DB2 files, typically during
    server initialization or map loading processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing the phase IDs associated
    with the specified group. Returns NULL if no phases are found for the given group
    or if the group ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through phases for a group
    code: "const int* phases = sDB2Manager->GetPhasesForGroup(1234);\nif (phases)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; phases[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Phase ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", phases[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses pre-loaded DB2 data structures, which are typically
    initialized at server startup. The returned array is null-terminated and should
    be treated as read-only. Performance is optimized for frequent lookups but depends
    on the internal data structure used to store phase group mappings.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or free the memory pointed to by the returned
    value. Ensure that the group ID passed to this method exists in the DB2 files;
    otherwise, it may return NULL without error indication.
