  signature: float AdaptiveDifficulty::GetOptimalDifficulty(int playerGuid, float
    currentSkill) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal difficulty level for a player based on
    their GUID and current skill.
  description: The GetOptimalDifficulty method computes the appropriate difficulty
    setting for a player within the Adaptive Difficulty system. It takes into account
    the player's unique identifier (GUID) and their current skill level to determine
    an optimal difficulty that balances challenge and gameplay enjoyment. This method
    is typically used in dynamic difficulty adjustment systems where the game adapts
    to player performance. The calculation considers various factors such as player
    progression, previous performance data, and game balance parameters to ensure
    a consistent and engaging experience across different skill levels.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom difficulty is
      being calculated. This value should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: currentSkill
    description: The current skill level of the player, represented as a floating-point
      value. This typically reflects the player's performance or expertise in the
      relevant game context.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated optimal difficulty level.
    The value typically ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 represents the easiest
    difficulty and 1.0 represents the most challenging. Values may exceed 1.0 in certain
    edge cases or for advanced difficulty scaling.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float difficulty = adaptiveDifficulty.GetOptimalDifficulty(12345, 75.5f);

      // Returns the optimal difficulty for player with GUID 12345 and current skill
      of 75.5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with player management system
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(playerGuid));\n\
      if (player)\n{\n    float skillLevel = player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_ARCHAEOLOGY);\n\
      \    float optimalDifficulty = adaptiveDifficulty.GetOptimalDifficulty(playerGuid,\
      \ skillLevel);\n    // Apply the difficulty to current game session\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty system and relies
    on internal player data and configuration settings. The calculation may vary based
    on server-side difficulty adjustment parameters, player progression curves, and
    game balance settings. Performance is generally good as it only performs necessary
    calculations based on provided GUID and skill values.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an existing player
    in the database, otherwise the method may return unexpected results or cause errors.
    The currentSkill parameter should be validated to prevent negative values that
    could skew difficulty calculations.
