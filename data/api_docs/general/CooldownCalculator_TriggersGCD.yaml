  signature: bool CooldownCalculator::TriggersGCD(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell triggers the Global Cooldown (GCD) in World of
    Warcraft.
  description: The TriggersGCD method evaluates whether a given spell ID will cause
    the player to enter a Global Cooldown state, which prevents other actions from
    being executed for a set period. This is a core mechanic in World of Warcraft
    that ensures balanced gameplay by preventing rapid-fire casting of abilities.
    The method typically checks against internal spell data and game rules to determine
    if the specified spell should initiate the GCD. It's commonly used in cooldown
    management systems, action queue logic, and spell validation routines within TrinityCore's
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell triggers the Global Cooldown, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the spell will prevent other actions from being
    performed for the duration of the GCD.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (cooldownCalculator.TriggersGCD(12345)) {\n    // Spell 12345 triggers\
      \ GCD\n    // Handle cooldown logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "uint32 spellId = player->GetCurrentSpellCast()->GetSpellInfo()->Id;\nif\
      \ (cooldownCalculator.TriggersGCD(spellId)) {\n    player->AddGlobalCooldown(1500);\
      \ // Apply 1.5 second GCD\n    // Proceed with GCD-based cooldown handling\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell database entries that define
    which spells are subject to the Global Cooldown. The implementation may cache
    results for performance reasons, especially since this check is performed frequently
    during spell execution. It's important to note that not all abilities trigger
    GCD - such as some utility spells or passive abilities.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid spell IDs that exist in the
    game database. Using invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    GCD calculations. Additionally, since this is a core gameplay mechanic, changes
    to this method's logic could significantly impact player experience and game balance.
