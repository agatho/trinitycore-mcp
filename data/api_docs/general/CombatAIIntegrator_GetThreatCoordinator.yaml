  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: GetThreatCoordinator
  signature: ThreatCoordinator * CombatAIIntegrator::GetThreatCoordinator() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the threat coordinator instance used for managing threat levels
    in combat.
  description: The GetThreatCoordinator method returns a pointer to the ThreatCoordinator
    object associated with this CombatAIIntegrator. The ThreatCoordinator is responsible
    for tracking and managing threat values among units in combat, ensuring proper
    aggro distribution and AI behavior based on threat levels. This method provides
    access to the core threat management system that governs how NPCs prioritize targets
    and maintain combat engagement. The returned pointer is valid for the lifetime
    of the CombatAIIntegrator instance and should not be deleted by the caller.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ThreatCoordinator instance used by this CombatAIIntegrator,
    or nullptr if no threat coordinator has been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = combatAI->GetThreatCoordinator();\nif\
      \ (coordinator)\n{\n    // Use the threat coordinator for managing combat\n\
      \    coordinator->AddThreat(target, 100.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Threat Level
    code: "CombatAIIntegrator* combatAI = unit->GetCombatAI();\nif (combatAI)\n{\n\
      \    ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = combatAI->GetThreatCoordinator();\n  \
      \  if (coordinator)\n    {\n        float threatLevel = coordinator->GetThreat(unit,\
      \ target);\n        // Process threat level for AI decision making\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ThreatCoordinator returned by this method is typically initialized during
    the CombatAIIntegrator's construction or when combat begins. This method should
    only be called on valid CombatAIIntegrator instances that are actively managing
    combat behavior.
  warnings: Do not delete or modify the returned ThreatCoordinator pointer. The lifetime
    of the coordinator is managed by the CombatAIIntegrator instance, and deleting
    it may cause undefined behavior or crashes.
