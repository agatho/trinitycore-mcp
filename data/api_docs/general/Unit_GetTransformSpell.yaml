  method: GetTransformSpell
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetTransformSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell ID associated with the current transformation state of
    the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the unique spell identifier that is currently
    active for transforming the unit into a specific form or state. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with aura effects and transformation mechanics to determine
    what spell is currently applied to the unit. The returned value represents the
    spell ID which can be used to check if a particular transformation is active or
    to perform further actions related to that transformation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the spell ID of the current transformation, or 0 if no transformation
    is active. This value typically corresponds to a specific spell that defines the
    visual and mechanical effects of the transformation.
  examples:
  - title: Check Transformation Spell
    code: "uint32 transformSpell = unit->GetTransformSpell();\nif (transformSpell\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // A transformation is active\n    // Do something with the\
      \ spell ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods like GetAura
    or GetSpellInfo to determine the full context of a transformation. It may be called
    frequently during gameplay, so performance considerations should be taken into
    account when using it in loops or conditional logic.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method because the returned spell ID
    may not always correspond to a valid spell in all cases. If a unit is not transformed,
    this method will return 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled
    properly.
