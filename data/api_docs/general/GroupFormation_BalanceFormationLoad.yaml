  brief: Loads and initializes the group formation balance data for all active groups
    in the world.
  description: The BalanceFormationLoad method is responsible for loading and initializing
    the balance-related formation data for all currently active groups within the
    TrinityCore instance. This method ensures that group formations are properly configured
    according to the server's balance settings, which may include adjustments for
    player distribution, role assignments, or tactical positioning. It typically runs
    during server startup or when balance configuration changes are detected. The
    method does not require any parameters and performs its operations internally
    using the GroupFormation system's data structures and configuration files.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n    GroupFormation::BalanceFormationLoad();\n\
      \    // Continue with other systems\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or when configuration
    files are reloaded. It may involve reading from database tables or configuration
    files that store formation balance settings. The method assumes that the GroupFormation
    system has been properly initialized before execution.
