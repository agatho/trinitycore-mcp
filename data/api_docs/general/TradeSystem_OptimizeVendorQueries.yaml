  method: OptimizeVendorQueries
  signature: void TradeSystem::OptimizeVendorQueries()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes vendor item queries by reducing database load and improving performance
    during trade interactions.
  description: The OptimizeVendorQueries method enhances the efficiency of vendor-related
    database operations within the TradeSystem. It minimizes redundant queries when
    players interact with vendors, particularly during item browsing, purchasing,
    or selling processes. This optimization reduces server resource consumption and
    improves response times for trade-related actions. The method typically groups
    similar queries together, caches frequently accessed vendor data, and employs
    batch retrieval techniques to decrease the number of individual database calls.
    It is automatically invoked during trade system initialization and can also be
    manually triggered when significant changes occur in vendor inventories or trade
    configurations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TradeSystem* tradeSys = sWorld->GetTradeSystem();

      tradeSys->OptimizeVendorQueries();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after major vendor inventory updates or when
    the system detects performance degradation. It is designed to be thread-safe and
    can be safely invoked from any game thread context. The optimization process may
    temporarily increase memory usage due to caching mechanisms.
  warnings: Invoking this method too frequently without proper conditions may lead
    to unnecessary overhead. Ensure that vendor data has actually changed before calling
    this function to avoid performance degradation.
