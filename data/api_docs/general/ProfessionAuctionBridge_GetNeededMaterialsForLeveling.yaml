  signature: int ProfessionAuctionBridge::GetNeededMaterialsForLeveling(int * player,
    ProfessionType profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required material quantities needed for leveling up a player's
    profession.
  description: The GetNeededMaterialsForLeveling method calculates and returns the
    number of materials required for a player to level up their specified profession.
    This method is typically used in auction house or crafting systems where players
    need to know what resources are necessary to advance their skill level. The function
    takes into account the current skill level, the target level, and any applicable
    modifiers or requirements defined by the game's profession system. It does not
    modify any state but rather computes and returns a value based on internal profession
    data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter identifies which player's profession data should be queried.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value of type ProfessionType that specifies the particular
      profession for which materials are being calculated. Valid values correspond
      to known professions in the game such as Alchemy, Blacksmithing, etc.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the total quantity of materials needed
    for leveling up the specified profession. A return value of zero indicates no
    materials are required or that the operation failed due to invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerGUID = 12345;\nProfessionType prof = PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING;\n\
      int neededMaterials = bridge.GetNeededMaterialsForLeveling(&playerGUID, prof);\n\
      if (neededMaterials > 0) {\n    printf(\"You need %d materials to level up your\
      \ blacksmithing skill.\\n\", neededMaterials);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and profession parameters are valid and
    properly initialized. It may internally access global profession tables or databases,
    so performance should be considered when called frequently in tight loops. The
    returned value is dependent on the current state of the player's profession data.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player session; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Also, make sure the ProfessionType
    enum value is one of the supported professions to avoid unexpected results.
