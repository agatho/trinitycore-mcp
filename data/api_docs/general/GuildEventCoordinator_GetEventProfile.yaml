  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: GetEventProfile
  signature: EventCoordinationProfile GuildEventCoordinator::GetEventProfile(uint32
    playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the event coordination profile associated with a specified player
    GUID.
  description: The GetEventProfile method fetches the EventCoordinationProfile for
    a given player identifier. This profile typically contains information about the
    player's current event participation status, scheduled events, and related coordination
    data within the guild context. The method is used by the GuildEventCoordinator
    to manage and retrieve player-specific event-related data for processing or display
    purposes. It assumes that the player GUID corresponds to an active member of a
    guild with ongoing event activities.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose event profile is
      being retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns an EventCoordinationProfile object containing the event-related
    data for the specified player. If no profile exists or the player is not found,
    the returned profile may be empty or contain default values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "EventCoordinationProfile profile = guildEventCoordinator->GetEventProfile(12345);\n\
      if (!profile.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Process event data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Event Participation Status
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nEventCoordinationProfile\
      \ profile = guildEventCoordinator->GetEventProfile(playerId);\nif (profile.HasActiveEvent())\
      \ {\n    // Notify player of active event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database lookups and should be used judiciously
    to avoid performance degradation. The returned profile object may contain cached
    data depending on the implementation details of GuildEventCoordinator.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid is valid before calling this method, as invalid
    GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior or database errors. This method does not
    validate whether the player is actually in a guild.
