  signature: void CreatureAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles creature AI behavior when an entity enters the creature's line of
    sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core part of the CreatureAI system
    in TrinityCore, invoked whenever an object (such as a player or unit) moves into
    the creature's line of sight. This method typically triggers the AI to initiate
    combat behavior, pursue targets, or perform other actions based on the creature's
    AI script and configuration. It is automatically called by the core engine when
    movement events occur within the creature's detection range. The method does not
    take any parameters directly; it operates on the internal state of the CreatureAI
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic AI Reaction to Player Movement
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(Unit*\
      \ who) override {\n        if (who && who->IsPlayer()) {\n            // Trigger\
      \ combat or alert behavior\n            AttackStart(who);\n        }\n     \
      \   CreatureAI::MoveInLineOfSight(who);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically overridden in custom AI implementations to define
    specific behaviors when entities enter the creature's line of sight. It is part
    of the standard event-driven AI system and should not be called manually unless
    implementing a custom override.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method directly from outside the AI framework, as it
    may interfere with core engine behavior. Ensure proper inheritance and override
    patterns when extending CreatureAI functionality.
