documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the next waypoint identifier for a group within an instance coordination
    system.
  description: The GetNextWaypoint method is used to determine the next logical waypoint
    in an instance coordination sequence for a specified group. This functionality
    is typically employed in scripted instance events or quest progression where groups
    must follow a defined path through an instance. The method likely maintains internal
    state tracking for each group's current position and returns the subsequent waypoint
    ID that should be targeted by the group. It may be part of a larger system managing
    group movement, event sequencing, or instance-specific objectives.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the identifier of the next waypoint in
    the sequence. A return value of -1 typically indicates an error condition such
    as invalid group state or no more waypoints available. Positive integers represent
    valid waypoint IDs that can be used to direct group movement or trigger subsequent
    events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nint nextWaypoint = instanceCoordination->GetNextWaypoint(myGroup);\n\
      if (nextWaypoint >= 0)\n{\n    // Proceed to waypoint\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"scripts\"\
      , \"Moving group to waypoint %d\", nextWaypoint);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ error or end of sequence\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"scripts\", \"No valid waypoint\
      \ found for group\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state management for groups and may
    be part of a larger coordination system. The implementation might involve checking
    group validity, maintaining current waypoint tracking, and potentially interacting
    with instance data structures. Performance is generally low impact as it's a simple
    lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    otherwise behavior may be undefined or result in crashes. This method should only
    be called within appropriate instance contexts where waypoint coordination is
    active.
