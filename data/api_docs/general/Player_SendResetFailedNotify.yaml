  method: SendResetFailedNotify
  signature: void Player::SendResetFailedNotify(uint32 mapid) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a reset failure notification to the player when they attempt to enter
    a specific map.
  description: This method sends a notification message to the player indicating that
    their attempt to enter a particular map has failed, typically due to requirements
    not being met or other game mechanics preventing entry. The method is used in
    conjunction with map resetting functionality and may be triggered when a player
    tries to enter a map that requires specific conditions to be satisfied, such as
    level requirements or quest prerequisites. It is commonly used during dungeon
    or raid instance entry processes where the player's access is denied due to unmet
    criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: mapid
    description: The identifier of the map that failed to reset. This parameter specifies
      which map the player attempted to enter and failed to access due to unmet requirements
      or game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendResetFailedNotify(123);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->GetEntry() == 567)\n{\n    player->SendResetFailedNotify(567);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other reset-related methods
    and may be part of a larger system that handles map entry restrictions. It should
    be called when the player's attempt to enter a map fails due to unmet requirements
    or game mechanics, such as level restrictions or quest prerequisites.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly unless the player is attempting
    to enter a map that has failed to reset due to unmet criteria. Misusing this method
    could lead to incorrect notifications being sent to players, potentially causing
    confusion in gameplay.
