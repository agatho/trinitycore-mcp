api:
  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: GetOptimalPositionForMember
  signature: int PlayerbotGroupManager::GetOptimalPositionForMember(uint32 groupId,
    uint32 memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position index for a group member within
    a player bot group.
  description: The GetOptimalPositionForMember method determines the best positional
    slot for a specified group member within a player bot group. This calculation
    considers factors such as role distribution, positioning strategy, and group composition
    to ensure balanced team formation. The returned index represents where in the
    group's formation layout this member should be placed. The method is typically
    used during group creation or reorganization to maintain tactical balance and
    optimal gameplay positioning.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the player bot group for which to calculate
      the position
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the specific group member whose optimal
      position is being calculated
  returns: An integer representing the optimal position index within the group. Returns
    -1 if the group or member cannot be found, or if positioning calculation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int position = botGroupManager->GetOptimalPositionForMember(12345, 67890);\n\
      if (position >= 0) {\n    // Use the calculated position for group formation\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Optimal position: \" << position << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to calculate optimal position\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "uint32 groupId = playerBot->GetGroupId();\nuint32 memberGuid = playerBot->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      int optimalPos = botGroupManager->GetOptimalPositionForMember(groupId, memberGuid);\n\
      if (optimalPos >= 0) {\n    // Update group formation with calculated position\n\
      \    playerBot->SetFormationPosition(optimalPos);\n    // Notify other members\
      \ of new positioning\n    botGroupManager->SendFormationUpdate(groupId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot AI system and relies on internal group
    state tracking. It assumes that both the group and member exist within the current
    player bot manager context. The calculation may vary based on current group roles,
    available positions, and tactical configurations.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid groupId or memberGuid values will result
    in a return value of -1. Ensure that the group and member are valid before calling
    to avoid incorrect positioning calculations.
