  signature: void LFGMgr::SendLfgRoleCheckUpdate(int guid, const LfgRoleCheck & roleCheck)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG role check update to the specified player
  description: The SendLfgRoleCheckUpdate method is responsible for transmitting the
    current LFG (Looking For Group) role check information to a specific player identified
    by their GUID. This method is typically invoked during group formation processes
    when players need to confirm their roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) for a dungeon
    or raid instance. The role check update includes details about the proposed group
    composition and expected roles for each participant. It ensures that all players
    in the LFG queue are synchronized with the current role assignments and can make
    informed decisions about joining or leaving the group.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to whom the LFG role check
      update will be sent. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's
      object identifier in the game world.
  - name: roleCheck
    description: A constant reference to an LfgRoleCheck structure containing the
      current role assignment information for the group. This includes details about
      which players have accepted roles and their designated positions (tank, healer,
      damage).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendLfgRoleCheckUpdate
    code: 'uint32 playerGuid = 12345;

      LfgRoleCheck roleCheck;

      // ... populate roleCheck with data ...

      LFGMgr::instance()->SendLfgRoleCheckUpdate(playerGuid, roleCheck);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called when a role
    check is actively in progress. The method likely handles network serialization
    and transmission to ensure that players receive real-time updates about group
    roles.
