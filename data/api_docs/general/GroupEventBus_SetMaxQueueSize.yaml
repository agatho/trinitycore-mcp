  class: GroupEventBus
  method: SetMaxQueueSize
  signature: void GroupEventBus::SetMaxQueueSize(uint32 size)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum queue size for the group event bus.
  description: The SetMaxQueueSize method configures the maximum number of events
    that can be queued within the GroupEventBus before new events are dropped or handled
    according to the bus's policy. This method is typically used to control memory
    usage and performance characteristics of event processing within group-based systems
    such as raids or dungeons. The queue size directly affects how many events can
    be buffered before being processed, which is critical for maintaining responsiveness
    in high-frequency event scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The maximum number of events that the group event bus queue can hold.
      Valid values are positive integers representing the capacity of the internal
      queue buffer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Queue Size to 100 Events
    code: 'GroupEventBus* eventBus = new GroupEventBus();

      eventBus->SetMaxQueueSize(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Event Bus for High-Performance Environment
    code: 'GroupEventBus* raidEventBus = sGroupEventBus->GetRaidEventBus();

      raidEventBus->SetMaxQueueSize(500); // Allow higher queue size for raid events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before the event bus begins processing events
    to ensure proper initialization. Changing the queue size after events have started
    being queued may lead to unexpected behavior or dropped events.
  warnings: Setting an excessively large queue size can cause memory bloat and potential
    performance degradation. Conversely, setting it too low might result in frequent
    event drops during high-load periods.
