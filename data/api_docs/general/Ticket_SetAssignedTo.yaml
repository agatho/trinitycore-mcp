  brief: Assigns a ticket to a specific game master identified by GUID
  description: The SetAssignedTo method assigns a support ticket to a game master
    within the TrinityCore server. This method updates the ticket's assignment status
    and records the GUID of the assigned game master. The assignment typically occurs
    when a game master accepts responsibility for resolving a player's issue. The
    method does not validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to an active game
    master, so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure the target is a valid administrator.
    This method is part of the ticketing system used by TrinityCore's in-game support
    functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game master to whom the ticket
      should be assigned. This value must correspond to a valid player account with
      administrator privileges.
  - name: param1
    description: A boolean flag that likely controls additional assignment behavior,
      such as whether to send a notification to the assigned game master or update
      related timestamps. The exact meaning depends on internal implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Ticket Assignment
    code: 'Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketById(12345);

      ticket->SetAssignedTo(98765, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning Ticket with Notification Flag
    code: 'uint32 gmGuid = sObjectMgr->GetPlayerGUIDByName("AdminUser");

      Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByPlayerGUID(playerGuid);

      ticket->SetAssignedTo(gmGuid, false); // No notification sent'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal ticket state and should be called only when
    appropriate. The assignment does not automatically update the ticket's status
    field; additional logic may be required to transition the ticket into an 'in progress'
    or 'assigned' state. Consider that this method is typically used in conjunction
    with other ticket management functions.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID actually refers to a valid game master account,
    as invalid assignments can cause issues with ticket tracking and player support
    workflows. The param1 parameter's behavior may vary depending on server configuration
    or patch versions.
