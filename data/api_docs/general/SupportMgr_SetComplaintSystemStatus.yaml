documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the complaint system within the support manager.
  description: The SetComplaintSystemStatus method is used to control whether the
    complaint system is active or inactive within the TrinityCore server. This method
    allows administrators or game systems to toggle the availability of player complaints,
    which may be used for reporting issues, bugs, or inappropriate behavior. The status
    change affects how the server handles incoming complaint submissions and related
    operations. This method does not validate the input beyond its boolean nature,
    so it's expected that callers provide a meaningful status value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Complaint System
    code: SupportMgr::SetComplaintSystemStatus(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Complaint System
    code: SupportMgr::SetComplaintSystemStatus(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal flag within the SupportMgr class that
    determines whether complaint handling is enabled. It may be called during server
    maintenance or configuration changes. The method is void and does not return any
    status information, so errors in setting the status are not directly reported.
