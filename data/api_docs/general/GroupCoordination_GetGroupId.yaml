  method: GetGroupId
  signature: uint32 GroupCoordination::GetGroupId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique group identifier associated with the current group coordination
    instance.
  description: The GetGroupId method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the group
    that this GroupCoordination object is managing. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore to track and reference specific groups within the game world. The
    method is typically called when operations need to identify or validate a group,
    such as during group member management, loot distribution, or quest progression.
    It's important to note that this method should only be invoked on valid GroupCoordination
    objects that have been properly initialized with a group context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique group identifier (GUID).
    Returns 0 if the GroupCoordination object is not associated with any valid group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Group ID
    code: "GroupCoordination* coord = GetGroupCoordination();\nuint32 groupId = coord->GetGroupId();\n\
      if (groupId != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Current group ID is: %u\\n\", groupId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Group ID for Validation
    code: "GroupCoordination* coord = GetGroupCoordination();\nuint32 currentGroupId\
      \ = coord->GetGroupId();\nif (currentGroupId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with group-specific\
      \ operations\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(MAKE_NEW_GUID(currentGroupId,\
      \ 0, HIGHGUID_GROUP));\n    if (player)\n    {\n        // Perform group-related\
      \ actions\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant operation and does not modify the state of the
    GroupCoordination object. It's designed to be called frequently during group operations,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The returned
    ID corresponds directly to the group's GUID as stored in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupCoordination object is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Calling GetGroupId on an uninitialized or invalid object
    may return unexpected results or cause undefined behavior. Always validate the
    returned value against zero before using it for operations that require a valid
    group ID.
