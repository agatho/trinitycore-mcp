  signature: void Unit::DelayOwnedAuras(uint32 spellId, int caster, int32 delaytime)
documentation:
  brief: Delay owned auras for a specified spell by caster with a given delay time
  description: This method delays the application of owned auras for a specific spell
    ID, allowing control over when these effects are applied. The delay is determined
    by the caster's ID and the delay time in milliseconds. It is commonly used to
    manage spell effects that should not be immediately applied, such as delayed damage
    or buffs effects. This method is particularly useful in handling complex spell
    mechanics where timing of effects needs to be controlled.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell whose auras are being delayed. This should correspond
      to a valid spell ID in the game database.
  - name: caster
    description: The caster's ID that determines which specific aura is being delayed.
      This typically represents the source of the spell effect, such as a player or
      NPC.
  - name: delaytime
    description: The delay time in milliseconds to apply to the aura. Negative values
      indicate immediate application, while positive values delay the effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delaying a spell's aura with specific caster and delay
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit;


      // Delay owned auras for spell ID 12345 with caster ID 67890 and delay time
      of 5000ms

      target->DelayOwnedAuras(12345, 67890, 5000);

  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the timing of spell effects
    and can influence gameplay mechanics. It is typically used in conjunction with
    other methods that manage spell application or removal.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell effect application,
    potentially causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior. Use with caution
    when dealing with complex spell interactions.
