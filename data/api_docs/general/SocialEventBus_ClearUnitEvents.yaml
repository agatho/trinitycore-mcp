  class: SocialEventBus
  method: ClearUnitEvents
  signature: void SocialEventBus::ClearUnitEvents(int unitGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears all registered events for a specified unit GUID from the social event
    bus.
  description: The ClearUnitEvents method removes all pending or active social events
    associated with a given unit identifier (GUID) from the SocialEventBus. This function
    is typically used during unit destruction, logout, or when resetting social interactions
    to ensure no stale events persist in the system. The method operates on the internal
    event registry and does not directly interact with game objects or players beyond
    their GUID identifiers. It's designed to prevent memory leaks and maintain clean
    state management for social systems within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: unitGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the unit whose events should be cleared
      from the social event bus. This is typically a player or NPC GUID used to track
      social interactions and events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Events for Player
    code: SocialEventBus::instance()->ClearUnitEvents(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Events on Unit Removal
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    SocialEventBus::instance()->ClearUnitEvents(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided unitGuid is valid and corresponds to
    an existing unit in the game world. It's recommended to verify the existence of
    a unit before calling this method to avoid unintended behavior. The implementation
    likely uses internal data structures such as maps or hash tables for efficient
    lookup and removal of events.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent unitGuid may lead
    to undefined behavior if the underlying event system does not properly validate
    inputs. Ensure that all GUIDs passed are valid before invoking this function.
