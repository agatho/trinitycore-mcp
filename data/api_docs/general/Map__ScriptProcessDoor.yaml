  class: Map
  method: _ScriptProcessDoor
  signature: void Map::_ScriptProcessDoor(Object * source, Object * target, const
    ScriptInfo * scriptInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Processes door-related script events for objects in the map.
  description: The _ScriptProcessDoor method handles the execution of script actions
    associated with door interactions within a map. It is typically invoked when a
    door-related event occurs, such as a player interacting with a door or a door
    being opened/closed by another object. This method processes the provided script
    information and applies the appropriate behavior to the source and target objects
    involved in the door interaction. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    scripting system and is used internally by the game engine to manage scripted
    door behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: The object initiating the door interaction, such as a player or creature
      that triggered the door event.
  - name: target
    description: The door object being interacted with, which may be a GameObject
      representing a door.
  - name: scriptInfo
    description: Pointer to the ScriptInfo structure containing the script data and
      actions to be executed for this door interaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Door Script Processing
    code: "void HandleDoorInteraction(Player* player, GameObject* door)\n{\n    ScriptInfo\
      \ script;\n    // Assume script is populated with relevant door interaction\
      \ data\n    Map* map = player->GetMap();\n    map->_ScriptProcessDoor(player,\
      \ door, &script);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal utility function used by TrinityCore's core systems.
    It should not be called directly from external modules unless implementing custom
    door behavior logic. The method assumes valid object pointers and script data
    are provided.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid or null parameters may lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that both source and target objects are
    valid GameObjects or Units before calling this method.
