documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest reward item is useful to the player based on their
    current inventory and item usage rules.
  description: The IsRewardUseful method evaluates whether a given quest reward item
    would be beneficial or useful to the player. It considers factors such as the
    item's type, stackability, whether it's already in the player's inventory, and
    game mechanics like quest item limits and usability constraints. This method is
    typically used by the QuestManager to decide if a quest reward should be offered
    to the player or if it would be redundant. The check ensures that players don't
    receive items they cannot use or that are already present in their inventory,
    preventing unnecessary clutter and maintaining game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is considered useful (i.e., beneficial or needed)
    for the player to receive as a quest reward; returns false otherwise. A return
    value of false typically indicates that the item is either already owned by the
    player, not stackable and already at maximum quantity, or otherwise deemed redundant
    based on game rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Reward Logic
    code: "if (questManager.IsRewardUseful(itemTemplate)) {\n    // Offer item as\
      \ quest reward\n    player->AddItem(itemTemplate, 1);\n} else {\n    // Skip\
      \ offering this reward\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest reward %s is not useful\
      \ to player.\", itemTemplate->Name.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the player's current inventory,
    item limits, and quest-specific rules. It may also consider item usability flags
    and whether the item is consumable or not. The implementation might be optimized
    to avoid expensive operations by checking simple conditions first.
