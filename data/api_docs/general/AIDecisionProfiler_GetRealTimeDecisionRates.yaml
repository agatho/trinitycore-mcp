documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns real-time decision rates for AI actions performed
    by the profiler.
  description: The GetRealTimeDecisionRates method retrieves a vector of pairs containing
    decision IDs and their corresponding real-time decision rates. This method is
    typically used in AI profiling to analyze how frequently specific decisions are
    made within a given time window. The returned data allows developers to monitor
    AI behavior, identify bottlenecks, or optimize decision-making processes in game
    entities such as NPCs or creatures. It aggregates recent decision statistics from
    the internal profiler state and computes rates based on elapsed time since last
    reset or initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector of std::pair<uint32_t, double>, where each pair consists
    of a decision ID (uint32_t) and its corresponding real-time decision rate (double).
    The decision ID identifies the specific AI action or decision type, while the
    double represents how often that decision was made per unit time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\n// ... some AI decisions have been recorded\
      \ ...\nstd::vector<std::pair<uint32_t, double>> rates = profiler.GetRealTimeDecisionRates();\n\
      for (const auto& rate : rates) {\n    std::cout << \"Decision ID: \" << rate.first\
      \ << \", Rate: \" << rate.second << \"\\n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the profiler has been actively recording AI decisions.
    If no decisions have been recorded since initialization or last reset, an empty
    vector will be returned. The decision rates are calculated using internal timing
    mechanisms and may vary depending on how frequently the profiler is updated.
