  class: ConditionSourceInfo
  method: ConditionSourceInfo
  signature: void ConditionSourceInfo::ConditionSourceInfo(const Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ConditionSourceInfo object with the provided map context for
    condition evaluation.
  description: The ConditionSourceInfo constructor initializes internal state using
    the provided Map pointer. This class is used to track the source of conditions
    in the TrinityCore framework, particularly when evaluating conditional triggers
    such as quest requirements, NPC gossip options, or spell effects. The map parameter
    provides contextual information about where the condition is being evaluated,
    which can affect how certain conditions are interpreted. This initialization is
    crucial for proper condition handling within the game's scripting and trigger
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object that represents the current game world
      context for condition evaluation. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Map* currentMap = player->GetMap();

      ConditionSourceInfo sourceInfo(currentMap);

      // The sourceInfo object is now initialized with the player''s current map context'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Condition Evaluation Context
    code: "void EvaluateQuestConditions(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n \
      \   Map* map = player->GetMap();\n    ConditionSourceInfo sourceInfo(map);\n\
      \    // Use sourceInfo for condition checking against quest requirements\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore system
    when processing conditions. Developers should ensure that the Map pointer passed
    is valid and represents the correct game context. The object's internal state
    may be modified during condition evaluation, so it's important to maintain proper
    lifetime management of the Map reference.
  warnings: Passing a null map pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. Always verify that the Map pointer is valid before constructing ConditionSourceInfo
    objects. This class should not be used outside of the context of condition evaluation
    systems.
