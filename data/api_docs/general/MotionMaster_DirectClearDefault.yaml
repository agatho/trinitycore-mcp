  method: DirectClearDefault
  signature: void MotionMaster::DirectClearDefault()
documentation:
  brief: Immediately clears the default movement generator from the motion master's
    stack without scheduling any pending actions.
  description: The DirectClearDefault method removes the currently active default
    movement generator from the MotionMaster's internal stack. Unlike other clearing
    methods that may defer execution or schedule cleanup operations, this method performs
    an immediate and direct removal of the default motion state. This is typically
    used when an AI-controlled creature or player needs to abruptly stop following
    its default movement behavior, such as when switching to a different movement
    type or when resetting the motion state entirely. The operation does not trigger
    any callbacks or notifications related to motion state changes, making it suitable
    for internal cleanup scenarios where immediate action is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing default movement on a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      MotionMaster& motionMaster = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      motionMaster.DirectClearDefault();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI behavior to reset movement state
    code: "void MyAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Stop any default movement\n    me->GetMotionMaster()->DirectClearDefault();\n\
      \    \n    // Then set new movement behavior\n    me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method bypasses normal motion queue processing and directly manipulates
    the internal motion stack. It should only be used when immediate removal is required
    and when other motion generators are not actively running. The method assumes
    that no other motion operations are pending on the default generator, as it does
    not perform any cleanup or notification of pending actions.
  warnings: Using this method directly can leave the motion state in an inconsistent
    state if other motion generators depend on the default movement being present.
    It should only be called when you are certain that no other motion operations
    are relying on the default behavior, and it's recommended to pair with appropriate
    motion setting calls afterward.
