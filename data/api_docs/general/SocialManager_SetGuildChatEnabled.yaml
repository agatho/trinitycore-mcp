  class: SocialManager
  method: SetGuildChatEnabled
  signature: void SocialManager::SetGuildChatEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables guild chat functionality for the player.
  description: The SetGuildChatEnabled method controls whether a player can participate
    in guild chat channels. When enabled, the player can send and receive messages
    in guild chat; when disabled, guild chat is effectively silenced for that player.
    This setting persists across sessions and affects all guild-related communication
    including guild announcements, officer chat, and general guild channels. The method
    directly modifies the player's social settings without requiring a server restart
    or relogin.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean value indicating whether guild chat should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Guild Chat
    code: player->GetSocial()->SetGuildChatEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Guild Chat Based on Condition
    code: "if (player->GetGuildId() == 0)\n{\n    player->GetSocial()->SetGuildChatEnabled(false);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->GetSocial()->SetGuildChatEnabled(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the player's social settings internally and may trigger
    updates to the client-side UI to reflect the new guild chat state. It's recommended
    to call this method before or after guild membership changes to ensure proper
    synchronization.
