  signature: void BotScheduler::LoadPatternFromDatabase(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a bot behavior pattern from the database by name for use in scheduling
    bot actions.
  description: The LoadPatternFromDatabase method retrieves a predefined bot behavior
    pattern from the TrinityCore database using the specified pattern name. This method
    is typically used to initialize or update bot scheduling logic with stored configurations.
    The loaded pattern contains information about when and how bots should perform
    specific actions, such as movement, casting spells, or interacting with objects.
    It is commonly called during bot initialization or when switching between different
    behavioral states. The method assumes that the database contains a valid pattern
    entry matching the provided name, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior
    or missing functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier name of the pattern to load from the database.
      This should correspond to an existing pattern entry in the bot_patterns table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading a Default Bot Pattern
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadPatternFromDatabase("default_combat_pattern");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading a Custom Patrol Pattern
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadPatternFromDatabase("custom_patrol_route_1");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries and should be called during initialization
    or state transitions. It may block briefly while retrieving data from the database.
    Ensure that the pattern name exists in the database to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent pattern name may lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes. Always validate the existence of patterns before loading
    them, especially when dealing with user-defined or dynamically generated pattern
    names.
