  class: MistweaverMonkRefactored
  method: SelectHealingTarget
  signature: int * MistweaverMonkRefactored::SelectHealingTarget(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the GUID of the most suitable healing target within the
    specified group.
  description: The SelectHealingTarget method identifies and returns the appropriate
    target for healing abilities based on the current state of the Mistweaver Monk's
    group. It evaluates factors such as health percentage, proximity, and target priority
    to determine which unit should receive healing next. This method is typically
    used by AI logic to make decisions about which target to heal when multiple options
    are available. The method operates within a specified group context, ensuring
    that only valid group members are considered for healing selection.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer reference representing the group identifier or index from
      which to select a healing target. Valid values are typically non-negative integers
      corresponding to group indices in the game's internal group management system.
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the selected healing target. Returns NULL if no suitable target is found or
    if the specified group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int groupIndex = 0;\nint* targetGUID = monk.SelectHealingTarget(groupIndex);\n\
      if (targetGUID != nullptr) {\n    // Proceed with healing logic using the target\
      \ GUID\n    std::cout << \"Selected target GUID: \" << *targetGUID << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // No valid target found\n    std::cout << \"No suitable healing\
      \ target found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with error handling
    code: "int groupIndex = 1;\nint* targetGUID = monk.SelectHealingTarget(groupIndex);\n\
      if (targetGUID != nullptr && *targetGUID > 0) {\n    // Validate that the target\
      \ is still alive and within range\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*targetGUID);\n\
      \    if (target && target->IsAlive() && target->IsInWorld()) {\n        // Execute\
      \ healing spell on selected target\n        DoHeal(target);\n    }\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle case where no valid target is available\n    HandleNoTargetAvailable();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has been properly initialized and contains
    valid units. The returned GUID should be used with caution as it may become invalid
    if the unit dies or leaves the game world. Consider checking the validity of the
    returned target before performing any actions on it.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    group in the current context. Using an invalid group index can lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect targeting decisions.
