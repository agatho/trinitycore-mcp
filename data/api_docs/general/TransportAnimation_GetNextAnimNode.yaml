documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the next transport animation node based on the provided time value.
  description: The GetNextAnimNode method is used to determine the appropriate animation
    node for a transport system within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
    It takes a time parameter and returns a pointer to the next TransportAnimationEntry
    that should be active at that point in time. This method is typically used during
    transport movement calculations to ensure smooth transitions between different
    animation states. The method operates on internal transport animation data structures
    and relies on proper initialization of the transport's animation sequence. It
    is designed to handle time-based interpolation and selection of animation frames
    for moving transports like boats, zeppelins, or other vehicle-based transports.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a TransportAnimationEntry structure representing the next
    animation node in the transport's sequence. Returns nullptr if no valid animation
    node is found or if the transport animation data is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetNextAnimNode
    code: "TransportAnimation* transport = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nconst\
      \ TransportAnimationEntry* nextNode = transport->GetNextAnimNode(1000);\nif\
      \ (nextNode != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the animation node\n    printf(\"\
      Next animation node ID: %u\\n\", nextNode->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the TransportAnimation object has been properly
    initialized with animation data. The time parameter is typically expressed in
    milliseconds and should be consistent with the transport's internal timing system.
    The method may perform internal calculations to determine which animation node
    should be active at the given time, including interpolation between keyframes
    if applicable.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured TransportAnimation
    object may result in undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences. Ensure that
    the transport's animation data is valid before calling this method. The returned
    pointer is only valid while the TransportAnimation object remains in scope and
    properly initialized.
