  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const CombatAIConfig & CombatAIIntegrator::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat AI configuration settings for the integrator.
  description: The GetConfig method provides access to the immutable combat AI configuration
    that defines how the CombatAIIntegrator behaves during combat scenarios. This
    method returns a constant reference to the internal CombatAIConfig object, ensuring
    that the configuration cannot be modified through this interface. The returned
    configuration typically includes parameters such as aggression levels, spell casting
    rules, movement patterns, and other tactical behaviors that govern NPC combat
    decisions. This method is commonly used by AI systems to dynamically adjust behavior
    based on current combat conditions or player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the CombatAIConfig object containing all configuration
    parameters for the CombatAIIntegrator. The returned object should not be modified
    as it represents the immutable configuration state.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat AI Configuration
    code: "CombatAIIntegrator* aiIntegrator = ...;\nconst CombatAIConfig& config =\
      \ aiIntegrator->GetConfig();\nif (config.GetAggressionLevel() > 50)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle high aggression behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reading Configuration Values for Decision Making
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator* aiIntegrator = ...;

      const CombatAIConfig& config = aiIntegrator->GetConfig();

      uint32 maxSpellRange = config.GetMaxSpellCastRange();

      uint32 minHealthPercent = config.GetMinHealthForHealing();

      // Use these values to make tactical decisions during combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal configuration object that should
    not be modified. This method is thread-safe as it only provides read access to
    immutable data. The configuration object is typically initialized once at object
    construction and remains constant throughout the lifetime of the CombatAIIntegrator.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned CombatAIConfig reference as it will
    result in undefined behavior. Since this returns a const reference, any attempt
    to modify the configuration through this interface will cause compilation errors.
    Ensure that the CombatAIIntegrator object is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
