documentation:
  brief: Updates and manages health thresholds for the Monk AI behavior.
  description: The ManageHealthThresholds method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    the health-based decision-making logic used by the Monk AI. It evaluates the current
    health state of the monk and determines appropriate actions such as when to use
    defensive abilities, healing spells, or switching between combat strategies. This
    method typically runs during each AI update cycle to ensure that the monk's behavior
    adapts to changing health conditions in real-time. The method does not require
    any external parameters as it operates on internal AI state variables and the
    current unit's health status.

    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageHealthThresholds();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI framework during each
    update cycle. It relies on the AI's internal state tracking and should not be
    invoked manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The method may trigger
    changes in the monk's current action set based on health thresholds, which could
    affect overall combat performance.
