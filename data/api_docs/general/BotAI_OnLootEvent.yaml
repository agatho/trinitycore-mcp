documentation:
  brief: Handles loot event notifications for bot AI behavior
  description: The OnLootEvent method is invoked when a bot encounters or interacts
    with a loot event in the game world. This method processes the loot event data
    to determine appropriate bot actions such as looting items, evaluating item quality,
    or triggering specific AI behaviors based on the loot content. The method integrates
    with the bot's decision-making system to optimize inventory management and quest
    progression. It is typically called by the core game loop when a loot event occurs
    within the bot's vicinity or when the bot performs a loot-related action.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Loot Event Handling
    code: "void BotAI::OnLootEvent(const LootEvent& event) {\n    // Process the loot\
      \ event\n    if (event.type == LOOT_ITEM) {\n        ItemTemplate const* item\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(event.itemID);\n        if (item && CanEquipItem(item))\
      \ {\n            LootItem(item);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and should only be called from within
    the bot's AI context. It assumes that the loot event data is valid and properly
    initialized. The method may modify the bot's inventory and behavior state, so
    it should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Improper handling of loot events can lead to inventory corruption or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that all item checks are performed before modifying the bot's
    inventory. This method should not be called directly from outside the AI system
    without proper validation.
