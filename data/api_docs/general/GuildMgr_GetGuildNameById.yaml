  signature: int GuildMgr::GetGuildNameById(int guildId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of a guild by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetGuildNameById method fetches the name associated with a specific
    guild identifier from the game's database or in-memory storage. This function
    is typically used to resolve guild IDs into human-readable names for display purposes,
    such as in chat messages, player interfaces, or logging systems. The method operates
    on the GuildMgr singleton instance and assumes that the provided guild ID corresponds
    to an existing guild within the game world. It does not perform any validation
    of the input ID beyond checking its existence in the internal guild registry.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the guild if found; otherwise returns
    -1 to indicate that no guild exists with the specified ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Guild Name by ID
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nint result = sGuildMgr->GetGuildNameById(guildId);\n\
      if (result != -1) {\n    std::cout << \"Guild found with name: \" << result\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No guild found with ID: \" <<\
      \ guildId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or database query
    internally. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections of code
    as repeated lookups may impact server performance.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method with invalid guild IDs, as it might
    return -1 which could be misinterpreted as a valid guild name if not properly
    checked.
