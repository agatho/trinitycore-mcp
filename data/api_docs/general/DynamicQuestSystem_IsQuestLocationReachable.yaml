  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: IsQuestLocationReachable
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::IsQuestLocationReachable(Player * bot, const
    int & location)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified quest location is reachable by the player
    bot.
  description: The IsQuestLocationReachable method evaluates if a given quest location,
    identified by its unique integer identifier, is accessible to the provided player
    bot. This function likely checks for pathfinding feasibility, terrain accessibility,
    and any potential blockers or restrictions that would prevent the bot from reaching
    the location. It is commonly used in dynamic quest systems to ensure bots do not
    attempt to travel to unreachable locations, thereby improving efficiency and preventing
    errors during quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose reachability
      is being evaluated.
  - name: location
    description: Integer identifier representing the quest location. This typically
      corresponds to a specific coordinate or zone in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest location is reachable by the bot, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a quest location is reachable
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nint questLocationId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool isReachable = DynamicQuestSystem::IsQuestLocationReachable(myBot,\
      \ questLocationId);\nif (isReachable)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest action\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may internally utilize pathfinding algorithms or game state checks
    to determine accessibility. It is recommended to cache results for frequently
    checked locations to improve performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the location identifier passed is valid and corresponds to
    an actual quest location in the game world; invalid identifiers may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results.
