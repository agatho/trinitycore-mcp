  signature: bool SpellAction::IsPossible(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell action can be executed by the bot AI.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if a given spell action is currently
    feasible for execution within the context of the bot's AI. It checks various conditions
    such as spell availability, resource requirements, target validity, and game state
    constraints. This method is typically used during spell selection and decision-making
    processes to filter out invalid or impossible spell actions before attempting
    to cast them. The result helps the AI avoid wasting resources on unusable spells
    and ensures that only viable actions are considered for execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell action can be executed under current conditions,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that prerequisites
    such as mana, target availability, or spell cooldowns are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (spellAction.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with casting the spell\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(spellAction.GetSpellId());\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ action\n    ai->SelectNextAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the bot's current mana, target
    status, spell cooldowns, and other contextual factors. It may also consider the
    bot's class-specific restrictions or environmental conditions such as combat state
    or line of sight.
