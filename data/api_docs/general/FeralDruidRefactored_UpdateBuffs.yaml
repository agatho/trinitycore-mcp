  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void FeralDruidRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states for the feral druid character.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff effects on a feral druid class instance. This includes checking the
    validity of existing buffs, applying new buffs based on current game state or
    player actions, and removing expired or invalid buffs. The method typically integrates
    with the TrinityCore's combat and aura system to ensure that the druid's temporary
    stat enhancements, such as increased attack power, critical strike chance, or
    movement speed, are accurately reflected in the character's current state. It
    may also handle interactions between different buffs, such as stacking rules or
    mutual exclusivity, ensuring proper gameplay balance and adherence to World of
    Warcraft class mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Trigger for Buff Refresh
    code: "void FeralDruidRefactored::OnShapeshift()\n{\n    // Reapply buffs after\
      \ shapeshifting\n    UpdateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate buff states. It may internally query the player's current aura stack
    and apply necessary modifications to their stats. The implementation likely interacts
    with TrinityCore's Aura system and may involve recalculating combat statistics
    such as attack power, armor penetration, or spell damage bonuses.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    performance degradation in high-frequency AI update loops. Ensure that buff updates
    are only triggered when necessary to avoid redundant processing of unchanged states.
