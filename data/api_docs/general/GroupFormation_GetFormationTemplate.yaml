    type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation template associated with the group formation.
  description: The GetFormationTemplate method returns the FormationTemplate object
    that defines the positioning and behavior of units within a group formation. This
    template contains configuration data such as formation type, spacing, and positioning
    rules used by the group during combat or movement. The method is typically called
    when initializing or updating group formations to ensure consistent behavior across
    all members of the group. It does not modify any internal state but provides read-only
    access to the formation's structural definition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FormationTemplate object containing the configuration data for the group
    formation, including positioning rules and behavior parameters. Returns an empty
    or default template if no valid formation is associated with the group.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Formation Template
    code: "FormationTemplate template = groupFormation.GetFormationTemplate();\nif\
      \ (template.IsValid()) {\n    // Use template data for group positioning\n \
      \   LOG_DEBUG(\"group\", \"Formation type: {}\", template.GetFormationType());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. It performs
    no heavy computations and returns a cached template reference, making it efficient
    for repeated calls during group updates or combat scenarios.
