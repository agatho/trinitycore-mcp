  method: GetSecondsRemaining
  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::GetSecondsRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of seconds remaining until the black market
    auction entry expires.
  description: The GetSecondsRemaining method computes the time difference between
    the current server time and the expiration time of a black market auction entry.
    This value represents how many seconds are left before the auction ends and the
    item is no longer available for bidding. The method performs a simple time calculation
    using internal timestamps stored within the BlackMarketEntry object. It's commonly
    used in UI updates to display countdown timers and in game logic to determine
    when auctions should be removed or processed. The returned value will be negative
    if the auction has already expired, though this typically shouldn't occur during
    normal operation as expired entries are usually cleaned up.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of seconds remaining until the black
    market auction expires. A positive value indicates time left, zero means immediate
    expiration, and a negative value indicates that the auction has already expired.
  examples:
  - title: Display time remaining for a black market item
    code: "void DisplayBMItemTimeRemaining(BlackMarketEntry* entry)\n{\n    int seconds\
      \ = entry->GetSecondsRemaining();\n    if (seconds > 0)\n        printf(\"Time\
      \ remaining: %d seconds\\n\", seconds);\n    else\n        printf(\"Auction\
      \ has expired\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update UI countdown timer for black market auction
    code: "void UpdateBlackMarketTimer(BlackMarketEntry* entry, uint32& timeLeftSeconds)\n\
      {\n    timeLeftSeconds = static_cast<uint32>(entry->GetSecondsRemaining());\n\
      \    if (timeLeftSeconds == 0)\n    {\n        // Handle auction expiration\
      \ logic\n        entry->HandleAuctionExpired();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal timestamp data of the BlackMarketEntry
    object, which should be properly initialized when the auction is created. The
    calculation assumes that server time is consistent and synchronized across all
    game systems. Performance impact is minimal as it only performs a subtraction
    operation between two timestamps.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns negative values for expired auctions,
    which may not be handled properly in all code paths. Always validate return values
    before using them in time-sensitive operations or UI updates to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
