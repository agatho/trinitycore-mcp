documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot lifecycle manager, terminating all active bot processes
    and cleaning up associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all running
    bot instances managed by the BotLifecycleMgr. This method ensures that all active
    bots are properly closed, their memory is freed, and any ongoing operations are
    safely concluded before the system shuts down. It typically gets invoked during
    server shutdown or when the bot manager needs to be reset. The method does not
    accept any parameters and performs no return value operations, making it a simple
    but critical cleanup function for maintaining system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->Shutdown();

  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a safe state to terminate
    all bot processes. Calling it during active gameplay or while bots are performing
    critical tasks may result in data loss or unexpected behavior.
