documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the GroupDisbandedHandler class for identification purposes.
  description: The GetHandlerName method is a const member function of the GroupDisbandedHandler
    class that returns a std::string containing the name of this handler. This method
    is typically used in TrinityCore's packet handling system to identify and log
    which handler is processing a particular group disbanded message. The returned
    string serves as a unique identifier for the handler within the system, allowing
    developers to track and debug packet processing flows. This method does not modify
    any internal state of the object and is thread-safe as it only reads constant
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the name of the GroupDisbandedHandler class, typically
    'GroupDisbandedHandler'.
  examples:

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's packet handler infrastructure and is
    commonly used in logging and debugging scenarios to identify which handler is
    responsible for processing a specific network packet. The implementation typically
    returns a hardcoded string value representing the class name.
