  signature: void Player::SetBaseModFlatValue(int modGroup, float val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a flat modifier value for a specific base mod group in the player's
    statistics.
  description: This method allows developers to set a flat modifier value for a specified
    base mod group, which affects various player statistics such as attack power,
    critical strike chance, or other game mechanics. The method is typically used
    during character creation, level-up, or when applying buffs/debuffs to modify
    player attributes. It directly modifies the player's base stats and can influence
    combat performance, spell casting, and overall gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: modGroup
    description: The base mod group identifier that determines which statistic will
      be modified. Valid values include various stat types such as attack power, critical
      strike chance, or other base modifiers.
  - name: val
    description: The flat value to be set for the specified base mod group. This can
      be positive or negative and affects the player's overall statistics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a flat attack power modifier
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetBaseModFlatValue(BASEMOD_ATTACK_POWER, 100.0f);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a critical strike chance modifier
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during character initialization or when
    modifying player stats during gameplay. It's important to understand that this
    method directly modifies the base stat values and may affect combat performance,
    spell casting, and overall game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay or incorrect
    statistics. Care must be taken when setting negative values as they may cause
    unexpected behavior in player stats.
