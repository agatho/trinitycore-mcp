  method: RemoveFromObjectUpdate
  signature: void Item::RemoveFromObjectUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the item from the object update list, preventing it from being updated
    in the world.
  description: This method removes an Item from the ObjectUpdate list, which is used
    by the TrinityCore server to manage objects that need to be sent updates to players.
    When this method is called, the item will no longer be included in the update
    packets sent to players, effectively removing it from the visible world state.
    This is typically used when an item is being destroyed, moved to a different inventory,
    or when it needs to be temporarily hidden from players. The method ensures that
    the item's position in the object update list is properly removed, preventing
    potential issues with stale data updates.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->RemoveFromObjectUpdate();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when an item is no longer needed in the world
    update list, such as during item destruction or when moving items between inventories.
    It's important to note that this method does not actually delete the item from
    memory; it only removes it from the update list.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may lead to inconsistent state
    updates in the game world. Ensure that this method is called only when appropriate,
    such as when an item is being removed from the player's inventory or when it's
    no longer visible to players.
