documentation:
  brief: Handles game event activation or deactivation for the AI unit
  description: 'The OnGameEvent method is called by the TrinityCore framework when
    a game event is triggered or deactivated. This method allows UnitAI implementations
    to respond to various in-game events such as holidays, seasonal changes, or custom
    server events. The method receives two parameters: a boolean indicating whether
    the event is being activated (true) or deactivated (false), and a uint16 representing
    the event ID. This callback mechanism enables AI units to modify their behavior,
    appearance, or actions based on active game events.'
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the game event is being activated (true)
      or deactivated (false)
  - name: param1
    description: uint16 identifier representing the specific game event that was triggered
  returns: null

    code: "class MyAI : public UnitAI {\npublic:\n    void OnGameEvent(bool activated,\
      \ uint16 eventId) override {\n        if (eventId == 1234 && activated) {\n\
      \            // Activate special behavior for event 1234\n            SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        } else if (eventId == 1234 && !activated) {\n            // Deactivate\
      \ special behavior\n            SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n        }\n \
      \   }\n};"

  - title: Event-Based Visual Modification
    code: "void MyAI::OnGameEvent(bool activated, uint16 eventId) {\n    switch (eventId)\
      \ {\n        case 5678: // Halloween event\n            if (activated) {\n \
      \               SetDisplayId(12345); // Change to ghost appearance\n       \
      \     } else {\n                SetDisplayId(12346); // Restore normal appearance\n\
      \            }\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is invoked from the game event system and should not be called
    directly. The AI implementation must handle both activation and deactivation cases
    properly to ensure consistent behavior. Event IDs are typically defined in the
    game_event table of the database.
  warnings: Improper handling of event deactivation may lead to persistent visual
    or behavioral changes. Ensure that all temporary modifications made during event
    activation are properly reverted when the event is deactivated.
