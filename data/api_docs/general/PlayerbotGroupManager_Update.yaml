  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: Update
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player bot group manager's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining and synchronizing
    the state of player bot groups within the TrinityCore framework. It processes
    various game events, checks for group changes, and ensures that bot behavior remains
    consistent with the current group dynamics. This method is typically called from
    the main game loop at regular intervals to handle time-based updates such as AI
    decision making, group coordination, and synchronization of bot actions. The implementation
    likely handles tasks like checking if players have left or joined groups, updating
    group loot settings, managing bot roles, and ensuring proper communication between
    bots in a group.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    playerbotGroupManager->Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Other update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently from the game's main update
    loop. It should not block or perform heavy operations as it's part of the core
    game tick. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since last update, which
    is used for time-based calculations and smooth AI behavior.
