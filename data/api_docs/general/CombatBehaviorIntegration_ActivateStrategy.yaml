  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: ActivateStrategy
  signature: void CombatBehaviorIntegration::ActivateStrategy(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a combat strategy based on the provided flags for the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    class.
  description: The ActivateStrategy method initializes or enables a specific combat
    behavior strategy within the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. This method likely
    configures internal state or applies settings that determine how an AI-controlled
    unit will behave during combat encounters. The 'flags' parameter is used to specify
    which strategy or combination of strategies should be activated, allowing for
    flexible and dynamic combat behavior customization. This method is typically called
    when a combat situation begins or when specific conditions are met that require
    a change in tactical approach.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask value that specifies which combat strategy or strategies
      to activate. Each bit in the flag represents a different combat behavior option,
      allowing for combination of multiple strategies through bitwise operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Activation
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration behavior;

      behavior.ActivateStrategy(FLAG_MELEE_COMBAT | FLAG_FLEE_WHEN_LOW_HEALTH);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Multi-Strategy Activation
    code: 'uint32 strategyFlags = FLAG_RANGED_COMBAT | FLAG_CAST_SPELLS | FLAG_TANKING;

      CombatBehaviorIntegration behavior;

      behavior.ActivateStrategy(strategyFlags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables and may trigger callbacks
    or event notifications within the AI system. The exact implementation details
    depend on how the CombatBehaviorIntegration class manages its strategy states
    and how the flags are interpreted.
