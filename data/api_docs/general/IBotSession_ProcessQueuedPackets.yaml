  class: IBotSession
  method: ProcessQueuedPackets
  signature: void IBotSession::ProcessQueuedPackets()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all queued network packets for the bot session.
  description: The ProcessQueuedPackets method handles the dispatching and execution
    of all network messages that have been accumulated in the session's packet queue.
    This method is typically invoked during the bot's update cycle to ensure timely
    processing of incoming data from the game server, such as player movements, chat
    messages, or world state updates. It ensures that the bot remains synchronized
    with the game world by handling these packets in the correct order and applying
    appropriate logic for each message type. The method operates synchronously and
    may block until all queued packets are processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot update loop
    code: "void Bot::Update()\n{\n    // ... other bot logic ...\n    session->ProcessQueuedPackets();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other operations ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the bot's update loop to prevent
    packet queue buildup. It is not thread-safe and must be invoked from the same
    thread context where the session was initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling may lead
    to performance degradation due to excessive processing of low-priority packets.
    Ensure that packet handling logic inside does not introduce blocking operations.
