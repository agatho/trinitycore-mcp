  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: CalculateAssistPriority
  signature: float TargetAssistAction::CalculateAssistPriority(Player * bot, Unit
    * target, Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the assist priority value for a target based on bot,
    target, and group data.
  description: The CalculateAssistPriority method determines how strongly a bot should
    prioritize assisting a specific target within a group context. It evaluates various
    factors such as the target's threat level, distance, health, and the bot's role
    in the group to compute a priority score. This value is used by the AI system
    to decide which targets to focus on for assistance during combat. The method is
    typically invoked when determining the optimal target for a bot to assist with,
    ensuring that the most critical or beneficial targets are prioritized based on
    group dynamics and combat strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is calculating
      assist priority. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target for which assist
      priority is being calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group context in which
      the assist priority is calculated. May be null if no group context exists.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated assist priority for the target.
    Higher values indicate higher priority for assisting the target. Values are typically
    between 0.0 (lowest priority) and 1.0 (highest priority), though exact ranges
    may vary based on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "float priority = assistAction.CalculateAssistPriority(bot, target, group);\n\
      if (priority > 0.7f) {\n    // Bot should prioritize assisting this target\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Priority to Select Target
    code: "float bestPriority = 0.0f;\nUnit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfor (auto& target\
      \ : targets) {\n    float priority = assistAction.CalculateAssistPriority(bot,\
      \ target, group);\n    if (priority > bestPriority) {\n        bestPriority\
      \ = priority;\n        bestTarget = target;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestTarget for\
      \ assist action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making system in TrinityCore and is
    intended to be used within group-based combat scenarios. The priority calculation
    may depend on bot class, role (tank, healer, damage dealer), target type, and
    other contextual factors. Performance is generally acceptable for real-time AI
    calculations but should be considered when processing large numbers of targets.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are valid pointers before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes the bot and
    target are in the same map and world context, otherwise results may be inaccurate
    or misleading.
