  signature: BotAIDecisionProfile AIDecisionProfiler::GetBotProfile(uint32_t botGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the AI decision profile associated with a specific bot GUID.
  description: The GetBotProfile method fetches the BotAIDecisionProfile object that
    defines how a particular bot, identified by its unique GUID, should make AI-driven
    decisions. This includes behavior patterns, priorities, and decision-making rules
    tailored for that specific bot instance. The method is typically used in the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system to customize NPC or player-controlled bot behaviors
    dynamically during runtime. It assumes that a valid bot with the specified GUID
    exists within the system and returns an appropriate profile structure if found.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIDecisionProfile object containing all AI decision-making parameters
    for the specified bot. If no bot is found with the given GUID, the behavior is
    undefined and may result in a default or invalid profile being returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve AI Profile for a Specific Bot
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile = profiler.GetBotProfile(botGuid);

      // Use profile to access bot''s decision-making rules

      std::cout << "Bot priority: " << profile.priority << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal data structures such as
    maps or hash tables for fast lookup by GUID. Ensure that the provided botGuid
    corresponds to an active and registered bot in the system to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered bot GUID may lead
    to memory corruption or access violations depending on implementation details.
    Always validate the existence of a bot before calling this method.
