  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: AdaptQuestDifficulty
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::AdaptQuestDifficulty(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the difficulty of a quest for a specific player based on dynamic
    system rules.
  description: The AdaptQuestDifficulty method modifies the difficulty level of a
    given quest for a specified player, ensuring that the quest remains appropriately
    challenging based on the player's current level and other dynamic factors within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used in automated quest systems
    or botting frameworks to maintain game balance and realism when quests are dynamically
    assigned or modified. The adjustment process may involve recalculating quest rewards,
    experience values, and objective requirements to match the player's capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be adjusted in difficulty.
      Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the quest difficulty is being
      adapted. This player must be valid and connected to the server.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      Player* player = ...; // Assume a valid player pointer

      questSystem.AdaptQuestDifficulty(12345, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Quest Logic
    code: "void ApplyDynamicDifficulty(uint32 questId, Player* player)\n{\n    if\
      \ (player && player->IsInWorld())\n    {\n        DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;\n\
      \        questSystem.AdaptQuestDifficulty(questId, player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal dynamic quest logic and may modify quest data
    in memory. It should only be called after verifying that the quest exists and
    the player is valid. The implementation assumes that the player's level and other
    relevant attributes are properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or null player pointer will
    likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all preconditions are met
    before invoking this function.
