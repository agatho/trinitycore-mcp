  class: FormationMovementGenerator
  method: DoReset
  signature: void FormationMovementGenerator::DoReset(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the formation movement generator's state for a creature.
  description: The DoReset method initializes or reinitializes the formation movement
    behavior for a creature, typically called when the movement generator is activated
    or needs to restart its formation logic. This method ensures that the creature's
    movement follows the defined formation pattern relative to its leader. It may
    reset internal counters, clear previous movement data, and prepare the generator
    for new movement instructions. The method is part of the AI system in TrinityCore
    and is used in conjunction with formation-based creature behaviors such as those
    seen in groups of mobs following a designated leader.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object whose formation movement state will
      be reset. This parameter must not be null for the method to function correctly.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Formation Movement for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...; // Assume creature is initialized

      FormationMovementGenerator movementGen;

      movementGen.DoReset(creature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when a creature's
    movement generator is activated or reactivated. Developers should ensure that
    the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and not null, as passing an
    invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling DoReset with a null Creature pointer will likely result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always validate the input parameter before invoking this
    method.
