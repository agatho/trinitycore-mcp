  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: UnitSpeedChanged
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::UnitSpeedChanged()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement generator when the unit's speed changes.
  description: The UnitSpeedChanged method is called when a unit's movement speed
    is modified, typically during gameplay events such as running, walking, or being
    affected by spells that alter speed. This method ensures that any follow movement
    behavior is adjusted accordingly to maintain proper tracking of the target unit.
    It is part of the movement generator system in TrinityCore and integrates with
    the AI framework to handle dynamic speed changes in pursuit or following behaviors.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_followGenerator)\n \
      \       m_followGenerator->UnitSpeedChanged();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core movement system when
    speed changes occur, and should not be called directly unless implementing custom
    movement logic. The implementation may adjust pathfinding calculations or update
    internal timers based on new speed values.
