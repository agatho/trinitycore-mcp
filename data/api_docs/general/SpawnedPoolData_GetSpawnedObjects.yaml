  class: SpawnedPoolData
  method: GetSpawnedObjects
  signature: uint32 SpawnedPoolData::GetSpawnedObjects(uint32 pool_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of spawned objects within a specified pool.
  description: The GetSpawnedObjects method returns the number of active game objects
    that have been spawned as part of a specific pool. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    dynamic spawning system where pools manage groups of game objects such as creatures,
    game objects, or quest items. The method allows scripts and systems to query how
    many objects from a given pool are currently active in the world. It does not
    perform any spawning or despooling operations; it simply reports the current state
    of the pool's spawned objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of spawned objects currently active
    within the pool. Returns zero if no objects are spawned or if the pool ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check Spawned Object Count in a Pool
    code: "uint32 spawnedCount = spawnedPoolData.GetSpawnedObjects(12345);\nif (spawnedCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with logic that depends on active objects\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Pool 12345 has %u spawned objects.\", spawnedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with pool management systems
    to monitor or control dynamic object spawning. It's important to note that the
    returned count reflects only those objects currently active in the world, not
    the total possible members of the pool. The method is thread-safe as it reads
    from a cached or synchronized pool state.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided pool_id is valid and corresponds to an existing
    pool; otherwise, the behavior may be undefined or return zero. This method should
    not be used for spawning new objects, only for querying current states.
