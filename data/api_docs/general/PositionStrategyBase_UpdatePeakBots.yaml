  method: UpdatePeakBots
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::UpdatePeakBots(uint32 botCount)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the peak bot count for the position strategy.
  description: The UpdatePeakBots method is responsible for tracking and updating
    the maximum number of bots that have been active within a given position strategy
    context. This method is typically invoked when bot activity changes, such as when
    bots are added or removed from a specific area or zone. It helps maintain internal
    statistics and may influence AI behavior decisions based on historical peak activity
    levels. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state variables
    related to peak bot counts.
  parameters:
  - name: botCount
    description: The current number of active bots to update the peak count with.
      This value is compared against the existing peak value and updated if it's higher.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Peak Bot Count
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase* strategy = new PositionStrategyBase();

      strategy->UpdatePeakBots(15); // Sets peak bots to 15

      strategy->UpdatePeakBots(20); // Updates peak bots to 20 since 20 > 15'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in AI systems where tracking historical activity
    levels is important for decision-making. It may be called frequently during bot
    lifecycle events, and performance should be considered if used in tight loops.
