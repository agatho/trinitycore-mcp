  method: UpdateCooldownStates
  signature: void FireMageRefactored::UpdateCooldownStates()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all fire spell abilities of the mage.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method manages and refreshes the internal
    cooldown tracking for all fire-based spells available to the FireMageRefactored
    class. This method is typically invoked during each game tick or when a spell
    is cast to ensure that cooldown timers are properly updated and that the mage
    can accurately determine which abilities are currently available for use. It handles
    the decrementing of active cooldowns, resetting cooldowns upon spell casting,
    and ensuring that the mage's ability to cast spells aligns with game mechanics
    such as spell cooldowns, mana costs, and class-specific abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop() {\n    FireMageRefactored mage;\n    // ... initialization\
      \ code ...\n    mage.UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // ... continue with game\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: "void CastFireball() {\n    FireMageRefactored mage;\n    if (mage.IsSpellReady(FIREBALL))\
      \ {\n        // Cast spell\n        mage.CastSpell(FIREBALL);\n        // Update\
      \ cooldowns after casting\n        mage.UpdateCooldownStates();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called in the game's main update loop or immediately
    following a spell cast. It assumes that all relevant cooldown timers are initialized
    and managed by internal state tracking. Developers should ensure that this method
    is not called too frequently to avoid unnecessary performance overhead, especially
    in high-frequency game loops.
  warnings: Improper handling of cooldown states can lead to spells appearing available
    when they are actually on cooldown or vice versa, resulting in incorrect gameplay
    behavior. Ensure all spell cooldowns are correctly initialized and updated before
    calling this method.
