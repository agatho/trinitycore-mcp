  class: SmoothPhasing
  method: DisableReplacementForSeer
  signature: void SmoothPhasing::DisableReplacementForSeer(ObjectGuid seer)
documentation:
  brief: Disables phasing replacement behavior for a specific seer object.
  description: The DisableReplacementForSeer method prevents the SmoothPhasing system
    from replacing the phase of the specified seer object. This is typically used
    to maintain a consistent phase state for certain objects, such as players or creatures,
    when other phasing operations might otherwise override their current phase. The
    method operates on the ObjectGuid of the seer and modifies internal tracking within
    the SmoothPhasing subsystem to exclude this specific object from automatic phase
    replacement logic.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The ObjectGuid of the seer object for which phasing replacement should
      be disabled. This parameter identifies the specific object whose phase state
      will not be modified by automatic replacement mechanisms.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable phase replacement for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      SmoothPhasing::DisableReplacementForSeer(player->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable phase replacement for a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...; // Get creature reference

      SmoothPhasing::DisableReplacementForSeer(creature->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmoothPhasing system which manages phase transitions
    in World of Warcraft environments. It's important to understand that disabling
    replacement does not prevent all phase changes, only those initiated by the automatic
    replacement logic. The method should be called before any phase modifications
    are expected to occur for the seer object.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or non-existent ObjectGuid may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the seer object is valid and exists
    in the current world context before calling this method. Improper use can result
    in inconsistent phasing states across the game world.
