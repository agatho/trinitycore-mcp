documentation:
  brief: Checks if there are any active objects near a specified grid in the map.
  description: The ActiveObjectsNearGrid method determines whether there are any active
    game objects (such as players, creatures, or game entities) currently located
    within or near the specified grid cell. This method is typically used for optimization
    purposes to avoid processing grids that do not contain active entities, thereby
    reducing unnecessary computations in the game world. The method takes a grid identifier
    and returns true if at least one active object exists in or adjacent to that grid,
    false otherwise. It's commonly used in map management and object visibility systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are active objects near the specified grid; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Active Objects Near Grid
    code: "if (map->ActiveObjectsNearGrid(10)) {\n    // Process grid 10 since it\
      \ has active objects\n    std::cout << \"Grid 10 contains active objects.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Skip processing grid 10\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Grid 10 is empty.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal spatial partitioning data structures to
    efficiently determine object presence. It may be called during map loading, unloading,
    or visibility updates to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary processing
    of empty grids.
