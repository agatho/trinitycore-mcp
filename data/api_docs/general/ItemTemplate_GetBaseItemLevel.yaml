  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetBaseItemLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the base item level value associated with this item template.
  description: The GetBaseItemLevel method returns the base item level of an ItemTemplate
    object, which represents the fundamental level requirement for an item as defined
    in the game database. This value is used during item creation and scaling processes
    to determine the minimum level at which a player can use the item. The base item
    level does not account for any enchantments, gems, or other modifiers that may
    increase the effective item level of an equipped item. It serves as a baseline
    for item progression systems and is crucial for proper item balancing in World
    of Warcraft's leveling and loot systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the base item level of the item template. This
    value typically corresponds to the minimum player level required to equip the
    item, or serves as a reference point for item scaling calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 baseLevel = itemTemplate->GetBaseItemLevel();

      printf("Base Item Level: %u\n", baseLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Item Level Against Player Level
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\n\
      uint32 baseLevel = itemTemplate->GetBaseItemLevel();\nif (player->getLevel()\
      \ >= baseLevel)\n{\n    // Player can equip the item\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player\
      \ cannot equip the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached value from the ItemTemplate structure, making
    it a fast operation. The base item level is typically loaded from the 'item_template'
    database table and is immutable after initialization. This value may be overridden
    by certain item modifications or special item effects in some cases.
  warnings: Be aware that this value represents only the base level requirement and
    does not reflect any temporary increases due to enchantments, gems, or other modifiers.
    When comparing against player levels for equipment validation, consider using
    effective item level calculations instead of just the base level.
