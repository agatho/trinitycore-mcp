  signature: void GuardianDruidRefactored::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the guardian druid's rotation logic based on current target and combat
    state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate spell casting sequence for a Guardian Druid AI. This method evaluates
    the current target's status, available mana, and combat conditions to decide which
    abilities should be cast next in the rotation. It typically handles priority-based
    spell selection, cooldown management, and resource optimization to maximize damage
    output or survivability depending on the configured playstyle. The method is called
    regularly during combat to ensure optimal decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that the guardian druid should focus its
      rotation on. This parameter allows the AI to dynamically adjust its behavior
      based on the current target's health, status effects, and threat level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void GuardianDruidRefactored::UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target <= 0) return;\n    // Logic to determine next spell based on target\
      \ and current state\n    // Implementation details would go here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop at regular
    intervals. It should not be invoked directly during combat without proper checks
    for valid targets and player state. The method assumes that all necessary combat
    state information is already available through other class members or global game
    state variables.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit before dereferencing
    it. This method may cause performance issues if not optimized properly, especially
    in high-frequency combat scenarios.
