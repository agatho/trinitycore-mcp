documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for chase behavior
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique integer identifier
    associated with the ChaseMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore's movement system to distinguish different types of movement generators
    and route appropriate AI behaviors. The method is typically called during movement
    processing to determine how an object should move in relation to its target, particularly
    in combat scenarios where creatures pursue players or other units. It serves as
    part of the broader movement generator pattern implementation that governs NPC
    behavior in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type constant for chase
    behavior. This value is typically a predefined enum or constant defined within
    the MovementGeneratorType enumeration, commonly used to identify this specific
    movement behavior in the AI system.
  examples:
  - title: Checking movement generator type
    code: "ChaseMovementGenerator* chaseGen = new ChaseMovementGenerator();\nint type\
      \ = chaseGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\nif (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_CHASE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle chase movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure virtual function implementation in the base MovementGenerator
    class, and should always return a consistent value for the ChaseMovementGenerator
    type. The returned integer is typically used in switch statements or comparisons
    within the AI subsystem to determine how to process movement requests.
