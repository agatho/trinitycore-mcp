documentation:
  brief: Moves an AuctionHouseBot instance to a new location using move semantics.
  description: The AuctionHouseBot constructor that accepts an rvalue reference to
    another AuctionHouseBot instance. This move constructor transfers all resources
    and state from the source object to the current object, leaving the source in
    a valid but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's AuctionHouseBot
    system, this allows for efficient resource management when creating new auction
    house bot instances from temporary or existing ones. The method is typically used
    internally by the game engine during object creation and management operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an AuctionHouseBot
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot bot1;

      // ... initialize bot1 ...

      AuctionHouseBot bot2 = std::move(bot1); // Move constructor invoked'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed to be efficient
    by transferring ownership of resources rather than copying them. The source object
    becomes invalid after the move operation and should not be used.
  warnings: Using this constructor on an already moved-from object results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that objects are only moved from once, and never used afterward.
