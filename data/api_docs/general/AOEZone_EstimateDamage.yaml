documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the estimated damage output of an area of effect zone
    over a specified time period.
  description: The EstimateDamage method computes the projected total damage that
    will be inflicted by an area of effect (AOE) zone over a given time interval.
    This estimation takes into account various factors such as the duration of the
    zone, the damage per second (DPS), and any applicable modifiers or multipliers.
    It is commonly used in game mechanics to determine the impact of AOE spells or
    traps before they fully activate or when calculating potential threat or damage
    for AI decision-making. The method does not modify any internal state and is purely
    a predictive calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the estimated total damage output during
    the specified time period in the zone. Returns zero if the zone has no damage
    or if the time parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AOEZone zone;

      float estimatedDamage = zone.EstimateDamage(5000); // Estimate damage over 5
      seconds

      printf("Estimated Damage: %.2f\n", estimatedDamage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Effects
    code: 'SpellInfo* spell = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      AOEZone* aoeZone = new AOEZone(spell);

      uint32 timeInZone = 3000; // 3 seconds

      float damageEstimate = aoeZone->EstimateDamage(timeInZone);

      // Use damageEstimate for threat calculation or UI display

      printf("Spell %u will deal approximately %.1f damage\n", spell->Id, damageEstimate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AOE zone is active and fully functional. It
    does not account for dynamic changes in damage over time or external factors like
    diminishing returns or target resistance unless those are baked into the internal
    zone state. The accuracy of the estimation depends on the correctness of the zone's
    configuration parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the AOEZone object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid zone may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. Do not rely solely on estimated values for critical
    gameplay decisions without validation.
