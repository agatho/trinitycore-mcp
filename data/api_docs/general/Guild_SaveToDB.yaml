documentation:
  brief: Saves the guild's data to the database, persisting all changes made to the
    guild object.
  description: The SaveToDB method is responsible for writing all current guild data
    to the TrinityCore database. This includes information such as guild name, leader
    GUID, guild permissions, member list, and any other mutable guild properties that
    have been modified since the last save. The method ensures data consistency by
    performing a complete write operation to the relevant database tables. It is typically
    called automatically when guild modifications occur or manually during specific
    maintenance operations. This method does not return any value but may trigger
    database transactions that could affect performance if called frequently.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n \
      \   myGuild->SaveToDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Saving After Modifications
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildByName(\"Test Guild\");\nif (guild)\n\
      {\n    // Modify guild data\n    guild->SetMOTD(\"Welcome to our new guild!\"\
      );\n    \n    // Save changes to database\n    guild->SaveToDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a synchronous database write operation which may block
    execution until the transaction completes. It should not be called in performance-critical
    sections of code where frequent database access is required. The method internally
    handles all necessary SQL operations and does not require manual transaction management.
  warnings: Calling SaveToDB() too frequently can cause performance degradation due
    to database I/O overhead. Avoid calling it within tight loops or high-frequency
    event handlers. Also, ensure that the guild object is valid before calling this
    method to prevent potential crashes.
