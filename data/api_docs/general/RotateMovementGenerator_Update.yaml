  class: RotateMovementGenerator
  method: Update
  signature: bool RotateMovementGenerator::Update(int * param0, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the rotation movement generator to control entity orientation during
    movement.
  description: The Update method of RotateMovementGenerator is responsible for managing
    and updating the rotational state of a moving entity within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles the logic required to rotate an object smoothly
    towards a target direction or maintain a specific orientation while moving. It
    integrates with the game's AI and movement systems to ensure proper entity facing
    during pathfinding and locomotion behaviors. The method returns true if the rotation
    update was successful and the entity's orientation is still valid, or false if
    the rotation process has completed or failed.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may represent a target angle,
      rotation speed, or state flag. Value constraints depend on implementation context.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer parameter that likely defines the update duration, rotation
      type, or movement phase. Valid values vary based on usage within the movement
      generator system.
  returns: Returns true if the rotation update was successful and the entity's orientation
    is still valid; returns false if the rotation process has completed or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "bool success = rotationGenerator.Update(&targetAngle, 100);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Continue updating rotation\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Rotation complete or\
      \ error occurred\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement System
    code: "void UpdatePlayerRotation(Player* player, float targetFacing)\n{\n    RotateMovementGenerator*\
      \ rotGen = new RotateMovementGenerator();\n    int angle = static_cast<int>(targetFacing\
      \ * 100);\n    if (!rotGen->Update(&angle, 50))\n    {\n        // Handle rotation\
      \ completion\n        player->SetFacing(targetFacing);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator subsystem in TrinityCore and
    should be called regularly during entity updates. The parameters may vary depending
    on the specific subclass or usage context of RotateMovementGenerator. Ensure that
    the target angle and update duration values are within acceptable ranges to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can cause erratic rotation behavior or complete
    failure of the movement generator. Always validate input parameters before calling
    this method, especially when dealing with dynamic angles or time-based updates.
