  method: AdjustQuestObjectiveProgress
  signature: void Player::AdjustQuestObjectiveProgress(const Quest * quest)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the progress of quest objectives for the player based on the provided
    quest data.
  description: The AdjustQuestObjectiveProgress method updates the player's quest
    progress by evaluating and modifying the state of quest objectives associated
    with a specific quest. This method is typically invoked when a player interacts
    with quest-related game elements such as killing mobs, collecting items, or completing
    objectives. It ensures that the player's quest log accurately reflects their current
    progress toward completing the specified quest. The method internally handles
    updates to objective counters, checks for quest completion conditions, and may
    trigger related events or notifications. This function is part of the core quest
    management system in TrinityCore and is essential for maintaining synchronization
    between player actions and quest states.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nconst Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (quest)\n{\n    player->AdjustQuestObjectiveProgress(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player's quest state needs to
    be updated, typically after completing an objective or interacting with quest-related
    NPCs. It is not intended for direct use in performance-critical code paths due
    to its potential to trigger multiple internal updates and database writes.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid quest parameter may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the quest exists before calling this method.
    Additionally, modifying quest progress outside of normal gameplay flow can cause
    inconsistencies in the player's quest log.
