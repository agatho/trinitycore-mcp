  signature: int ZonePlacement::GetPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current position identifier for the zone placement object
  description: The GetPosition method returns an integer identifier representing the
    current position within a zone placement context. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine the specific location
    or slot assigned to an object or entity within a defined zone. The returned value
    often corresponds to a predefined position index that may be used for spatial
    reasoning, object placement, or zone-specific logic execution. The method performs
    no side effects and simply retrieves the stored position value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current position identifier within the zone
    placement context. This value typically corresponds to an index or slot number
    that defines where the object is positioned in relation to other objects or boundaries
    within the zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Retrieval
    code: "ZonePlacement* placement = player->GetZonePlacement();\nint position =\
      \ placement->GetPosition();\nif (position >= 0) {\n    // Use the position value\
      \ for further logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Current position: %d\", position);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state. The returned
    integer value should be validated against expected ranges before use in conditional
    logic. In some implementations, negative values might indicate invalid or uninitialized
    positions.
  warnings: Ensure that the ZonePlacement object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized object may result in undefined behavior.
    The position value should not be used directly for spatial calculations without
    proper validation.
