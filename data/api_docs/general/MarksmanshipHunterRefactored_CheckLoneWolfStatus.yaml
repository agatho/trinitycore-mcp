  brief: Checks and updates the Lone Wolf talent status for the marksmanship hunter.
  description: The CheckLoneWolfStatus method evaluates whether the hunter currently
    meets the conditions to activate the Lone Wolf talent effect. This talent typically
    provides benefits such as increased damage or movement speed when the hunter is
    alone in a group. The method likely checks the number of party members or nearby
    allies and adjusts the hunter's stats or aura accordingly. It may be called during
    combat state changes, player entry into groups, or at regular intervals to maintain
    accurate status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        hunter->CheckLoneWolfStatus();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked automatically by the AI system or during specific
    game events. It may modify the hunter's current stats, apply or remove auras,
    and update internal state flags related to the Lone Wolf talent.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called excessively in tight loops as it
    might involve expensive checks like group membership or aura validation. Also,
    make sure the hunter object is valid before calling this method.
