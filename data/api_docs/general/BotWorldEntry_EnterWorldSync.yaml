  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::EnterWorldSync(uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes the bot's entry into the game world with a specified timeout.
  description: The EnterWorldSync method is used to synchronize a bot's transition
    into the game world, ensuring that all necessary initialization steps are completed
    before the bot becomes active. This method typically handles the asynchronous
    process of loading the bot's character data, establishing connections to the server,
    and preparing the bot for gameplay. It blocks execution until either the bot successfully
    enters the world or the specified timeout period expires. The method is crucial
    for managing bot lifecycle in TrinityCore environments where multiple bots may
    be spawned simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully entered the world within the specified
    timeout, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate a timeout, connection
    failure, or other initialization errors that prevented successful entry into the
    game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotWorldEntry* botEntry = new BotWorldEntry();\nbool success = botEntry->EnterWorldSync(5000);\
      \ // Wait up to 5 seconds\nif (success) {\n    printf(\"Bot entered world successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to enter world within timeout\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling with Timeout
    code: "BotWorldEntry* bot = GetBotEntry();\nuint32 timeout = 10000; // 10 second\
      \ timeout\nif (!bot->EnterWorldSync(timeout)) {\n    // Handle failure case\
      \ - log error, retry, or cleanup\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Bot failed to enter\
      \ world within {}ms\", timeout);\n    // Additional error handling logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically blocking and should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments. The timeout parameter allows control over how long the system waits
    for successful entry, preventing indefinite blocking. Implementation may involve
    internal state management and synchronization primitives to ensure thread safety
    during the world entry process.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the bot's context
    may lead to undefined behavior or failed entry attempts. The timeout value should
    be chosen carefully to balance responsiveness with reliability - too short a timeout
    may cause premature failures, while too long may block execution unnecessarily.
