  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: SynchronizeObjectiveProgress
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::SynchronizeObjectiveProgress(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes objective progress for a specific quest within a group.
  description: The SynchronizeObjectiveProgress method updates and propagates the
    current progress of a specified quest to all members of a given group. This ensures
    that all players in the group have consistent objective tracking information,
    particularly important for shared quests or group activities. The method likely
    handles communication between the server and clients to refresh quest status displays.
    It is typically invoked when quest progress changes or when a player joins a group
    with an active quest.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest progress
      needs synchronization. Must be a valid group instance.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which objective progress should
      be synchronized. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Synchronize Quest Progress for Group
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    objectiveTracker->SynchronizeObjectiveProgress(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers network updates to all group members, so performance
    impact should be considered when calling it frequently. It's typically used internally
    by the quest system upon progress changes.
