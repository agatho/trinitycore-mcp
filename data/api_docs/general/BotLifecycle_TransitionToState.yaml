  class: BotLifecycle
  method: TransitionToState
  signature: bool BotLifecycle::TransitionToState(BotLifecycleState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the bot lifecycle to a new state and returns true if successful.
  description: The TransitionToState method is responsible for managing the state
    transitions within a bot's lifecycle. It takes a new state as input and attempts
    to transition the bot from its current state to the specified new state. This
    method ensures that state changes are handled properly according to the defined
    lifecycle rules. The method returns true if the transition was successful, or
    false if the transition failed due to invalid state changes or other constraints.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper bot behavior and ensuring
    that bots follow expected operational sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: newState
    description: The target BotLifecycleState to transition to. Must be a valid state
      enum value defined in the BotLifecycleState enumeration.
  returns: Returns true if the state transition was successful, false otherwise. A
    return value of false typically indicates that the requested state transition
    is not allowed or that an error occurred during the transition process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition
    code: "BotLifecycle lifecycle;\nBotLifecycleState newState = BotLifecycleState::BOT_STATE_COMBAT;\n\
      bool success = lifecycle.TransitionToState(newState);\nif (success) {\n    //\
      \ State transition successful\n    printf(\"Bot successfully transitioned to\
      \ combat state\\n\");\n} else {\n    // State transition failed\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to transition bot to combat state\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: State Transition with Error Handling
    code: "BotLifecycle lifecycle;\n// Attempt to transition to idle state\nif (lifecycle.TransitionToState(BotLifecycleState::BOT_STATE_IDLE))\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Bot is now in idle state\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Could\
      \ not transition to idle state - invalid state change\\n\");\n}\n// Attempt\
      \ to transition to combat state\nif (lifecycle.TransitionToState(BotLifecycleState::BOT_STATE_COMBAT))\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Bot is now in combat state\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      Could not transition to combat state\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs validation checks before allowing state transitions.
    It may also trigger callbacks or events when state changes occur. The implementation
    should ensure thread safety if multiple threads can access the same bot lifecycle
    instance.
  warnings: Attempting to transition to an invalid or unsupported state may result
    in a failed transition and return false. Developers should verify that the target
    state is valid before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
