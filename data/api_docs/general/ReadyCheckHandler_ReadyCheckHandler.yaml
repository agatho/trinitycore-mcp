documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ready check handler for a bot AI instance
  description: The ReadyCheckHandler constructor initializes a ready check mechanism
    for a BotAI instance. This method sets up the necessary internal state and callbacks
    to handle player readiness checks within the game environment. It typically configures
    the AI to respond to ready check requests from group members and manages the communication
    between the bot's AI logic and the TrinityCore framework's ready check system.
    The handler ensures that the bot can properly participate in group activities
    that require all members to be ready before proceeding.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI();

      ReadyCheckHandler handler(botAI);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per BotAI instance. The ReadyCheckHandler
    assumes that the provided BotAI pointer is valid and properly initialized before
    construction. The handler will automatically register itself with the game's ready
    check system upon instantiation.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same BotAI instance
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the BotAI parameter
    is not null before calling this constructor.
