  brief: Initializes a new instance of the StormbringerTracker class
  description: The StormbringerTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    StormbringerTracker class. This class is typically used to track and manage the
    state of the Stormbringer weapon ability within the game world. The constructor
    sets up internal data structures and initializes tracking variables necessary
    for monitoring the weapon's effects, cooldowns, and usage statistics. It ensures
    that all member variables are properly initialized before the object can be used
    in gameplay mechanics.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new StormbringerTracker instance
    code: 'StormbringerTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new StormbringerTracker
    object. It performs no complex initialization logic, but ensures all internal
    state variables are properly set to their default values. The class likely integrates
    with TrinityCore's combat system and spell tracking mechanisms.
