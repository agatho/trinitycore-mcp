  signature: void Unit::RemoveOwnedAura(Aura * aura, int removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific aura from the unit's ownership.
  description: This method removes a specified aura from the unit's owned auras, effectively
    detaching the aura from the unit's control. It is used to manage the removal of
    auras that are currently being controlled by the unit, typically in response to
    game mechanics such as spell effects or status changes. The method ensures that
    the aura is properly removed from the unit's aura list and updates the aura's
    state accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: aura
    description: Pointer to the Aura object to be removed. This represents the specific
      aura being controlled by the unit, which must be valid and exist in the unit's
      owned auras.
  - name: removeMode
    description: 'Integer value specifying how the aura should be removed. Valid values
      include: 0 (normal removal), 1 (aura is removed from the unit''s ownership but
      not destroyed), and other values may indicate specific removal behaviors depending
      on the context.'
  returns: null

      {\n    target->RemoveOwnedAura(aura, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects the unit's aura
    state and can impact gameplay mechanics such as spell effects or status changes.
    It is recommended to ensure that the aura exists before calling this method to
    avoid potential null pointer dereferences.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect aura removal, potentially
    causing game mechanics issues or unexpected behavior. Avoid calling this method
    on non-existent auras or without proper validation checks.
