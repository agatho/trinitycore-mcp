  class: EnergyComboResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void EnergyComboResource::Initialize(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the energy combo resource for a player, setting up internal state
    and resetting combo points.
  description: The Initialize method prepares an EnergyComboResource object for use
    with a specific player character. It typically sets up internal tracking structures,
    resets any existing combo point counts, and ensures the resource is in a valid
    initial state. This method is commonly called during player login, class specialization
    changes, or when resetting combo-related mechanics. The method expects a valid
    Player pointer as input and performs necessary setup to synchronize the energy
    combo resource with the player's current game state.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the energy combo resource
      is being initialized. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active player
      character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'EnergyComboResource comboResource;

      Player* player = ...; // Valid player pointer

      comboResource.Initialize(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization During Player Login
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    EnergyComboResource comboResource;\n\
      \    comboResource.Initialize(player);\n    // Additional logic for combo resource\
      \ setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session or when the combo
    resource needs to be reset. It is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore
    framework during player state transitions, but can also be manually called in
    custom modules. The method does not perform any network communication and operates
    purely on local player data.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an active player character. Passing a null or invalid pointer may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. This method should not be called multiple times
    consecutively without proper cleanup between calls.
