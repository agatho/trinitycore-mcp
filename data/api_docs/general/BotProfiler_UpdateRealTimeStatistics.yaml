  signature: void BotProfiler::UpdateRealTimeStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates real-time statistics for bot profiling within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The UpdateRealTimeStatistics method is responsible for collecting and
    updating current performance metrics related to bot behavior and system resource
    usage in real-time. This method typically gathers data such as CPU utilization,
    memory consumption, bot activity levels, and other relevant profiling information
    that helps developers monitor and optimize the performance of AI-controlled bots
    within the World of Warcraft emulator. It is designed to be called periodically
    or upon specific events to ensure accurate and up-to-date profiling data for analysis
    and debugging purposes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Loop
    code: "void BotProfiler::UpdateRealTimeStatistics()\n{\n    // Collect current\
      \ bot statistics\n    uint32 cpuUsage = GetCpuUsage();\n    uint32 memoryUsed\
      \ = GetMemoryUsage();\n    uint32 activeBots = GetActiveBotCount();\n    \n\
      \    // Update internal profiling records\n    m_cpuUsage = cpuUsage;\n    m_memoryUsage\
      \ = memoryUsed;\n    m_activeBotCount = activeBots;\n    \n    // Log or store\
      \ updated statistics\n    LogStatistics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently enough to capture meaningful real-time
    data but not so often as to impact performance. It is recommended to integrate
    this call into the main game loop or a dedicated profiling timer to maintain consistent
    monitoring without introducing significant overhead.
