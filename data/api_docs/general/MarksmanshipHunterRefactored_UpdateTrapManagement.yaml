  method: UpdateTrapManagement
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateTrapManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the management state of traps for a marksmanship hunter, including
    trap placement, activation, and removal logic.
  description: The UpdateTrapManagement method is responsible for handling all aspects
    of trap management within the Marksmanship Hunter's AI behavior. This includes
    checking if traps can be placed, determining optimal placement locations, managing
    trap activation timers, and removing expired or deactivated traps from the game
    world. The method integrates with the hunter's current target selection, environmental
    awareness, and cooldown systems to ensure effective trap usage during combat.
    It also handles interaction with other hunter abilities and ensures that trap
    placement does not conflict with existing game mechanics such as line of sight
    restrictions or terrain obstructions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MarksmanshipHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI\
      \ logic ...\n    m_hunter->UpdateTrapManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the hunter's AI update cycle,
    ideally at regular intervals to maintain proper trap management. The implementation
    may involve complex pathfinding calculations and target evaluation logic to determine
    optimal trap placement positions.
  warnings: Improper handling of trap management can lead to game mechanics conflicts,
    particularly with overlapping traps or incorrect positioning that violates game
    rules. Ensure this method is not called too frequently to avoid performance issues
    in high-density combat scenarios.
