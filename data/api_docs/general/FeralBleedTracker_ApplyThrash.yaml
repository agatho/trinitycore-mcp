  class: FeralBleedTracker
  method: ApplyThrash
  signature: void FeralBleedTracker::ApplyThrash(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a thrash effect to a target with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyThrash method is used to apply a thrash effect to a unit identified
    by its GUID. This method typically operates within the context of Feral Bleed
    mechanics in World of Warcraft's combat system, where thrash effects are applied
    to enemies to cause periodic damage over time. The duration parameter controls
    how long the thrash effect will remain active on the target. This method is generally
    called during spell casting or aura application sequences and may interact with
    existing debuffs or effects on the target.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply the thrash
      effect to. This should be a valid object GUID representing a player or creature
      in the game world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the thrash effect will remain
      active on the target. Must be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ApplyThrash
    code: 'FeralBleedTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyThrash(12345, 6000); // Applies thrash to unit with GUID 12345
      for 6 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying thrash effect in combat context
    code: "void ApplyFeralBleed(Player* player, Unit* target) {\n    if (player &&\
      \ target) {\n        FeralBleedTracker tracker;\n        tracker.ApplyThrash(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ 4000); // Apply for 4 seconds\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the global combat system and may trigger
    additional effects such as threat generation or stacking mechanics. The implementation
    assumes that the target exists and is valid within the game world. It's recommended
    to validate the GUID before calling this method to prevent potential crashes or
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling ApplyThrash with an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target unit is alive and within the valid game world
    bounds before applying the effect. Multiple calls to this method on the same target
    may overwrite previous thrash effects without proper stacking logic.
