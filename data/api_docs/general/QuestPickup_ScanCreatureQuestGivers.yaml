  signature: void QuestPickup::ScanCreatureQuestGivers()
documentation:
  brief: Scans all creature quest givers in the world to update quest availability
    and player interaction states.
  description: The ScanCreatureQuestGivers method iterates through all active creature
    quest givers within the game world, checking their current quest status and updating
    player interaction states accordingly. This method is typically invoked during
    quest system initialization or when quest data changes to ensure that players
    can properly interact with quest givers based on their current quest progress.
    It handles the synchronization of quest availability flags, updates quest tracker
    information, and manages the visibility of quest icons or indicators on creatures.
    The method ensures that quest givers accurately reflect the player's quest state
    and that appropriate quest options are presented to the player during interaction.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.ScanCreatureQuestGivers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup, quest reload operations,
    or when player quest data changes. It performs a full scan of all creature quest
    givers and may have performance implications in large worlds with many active
    quest givers. The method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called
    from within critical sections that could cause deadlocks.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently or in tight loops can lead to performance
    degradation. It should only be invoked when necessary, such as after quest data
    modifications or during server initialization phases. Avoid calling it during
    high-frequency player interactions to prevent potential lag issues.
