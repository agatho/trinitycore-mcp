documentation:
  brief: Initiates mana regeneration for the priest AI unit.
  description: The UseManaRegeneration method is responsible for triggering the mana
    regeneration process specific to the Priest AI. This method typically handles
    the logic required to restore mana over time, considering factors such as the
    priest's current mana level, maximum mana, and any applicable regeneration modifiers
    or effects. It may also manage the timing and rate of mana restoration based on
    game mechanics like meditation, inner focus, or other priest-specific abilities
    that influence mana recovery.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_uiManaRegenTimer\
      \ <= diff)\n    {\n        UseManaRegeneration();\n        m_uiManaRegenTimer\
      \ = 1000; // Reset timer\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_uiManaRegenTimer\
      \ -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to ensure
    continuous mana regeneration. It is recommended to integrate this with a timer-based
    system to control how often regeneration occurs, preventing excessive calls that
    could impact performance.
