  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: MoveToPosition
  signature: bool CombatMovementStrategy::MoveToPosition(Player * player, const int
    & position)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the player to a specified position using combat movement strategy.
  description: The MoveToPosition method executes a movement action for a Player object
    to a designated position within the game world. This method is part of the CombatMovementStrategy
    class and is typically used in AI behavior scripting to control player movement
    during combat scenarios. The method utilizes the player's current combat state
    and movement capabilities to navigate towards the target position while maintaining
    tactical positioning. It returns true upon successful initiation of the movement,
    or false if the movement cannot be started due to invalid parameters or system
    constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will be moved. Must not be null
      and must represent a valid player entity in the game world.
  - name: position
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target position identifier
      or index. The specific meaning of this value depends on the implementation context,
      typically mapping to a predefined location within the combat zone.
  returns: Returns true if the movement to the specified position was successfully
    initiated and queued for execution. Returns false if the movement could not be
    started due to invalid input parameters, player state restrictions, or other system
    limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToPosition
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nint targetPosition = 5;\n\
      if (CombatMovementStrategy::MoveToPosition(player, targetPosition)) {\n    //\
      \ Movement initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player movement started\
      \ to position %d\", targetPosition);\n} else {\n    // Movement failed to start\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to initiate movement to position %d\", targetPosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MoveToPosition in combat AI
    code: "class CombatAI : public ScriptedAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (!UpdateVictim())\n            return;\n    \
      \    \n        Player* player = GetPlayer();\n        int combatPosition = GetCombatPosition();\n\
      \        \n        if (player && !player->IsMoving() && CombatMovementStrategy::MoveToPosition(player,\
      \ combatPosition)) {\n            // Successfully moved to tactical position\n\
      \            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in AI systems and requires that the player
    object be valid and in a state where movement commands can be processed. The position
    parameter should correspond to a pre-defined location within the combat zone's
    movement grid or pathfinding system. Implementation may involve pathfinding calculations
    and collision detection.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. The position value
    must be within valid range for the current map context; invalid positions may
    result in failed movement initiation or unexpected behavior.
