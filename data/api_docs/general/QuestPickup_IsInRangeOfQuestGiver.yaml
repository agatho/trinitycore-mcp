  class: QuestPickup
  method: IsInRangeOfQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestPickup::IsInRangeOfQuestGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is within range of a quest giver for interaction.
  description: The IsInRangeOfQuestGiver method determines whether a specified player
    character is within the acceptable distance to interact with a quest giver object.
    This check is typically used in AI logic or quest-related systems to ensure that
    bots or players can properly engage with quest givers before initiating quest
    acceptance, turn-in, or other related interactions. The method evaluates the physical
    proximity of the player to the quest giver's GUID and returns true if the distance
    is within the game's defined interaction range.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the quest interaction.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver object, typically
      a NPC or GameObject associated with the quest.
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the valid interaction range of the
    quest giver; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest giver proximity
    code: "if (questPickup->IsInRangeOfQuestGiver(player, questGiverGuid)) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with quest interaction\n    player->GossipHello(questGiverGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI logic for bot quest handling
    code: "void BotAI::HandleQuestPickup() {\n    if (IsInRangeOfQuestGiver(bot, questGiverGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Perform quest pickup action\n        bot->QuestPickup(questId);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Move closer to the quest giver\n        bot->MoveTowards(questGiverGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal game mechanics for determining interaction
    range, which may vary based on the type of quest giver (NPC vs GameObject) and
    server configuration. It does not account for line-of-sight or obstacles; it only
    checks spatial proximity.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiverGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual quest
    giver in the world before calling this method, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined
    behavior or errors.
