  class: ObstacleUtils
  method: CalculateTangentPoint
  signature: int ObstacleUtils::CalculateTangentPoint(const int & center, const int
    & obstacle, float radius, bool leftTangent)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the tangent point for an obstacle given a center point,
    obstacle position, radius, and tangent side preference.
  description: The CalculateTangentPoint method computes the geometric tangent point
    on a circular obstacle from a specified center point. This utility is commonly
    used in pathfinding and movement calculations within TrinityCore's AI and navigation
    systems. The method determines whether to return the left or right tangent point
    based on the 'leftTangent' parameter, which is essential for calculating valid
    movement paths around obstacles. It uses basic geometric principles to determine
    the tangent points of a circle from an external point. This function is typically
    invoked during pathfinding operations where units need to navigate around static
    or dynamic obstacles in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The reference point (typically unit position) from which the tangent
      line is calculated. This represents the starting location for the tangent calculation.
  - name: obstacle
    description: The position of the obstacle relative to the center point. This parameter
      defines where the circular obstacle is located in space.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular obstacle. Must be a positive value representing
      the size of the obstacle in game units.
  - name: leftTangent
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to return the left tangent point
      (true) or right tangent point (false). This determines which of the two possible
      tangent points is returned.
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the calculated tangent point.
    The exact meaning of this integer depends on the internal implementation, but
    it typically corresponds to a unique index or reference that can be used for further
    pathfinding calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating left tangent point
    code: int tangentPoint = ObstacleUtils::CalculateTangentPoint(100, 200, 5.0f,
      true); // Calculates left tangent for obstacle at position 200 with radius 5.0
      from center 100
    language: cpp
  - title: Using right tangent point in pathfinding context
    code: int rightTangent = ObstacleUtils::CalculateTangentPoint(playerPosition,
      obstaclePosition, obstacleRadius, false); // Calculates right tangent for navigation
      around obstacle
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the center and obstacle parameters represent positions
    in a 2D coordinate system. The implementation likely uses trigonometric calculations
    to determine the tangent points. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight geometric
    calculation suitable for real-time pathfinding operations. The method should be
    thread-safe as it only performs read-only calculations without modifying shared
    state.
  warnings: Ensure that the radius parameter is positive and non-zero; otherwise,
    the calculation may produce undefined results. Be cautious when using this method
    in high-frequency pathfinding loops as repeated calls could impact performance
    if not optimized. The returned integer value should be validated before use in
    further calculations to prevent invalid references.
