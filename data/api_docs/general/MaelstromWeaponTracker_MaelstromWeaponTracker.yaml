documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MaelstromWeaponTracker class
  description: The MaelstromWeaponTracker constructor initializes the tracking state
    for maelstrom weapons, which are special weapon effects in World of Warcraft that
    accumulate energy over time. This constructor sets up internal data structures
    and state variables required to track the weapon's energy levels, cooldowns, and
    activation status. The tracker is typically used by the game engine to manage
    the behavior of maelstrom-based abilities such as those found on certain legendary
    weapons or artifact weapons in the game.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MaelstromWeaponTracker instance
    code: 'MaelstromWeaponTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track maelstrom weapon effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It primarily
    sets default values for internal tracking variables. The actual tracking of weapon
    energy and effects occurs through other methods in the class, such as Update()
    or ProcessEvent(). This class is likely part of a larger system that manages artifact
    weapon mechanics in TrinityCore.
