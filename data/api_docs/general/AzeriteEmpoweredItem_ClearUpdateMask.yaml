  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask for the azerite empowered item, optionally removing
    it from updates.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method resets the internal update mask of an AzeriteEmpoweredItem
    instance. This is typically used during item state changes or when preparing to
    send updated information about the item to players. When the 'remove' parameter
    is set to true, the item may be fully removed from active update lists or notifications.
    The method ensures that subsequent updates will properly reflect any modifications
    made to the item's azerite properties or status.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: If true, removes the item from update tracking entirely; if false,
      only clears the update mask without removing the item from tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Update Mask Without Removal
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...;

      item->ClearUpdateMask(false); // Clears mask but keeps item in update list'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear Update Mask and Remove Item
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* item = ...;

      item->ClearUpdateMask(true); // Clears mask and removes item from updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    handling item state changes or during player logout. It's important to understand
    that clearing the update mask does not delete the item object itself, but rather
    affects how and when it is sent to clients.
  warnings: Calling this method with 'remove' set to true while the item is still
    referenced elsewhere in the system may lead to inconsistent state or client-side
    issues if not properly synchronized with other systems.
