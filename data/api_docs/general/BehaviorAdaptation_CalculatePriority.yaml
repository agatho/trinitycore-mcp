  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: CalculatePriority
  signature: float BehaviorAdaptation::CalculatePriority(const Experience & exp) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a behavior adaptation based
    on provided experience data.
  description: The CalculatePriority method computes a floating-point priority score
    for a behavior adaptation using the given Experience object. This score typically
    determines how strongly a particular behavior should be prioritized in decision-making
    processes within the AI system. The calculation may consider factors such as player
    level, experience gained, behavior relevance, or other contextual data derived
    from the Experience object. The method is designed to be const, indicating it
    does not modify the state of the BehaviorAdaptation instance. It is commonly used
    in AI-driven systems where behaviors need to be dynamically prioritized based
    on evolving game states and player actions.
  parameters:
  - name: exp
    description: A reference to an Experience object containing data about player
      progress, level, and other relevant metrics that influence behavior priority
      calculation.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority of the behavior adaptation.
    Higher values typically indicate higher priority, though exact interpretation
    may depend on the internal logic of the priority calculation algorithm.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      Experience exp;

      float priority = adaptation.CalculatePriority(exp);

      // ''priority'' now holds the computed behavior priority score'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "BehaviorAdaptation* adaptiveBehavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();\nExperience\
      \ playerExp;\nplayerExp.SetLevel(10);\nplayerExp.SetExperience(5000);\nfloat\
      \ priority = adaptiveBehavior->CalculatePriority(playerExp);\nif (priority >\
      \ 0.7f) {\n    // Activate high-priority behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal logic of how Experience data is interpreted
    to determine behavior priority. Developers should ensure that the Experience object
    passed contains valid and up-to-date information for accurate results. The return
    value is not guaranteed to be normalized between 0 and 1, so callers should validate
    or normalize the result if necessary.
  warnings: Ensure that the Experience object passed to this method is properly initialized
    before calling. Passing an uninitialized or invalid Experience object may lead
    to unpredictable priority calculations. This method does not perform any validation
    on the input data, so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure data integrity.
