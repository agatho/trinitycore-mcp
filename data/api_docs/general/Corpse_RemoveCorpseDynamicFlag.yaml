  class: Corpse
  method: RemoveCorpseDynamicFlag
  signature: void Corpse::RemoveCorpseDynamicFlag(int dynamicFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified dynamic flag from the corpse object.
  description: The RemoveCorpseDynamicFlag method removes a given dynamic flag from
    the corpse's internal flags bitmask. This method is typically used to modify the
    behavior or appearance of a corpse in the game world, such as removing visibility
    or interaction flags. The operation directly affects how the corpse is handled
    by the server and client, potentially changing its state in the game environment.
    This method does not validate the input flag value, so it's important to ensure
    that only valid dynamic flags are passed to prevent unexpected behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: dynamicFlags
    description: The dynamic flag or bitmask of flags to be removed from the corpse.
      This should represent a valid dynamic flag value as defined in the TrinityCore
      codebase for corpse objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a single dynamic flag
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      const uint32 FLAG_HIDDEN = 0x01;

      corpse->RemoveCorpseDynamicFlag(FLAG_HIDDEN);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple dynamic flags using bitwise OR
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      const uint32 FLAG_HIDDEN = 0x01;

      const uint32 FLAG_NO_LOOT = 0x02;

      corpse->RemoveCorpseDynamicFlag(FLAG_HIDDEN | FLAG_NO_LOOT);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the corpse's dynamic flags directly. It is recommended
    to use this method only when necessary, as frequent flag modifications may impact
    performance. The method does not perform any validation on the provided flag value,
    so developers should ensure that only valid flags are used.
  warnings: Passing invalid or unexpected flag values may result in undefined behavior
    or corruption of the corpse's state. Always verify that the flag values being
    removed are valid dynamic flags for corpses within the TrinityCore framework.
