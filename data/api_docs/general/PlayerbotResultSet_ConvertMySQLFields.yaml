  brief: Converts MySQL result fields to player bot internal field format
  description: The ConvertMySQLFields method processes a MySQL result set and converts
    the raw MySQL field data into a format suitable for player bot operations. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore playerbot system to transform
    database query results into actionable data structures that can be processed by
    bot AI logic. The conversion involves mapping MySQL field types and values to
    internal playerbot field representations, ensuring compatibility with the bot's
    decision-making systems. This method operates on the current result set stored
    within the PlayerbotResultSet object and prepares the data for subsequent processing
    or retrieval by bot components.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer array containing the converted field values.
    The array size corresponds to the number of fields in the MySQL result set, with
    each element representing a converted field value. Returns NULL if the conversion
    fails or if no valid result set is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic field conversion example
    code: "PlayerbotResultSet resultSet;\nint* convertedFields = resultSet.ConvertMySQLFields(nullptr);\n\
      if (convertedFields != nullptr) {\n    // Process converted fields\n    for\
      \ (int i = 0; i < resultSet.GetFieldCount(); ++i) {\n        printf(\"Field\
      \ %d: %d\\n\", i, convertedFields[i]);\n    }\n    delete[] convertedFields;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid MySQL result set has been previously loaded
    into the PlayerbotResultSet object. The conversion process may involve type casting
    and data transformation based on internal playerbot field definitions. Memory
    management is the responsibility of the caller, as the returned array must be
    explicitly deallocated using delete[].
  warnings: The method returns a dynamically allocated array that must be freed by
    the caller to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the PlayerbotResultSet contains
    valid data before calling this method, otherwise the result may be unpredictable
    or NULL.
