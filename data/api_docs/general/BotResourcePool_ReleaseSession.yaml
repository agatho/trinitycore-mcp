documentation:
  brief: Releases a bot session back to the resource pool for reuse.
  description: The ReleaseSession method returns a given BotSession object to the
    BotResourcePool, making it available for future allocation to other bots. This
    method is typically called when a bot's session is no longer needed, allowing
    the system to efficiently manage resources by reusing existing session objects
    instead of creating new ones. The released session may be immediately reused or
    held in a pool for later allocation depending on the internal implementation of
    the resource pool.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Release
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = botPool->GetSession();

      // ... use the session ...

      botPool->ReleaseSession(session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when a BotSession is no longer actively used
    by a bot. It's important to ensure that all references to the session are cleared
    before calling ReleaseSession to avoid dangling pointers. The method is typically
    thread-safe if the underlying pool implementation supports concurrent access.
  warnings: Calling ReleaseSession on a session that has already been released may
    lead to undefined behavior or resource corruption. Ensure that each session is
    only released once and that no other code holds references to the session after
    release.
