  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: UnregisterBot
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::UnregisterBot(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from the threat coordination system by its unique identifier.
  description: The UnregisterBot method removes a specified bot from the threat coordination
    system within TrinityCore. This function is typically used when a bot is being
    destroyed, disconnected, or otherwise no longer participating in combat scenarios
    that require threat management. The method ensures that the bot's threat data
    is properly cleaned up and removed from any active threat lists or tracking mechanisms.
    It is important to note that this operation should only be performed on bots that
    have previously been registered with the ThreatCoordinator to avoid potential
    errors or undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered from the
      threat coordination system. This value must correspond to a valid bot that has
      been previously registered with the ThreatCoordinator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Unregistration
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = sThreatCoordinator;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      coordinator->UnregisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal cleanup operations such as removing
    the bot from threat lists, clearing any stored threat data, and updating internal
    tracking structures. The implementation may involve thread synchronization if
    multiple threads are accessing the threat coordinator simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent botGuid may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the bot has been properly registered
    before attempting to unregister it.
