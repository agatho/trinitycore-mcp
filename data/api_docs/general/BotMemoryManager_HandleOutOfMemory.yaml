  method: HandleOutOfMemory
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::HandleOutOfMemory()
documentation:
  brief: Handles memory allocation failures by attempting to free unused bot resources
    and logging the event.
  description: The HandleOutOfMemory method is invoked when a memory allocation request
    within the BotMemoryManager fails due to insufficient available memory. This method
    attempts to recover from the out-of-memory condition by freeing up unused or stale
    bot data structures, resetting internal caches, and logging the occurrence for
    debugging purposes. It serves as a critical recovery mechanism in environments
    where multiple AI bots are actively managed, helping prevent crashes and maintain
    system stability during high-load scenarios. The method does not throw exceptions
    but may alter the state of bot memory management to reduce memory consumption.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Memory Management Context
    code: "void SomeBotManager::OnMemoryAllocationFailure()\n{\n    m_BotMemoryManager.HandleOutOfMemory();\n\
      \    // Continue with fallback logic or retry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the memory manager when a new
    allocation fails. It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, focusing on
    freeing up resources rather than performing heavy operations. Developers should
    ensure that any data freed by this method can safely be reinitialized later without
    causing inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method directly from user code may lead to unexpected behavior
    if not properly synchronized with other memory management routines. It is intended
    for internal use within the BotMemoryManager and should not be invoked manually
    unless specifically required for custom recovery logic.
