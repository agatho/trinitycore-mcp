  class: AzeriteItem
  method: GetEssenceRank
  signature: int AzeriteItem::GetEssenceRank(int azeriteEssenceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the rank of a specified Azerite essence associated with the item.
  description: The GetEssenceRank method returns the current rank level of a given
    Azerite essence that is embedded within the Azerite item. This rank determines
    the power and effectiveness of the essence's abilities. The method takes an azeriteEssenceId
    parameter which identifies the specific essence to query. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with Azerite progression systems, where players can unlock and
    upgrade essences to enhance their character's capabilities. The returned value
    typically represents a numeric rank from 1 to the maximum allowed rank for that
    particular essence type.
  parameters:
  - name: azeriteEssenceId
    description: The unique identifier of the Azerite essence for which to retrieve
      the rank. This ID corresponds to specific essence types defined in the game's
      database.
  returns: An integer representing the current rank of the specified Azerite essence.
    Returns 0 if the essence is not found or not active on the item. The rank usually
    ranges from 1 up to the maximum possible rank for that essence type, which may
    vary based on game mechanics and item level.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Essence Rank
    code: "int rank = azeriteItem->GetEssenceRank(12345);\nif (rank > 0) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Essence rank: \" << rank << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"\
      Essence not found or inactive.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AzeriteItem object has been properly initialized
    with valid Azerite data. The essence rank returned may be affected by item upgrades,
    player level, and other game progression factors. Performance is generally fast
    as it operates on cached or precomputed data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the azeriteEssenceId passed is valid; invalid IDs might return
    unexpected results or cause undefined behavior. This method should not be called
    on items that do not support Azerite mechanics, as it may lead to incorrect data
    retrieval.
