    & details) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a trade action with associated details to the system's trade log.
  description: The LogTradeAction method records a specific trade-related event along
    with descriptive information into the game's logging system. This functionality
    is typically used to track player interactions during trades, such as item exchanges,
    gold transactions, or other trade-related activities. The method does not return
    any value but ensures that all relevant trade events are properly documented for
    auditing, debugging, or gameplay analysis purposes. It is designed to be called
    during various stages of the trading process to maintain a complete and accurate
    trade history.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the type of trade action being logged (e.g.,
      'Item Exchange', 'Gold Transfer', 'Trade Completed'). This parameter defines
      the category or nature of the trade event.
  - name: details
    description: A string containing additional information about the trade action,
      such as item names, quantities, player GUIDs, or monetary amounts involved in
      the transaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Logging Example
    code: 'TradeManager tm;

      tm.LogTradeAction("Item Exchange", "Player A traded 2 Health Potions for 1 Mana
      Potion with Player B");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Trade Logging with Dynamic Data
    code: 'std::string action = "Gold Transfer";

      std::string details = "Player " + playerGuid.ToString() + " transferred 500g
      to Player " + targetGuid.ToString();

      tm.LogTradeAction(action, details);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger trade management system and may integrate
    with TrinityCore's logging infrastructure. It should be invoked at key points
    during the trading process to ensure comprehensive tracking without impacting
    performance significantly. The const qualifier indicates that this method does
    not modify internal state of the TradeManager object.
  warnings: Ensure that sensitive player data is sanitized before being passed into
    the details parameter to prevent potential security issues or log injection attacks.
    Also, be mindful of logging frequency to avoid excessive disk I/O or database
    overhead in high-traffic scenarios.
