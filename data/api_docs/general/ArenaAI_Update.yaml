  method: Update
  signature: void ArenaAI::Update(int * player, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the arena AI behavior based on elapsed time and player state
  description: The ArenaAI::Update method is responsible for managing the artificial
    intelligence behavior of players during arena matches. This method processes game
    events, updates player states, and handles combat logic specific to arena environments.
    It takes a pointer to an integer representing the player's current state and a
    time delta value indicating how much time has passed since the last update. The
    method ensures that arena-specific mechanics such as cooldowns, spell usage, and
    tactical decisions are properly executed according to the game's arena rules.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current player state or identifier
      within the arena context
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since the last update call, used for timing-based
      AI decisions and cooldown management
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arena AI Update Call
    code: "void UpdateArenaAI(Player* player, uint32 diff) {\n    int playerState\
      \ = player->GetArenaTeamId();\n    arenaAI.Update(&playerState, diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateArenas(uint32 diff) {\n    for (auto& player : arenaPlayers)\
      \ {\n        int state = player->GetArenaState();\n        player->GetArenaAI()->Update(&state,\
      \ diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals.
    The player parameter should point to a valid arena player state variable that
    reflects current match conditions. Performance considerations include avoiding
    expensive operations within this method as it's called frequently during active
    arena matches.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer for the player parameter may cause
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the diff value is always positive and represents
    actual elapsed time to maintain proper AI timing.
