  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::WhisperReceived(int player, int target, std::string
    msg)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a SocialEvent object representing a whisper received
    from one player to another.
  description: The WhisperReceived method is used to construct a SocialEvent that
    represents an incoming whisper message in the World of Warcraft game environment.
    This method is typically invoked when a player sends a private message to another
    player, and it encapsulates the relevant data such as sender, recipient, and message
    content into a structured event object. The returned SocialEvent can then be processed
    by the game's social system or dispatched to appropriate handlers for further
    action. This method does not directly send the whisper but rather prepares the
    event structure that would be used in the whisper delivery mechanism.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player sending the whisper message.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player receiving the whisper
      message.
  - name: msg
    description: The text content of the whisper message being sent from player to
      target.
  returns: A SocialEvent object representing the whisper received event, containing
    information about the sender, receiver, and message content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::WhisperReceived(12345, 67890, "Hello there!");
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Whisper Event
    code: 'SocialEvent whisper = SocialEvent::WhisperReceived(playerGuid, targetGuid,
      "Private message");

      // Process the event through social system

      HandleSocialEvent(whisper);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's social event handling framework and
    should be used in conjunction with other SocialEvent methods for complete messaging
    functionality. The returned SocialEvent object may require additional processing
    before the whisper is actually delivered to the target player.
  warnings: Ensure that player and target GUIDs are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or failed message delivery.
    This method does not perform any validation on the message content itself.
