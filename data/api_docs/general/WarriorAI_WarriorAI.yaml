api:
  class: WarriorAI
  method: WarriorAI
  signature: void WarriorAI::WarriorAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WarriorAI instance with the specified player bot.
  description: The WarriorAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a player-controlled
    warrior bot. This method sets up internal state variables and prepares the AI
    to handle combat decisions, movement patterns, and spell usage specific to warrior
    class mechanics. The initialization process includes configuring threat management,
    ability selection logic, and positioning strategies tailored for warrior gameplay.
    It ensures that the bot's AI is properly linked to the player object and ready
    to execute combat routines.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the warrior bot that this
      AI will control. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WarriorAI Initialization
    code: 'Player* warriorBot = new Player();

      WarriorAI* ai = new WarriorAI(warriorBot);

      // AI is now initialized and ready to control the warrior bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The 'bot' parameter
    must point to a valid Player object that has been properly constructed and configured
    as a warrior class character. The AI will automatically manage its own memory
    and cleanup when destroyed.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized before
    passing it to this constructor.
