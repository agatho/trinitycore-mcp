  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ExecuteTaunt
  signature: bool ThreatCoordinator::ExecuteTaunt(int tankGuid, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a taunt ability on a target unit, transferring threat from the current
    tank to the specified target.
  description: The ExecuteTaunt method is used in TrinityCore's AI system to perform
    a taunt action on a target unit. This method attempts to transfer threat from
    the current tank to the specified target, effectively causing the target to become
    the new primary threat source for the creature. The method typically involves
    checking if the taunt can be successfully executed based on game mechanics such
    as target validity, distance, and threat conditions. It is commonly used in boss
    encounters or scripted AI behaviors where controlling which unit holds aggro is
    important for proper encounter management.
  parameters:
  - name: tankGuid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the current tank unit that
      will be taunted. This identifies which unit is currently holding threat and
      will lose it.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the taunt effect. This
      represents the target unit that will gain threat from the tank.
  returns: Returns true if the taunt was successfully executed and threat was transferred,
    false otherwise. The method may return false if the taunt fails due to invalid
    parameters, target conditions, or game logic restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Execution
    code: "if (threatCoordinator->ExecuteTaunt(playerGuid, targetUnit)) {\n    //\
      \ Taunt successful, threat transferred\n    targetUnit->AddThreat(player, 100.0f);\n\
      } else {\n    // Taunt failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to execute taunt\
      \ on target %u\", targetUnit->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Taunt with Precondition Check
    code: "if (player && targetUnit && player->IsInWorld() && targetUnit->IsInWorld())\
      \ {\n    if (threatCoordinator->ExecuteTaunt(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ targetUnit)) {\n        // Successfully taunted\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %u taunted unit %u\", player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), targetUnit->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ThreatCoordinator system used in AI behavior trees
    and scripted encounters. It's commonly called during boss fight mechanics where
    precise control over threat distribution is required. The method may perform internal
    checks for valid targets, distance constraints, and existing threat conditions
    before executing.
  warnings: Ensure that both tankGuid and target parameters are valid before calling
    this method. Passing invalid GUIDs or null pointers can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes in the AI system. This method should only be called from within a valid
    AI context where threat management is appropriate.
