  class: GameObjectModel
  method: DisableLosBlocking
  signature: void GameObjectModel::DisableLosBlocking(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Disables or enables line-of-sight blocking for the game object model.
  description: The DisableLosBlocking method controls whether the GameObjectModel
    instance blocks line-of-sight calculations. When enabled, the model will prevent
    visibility checks from passing through it, which is essential for proper collision
    detection and NPC vision mechanics in World of Warcraft. This method is typically
    used during dynamic object modifications or special effects where temporary sight
    obstruction needs to be disabled. The change takes effect immediately on the model
    and affects all subsequent line-of-sight queries involving this object.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines the LOS blocking state. If true, line-of-sight
      blocking is enabled; if false, it is disabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable LOS Blocking for a GameObject Model
    code: 'GameObjectModel* model = ...;

      model->DisableLosBlocking(false); // Disables LOS blocking

      // Now NPCs can see through this object'
    language: cpp
  - title: Toggle LOS Blocking Based on Game State
    code: "if (someCondition)\n{\n    model->DisableLosBlocking(true);  // Enable\
      \ LOS blocking\n}\nelse\n{\n    model->DisableLosBlocking(false); // Disable\
      \ LOS blocking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal collision flags of the GameObjectModel.
    It should be used carefully as it can affect AI pathfinding and vision systems.
    Changes made using this method are persistent until another call is made to modify
    the state.
  warnings: Disabling LOS blocking may cause unexpected behavior in AI vision systems
    or line-of-sight dependent mechanics. Ensure that disabling this feature aligns
    with intended gameplay behavior, especially for interactive objects or doors that
    should normally block sight.
