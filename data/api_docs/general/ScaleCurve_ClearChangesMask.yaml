  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void ScaleCurve::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the scale curve, resetting its modified state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the ScaleCurve object. This operation typically indicates that any previous
    modifications to the curve's scaling parameters have been acknowledged or committed,
    effectively clearing the 'dirty' flag that tracks whether the curve has been altered
    since last synchronization or reset. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method is commonly used in animation and object scaling systems where changes
    need to be tracked for network synchronization or rendering updates. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ScaleCurve curve;

      curve.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after applying or acknowledging changes made
    to a scale curve, ensuring that subsequent operations do not consider the curve
    as modified. It may be used internally by the core engine during update cycles
    or when sending data over the network.
