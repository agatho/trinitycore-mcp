documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player can afford the cost of a flight path
  description: Determines whether the player associated with this FlightMasterManager
    has sufficient gold to pay for a flight path. This method evaluates the player's
    current money against the specified cost, taking into account the player's inventory
    and monetary state. The check is typically performed before allowing a player
    to initiate a flight or when displaying flight path costs in the UI. It does not
    modify any game state but simply returns a boolean result indicating affordability.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the player has enough gold to cover the cost, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Affordability Check
    code: "if (flightMaster->CanAffordFlight(1000)) {\n    // Player can afford 1000\
      \ gold flight\n    player->SendFlightPathList();\n} else {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ afford the flight\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You do not have enough\
      \ gold.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FlightMasterManager is properly initialized
    with a valid player context. The cost parameter should represent the exact amount
    in copper coins as used internally by TrinityCore's currency system.
