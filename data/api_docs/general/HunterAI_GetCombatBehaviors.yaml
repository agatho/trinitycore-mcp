  class: HunterAI
  method: GetCombatBehaviors
  signature: CombatBehaviorIntegration * HunterAI::GetCombatBehaviors() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the combat behavior integration object for the hunter
    AI.
  description: The GetCombatBehaviors method retrieves the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance associated with the HunterAI class. This integration object contains
    all the combat-related behaviors and logic that define how a hunter AI unit should
    act during combat situations. The returned pointer provides access to various
    combat strategies, target selection mechanisms, and tactical decision-making components
    that govern the AI's fighting behavior. The method is typically used internally
    by the AI system to fetch the current combat configuration and apply appropriate
    actions based on the integration's defined behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a CombatBehaviorIntegration object which holds all combat-related
    behavioral logic for the hunter AI. Returns nullptr if no combat behavior integration
    has been initialized or assigned to this AI instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Behaviors
    code: "HunterAI* ai = static_cast<HunterAI*>(unit->GetAI());\nCombatBehaviorIntegration*\
      \ behaviors = ai->GetCombatBehaviors();\nif (behaviors)\n{\n    // Use the combat\
      \ behaviors for tactical decisions\n    behaviors->UpdateCombatState(unit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system's internal architecture and should typically
    not be called directly by external code. The returned pointer is valid only as
    long as the HunterAI instance exists and has been properly initialized with combat
    behaviors. Developers should ensure that proper null checks are performed before
    using the returned pointer.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured HunterAI
    instance may return a nullptr, leading to potential crashes if not handled correctly.
    Always validate the return value before dereferencing the pointer.
