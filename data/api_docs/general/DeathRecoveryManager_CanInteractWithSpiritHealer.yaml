  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::CanInteractWithSpiritHealer() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can interact with a spirit healer after death.
  description: The CanInteractWithSpiritHealer method checks if the current player
    character is in a state where they can interact with a spirit healer to recover
    from death. This typically involves verifying that the player has not already
    used their spirit healer interaction, that they are in a valid death state, and
    that the necessary game conditions are met for spirit healer access. The method
    is commonly used during the death recovery process to control when players can
    return to life via spirit healers rather than traditional resurrection mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can interact with a spirit healer, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's current state allows them to use the spirit
    healer for death recovery.
  examples:
  - title: Check Spirit Healer Interaction Eligibility
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager->CanInteractWithSpiritHealer()) {\n    // Allow\
      \ player to interact with spirit healer\n    player->SendSpiritHealerQueue();\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent interaction or show error message\n    player->SendDeathNotResurrected();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal state flags related to death recovery,
    such as whether the player has already used their spirit healer opportunity, time
    since death, or if they are in a valid zone for spirit healer interaction. It
    may also consider player faction, level restrictions, or other game-specific conditions.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of death recovery contexts as it may return
    unexpected results if the player is not in a death state. The method should only
    be used when determining appropriate death recovery options for players.
