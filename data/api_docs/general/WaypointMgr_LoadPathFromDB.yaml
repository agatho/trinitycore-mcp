documentation:
  brief: Loads a waypoint path from the database into memory for use by NPCs.
  description: The LoadPathFromDB method retrieves waypoint data associated with a
    specific NPC from the database and initializes it in memory. This function is
    typically invoked during server startup or when an NPC is spawned to ensure that
    the creature's movement path is correctly loaded and ready for execution. It processes
    the provided PathQueryResult which contains all necessary information about waypoints
    such as position, delay, and orientation. The method ensures that the waypoint
    data is properly formatted and validated before being added to the internal waypoint
    manager structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During NPC Initialization
    code: "void InitializeNPCWaypoints(uint32 npcEntry)\n{\n    // Assume PathQueryResult\
      \ is already populated with data\n    // from database query for the given NPC\
      \ entry\n    WaypointMgr::LoadPathFromDB(pathResult);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PathQueryResult parameter contains valid and
    complete waypoint data for a single path. It does not perform any validation on
    the data itself, so it's expected that the calling code has already filtered or
    verified the data before passing it to this function.
  warnings: Improperly formatted or incomplete PathQueryResult data can lead to runtime
    errors or undefined behavior. Ensure all required fields are present and correctly
    ordered before invoking this method.
