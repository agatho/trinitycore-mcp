  class: LootStrategy
  method: FindLootableObjects
  signature: int LootStrategy::FindLootableObjects(BotAI * ai, float maxDistance)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the count of lootable objects within the specified maximum
    distance for a bot AI.
  description: The FindLootableObjects method searches for nearby objects that can
    be looted by a bot AI within a given maximum distance. It iterates through the
    game world to identify eligible lootable entities such as corpses, containers,
    or other interactive objects. The method is typically used in bot AI logic to
    determine available loot targets. This function does not modify the state of the
    objects themselves but rather identifies and counts them based on their looting
    eligibility and proximity to the bot. It's an essential part of automated loot
    collection systems within TrinityCore-based bots.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will perform the loot search.
      This parameter is required and must not be null.
  - name: maxDistance
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which to search for lootable objects.
      Objects beyond this distance are ignored. Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of lootable objects found within
    the specified maximum distance. A return value of zero indicates no eligible lootable
    objects were found, while a positive integer indicates the count of such objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby loot
    code: "int lootCount = strategy->FindLootableObjects(botAI, 30.0f);\nif (lootCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with loot collection logic\n    std::cout << \"Found\
      \ \" << lootCount << \" lootable objects.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the result to prioritize loot targets
    code: "float maxDistance = 25.0f;\nint lootCount = strategy->FindLootableObjects(botAI,\
      \ maxDistance);\nif (lootCount > 0)\n{\n    // Prioritize high-value loot based\
      \ on count\n    if (lootCount >= 5)\n        botAI->SetLootPriority(LootPriority::HIGH);\n\
      \    else\n        botAI->SetLootPriority(LootPriority::MEDIUM);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the BotAI's internal state and world scanning capabilities.
    It may be computationally expensive if the search distance is large or if many
    objects are present in the area. The method does not perform any actual looting;
    it only identifies potential targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. Be cautious when
    using large maxDistance values in performance-sensitive contexts.
