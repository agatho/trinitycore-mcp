  class: Unit
  method: UpdateDisplayPower
  signature: void Unit::UpdateDisplayPower()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the power display for the unit, synchronizing its current power value
    with the client.
  description: The UpdateDisplayPower method is responsible for refreshing and synchronizing
    a Unit's power (such as mana, rage, energy, or focus) with the client-side display.
    This ensures that the player or creature's power bar reflects the most recent
    power state. The method typically gets called when there are changes to the unit's
    power value, such as when taking damage, casting spells, or using abilities that
    consume power. It handles internal updates and sends necessary packets to connected
    clients to visually represent the updated power status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetVictim();

      unit->UpdateDisplayPower();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Power After Spell Cast
    code: "if (player->GetPower(POWER_MANA) >= spellInfo->ManaCost)\n{\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA,\
      \ -spellInfo->ManaCost);\n    player->UpdateDisplayPower();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core when power changes
    occur through standard gameplay mechanics. Developers should not usually need
    to call it manually unless implementing custom behavior or debugging power synchronization
    issues.
  warnings: Calling UpdateDisplayPower manually without a valid reason may result
    in unnecessary network traffic and client-side updates, potentially affecting
    performance in high-traffic scenarios.
