  method: GetKitePosition
  signature: int SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetKitePosition(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal kite position for the hunter to maintain
    distance from the target while keeping line of sight.
  description: The GetKitePosition method determines the best positioning strategy
    for a Survival Hunter to kite an enemy target. It evaluates the hunter's current
    distance, the target's movement pattern, and environmental factors to compute
    a safe retreat position that maintains optimal range and line of sight. This method
    is crucial for survival mechanics in combat scenarios where maintaining distance
    from enemies is essential. The returned value represents a calculated position
    vector or state identifier that guides the AI's movement behavior. The method
    assumes the hunter has a valid target assigned and that the target is within the
    hunter's detection range.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated kite position state. A positive
    value typically indicates a specific movement direction or distance, while negative
    values may represent error conditions or special states such as 'too close' or
    'out of range'. Zero usually means no kiting action is required or the target
    is at optimal distance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "int kitePosition = hunter.GetKitePosition();\nif (kitePosition > 0) {\n\
      \    // Move backward to maintain distance\n    hunter.MoveBackward(kitePosition);\n\
      } else if (kitePosition < 0) {\n    // Target is too close, need to reposition\n\
      \    hunter.Flee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with movement system
    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UpdateKiting() {\n    int target = GetTargetGUID();\n\
      \    int position = GetKitePosition(&target);\n    \n    switch (position) {\n\
      \        case 1:\n            MoveToPosition(10.0f); // Move back 10 yards\n\
      \            break;\n        case 2:\n            StrafeLeft(5.0f);\n      \
      \      break;\n        case -1:\n            // Target too close, initiate emergency\
      \ escape\n            Escape();\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Survival Hunter's core AI logic and should be
    called frequently during combat to maintain optimal positioning. The implementation
    likely considers factors such as target speed, hunter speed, available terrain,
    and threat level. Performance-wise, this method should execute quickly as it's
    called in tight combat loops. The method may cache previous calculations for efficiency
    but should not rely on stale data for critical decisions.
  warnings: Do not call this method without a valid target assigned to the hunter.
    The method may return unpredictable results if the target is null or invalid.
    The returned integer values are implementation-specific and should not be interpreted
    as absolute coordinates, but rather as relative movement instructions.
