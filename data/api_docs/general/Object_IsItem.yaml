  brief: Determines whether the object is an item
  description: The IsItem() method checks if the current Object instance represents
    an item in the World of Warcraft game. This method is part of the Object class
    hierarchy and provides a way to distinguish between different types of objects
    within the game world. It returns true when the object is an item, false otherwise.
    The method is commonly used in game logic to differentiate between items and other
    object types such as creatures or game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is an item, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the current object instance represents an item within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Object* obj = new Item();

      bool isItem = obj->IsItem();

      // isItem will be true if obj represents an item'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other object type checking
    methods like IsCreature() or IsGameObject() to determine the specific type of
    object. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight operation that simply checks the
    object's type flags.
  warnings: Be aware that this method should not be used to determine if an object
    is an item when the object is actually a player or other non-item type. It's important
    to use proper type checking methods for accurate results.
