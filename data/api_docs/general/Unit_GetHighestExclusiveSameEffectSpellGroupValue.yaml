  signature: int32 Unit::GetHighestExclusiveSameEffectSpellGroupValue(const AuraEffect
    * aurEff, int auraType, bool checkMiscValue, int32 miscValue) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the highest exclusive same effect spell group value for a given aura
    effect.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum value from a specific spell group
    that shares the same effect type as the provided aura effect. It is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft mechanics to determine the highest value among similar spell
    effects, particularly when dealing with exclusive spell groups where multiple
    spells may have identical effects but different values. The method considers various
    parameters including aura type and misc value, making it useful for determining
    spell strength or effectiveness within a group context.
  parameters:
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect object that defines the effect being analyzed.
      This is typically used to determine which spell group the effect belongs to.
  - name: auraType
    description: The type of aura effect being evaluated. This helps identify the
      specific category of spell effects being compared, such as aura type 1, 2, etc.
  - name: checkMiscValue
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to consider the misc value when determining
      the highest value. If true, the method will take into account the misc value
      for comparison.
  - name: miscValue
    description: The specific misc value to be considered when checking for exclusive
      same effect spell group values. This parameter allows for precise control over
      how the comparison is made.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the highest exclusive same effect spell
    group value found within the specified aura effect and its associated parameters.
    If no matching value exists, returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int32 value = unit->GetHighestExclusiveSameEffectSpellGroupValue(aurEff,
      auraType, checkMiscValue, miscValue);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: int32 result = unit->GetHighestExclusiveSameEffectSpellGroupValue(aurEff,
      1, true, 5);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell mechanics where exclusive spell groups
    are involved. It requires careful handling of aura effects and their associated
    parameters to ensure correct behavior. Performance-wise, it may involve multiple
    iterations over spell groups depending on implementation.
  warnings: The method might behave differently depending on how the aura effect is
    defined or whether it's part of a larger spell group. Care must be taken when
    using this in conjunction with other methods that manipulate spell groups to avoid
    unexpected results.
