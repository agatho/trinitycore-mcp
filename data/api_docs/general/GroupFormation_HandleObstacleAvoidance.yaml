  class: GroupFormation
  method: HandleObstacleAvoidance
  signature: void GroupFormation::HandleObstacleAvoidance(const int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Handles obstacle avoidance logic for group formations in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleObstacleAvoidance method processes and applies obstacle avoidance
    behaviors to group members within a formation. This method is typically invoked
    during pathfinding operations to ensure that group movement avoids environmental
    obstacles such as walls, terrain features, or other impassable objects. It modifies
    the group's movement behavior dynamically based on detected obstacles in the environment.
    The method operates on a provided obstacle count parameter which determines how
    many obstacles are considered when calculating avoidance paths.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacles
    description: An integer reference representing the number of obstacles detected
      in the group's path. This value influences how the avoidance algorithm calculates
      alternative routes for the group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle avoidance handling
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      int obstacleCount = 5;

      formation->HandleObstacleAvoidance(obstacleCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic obstacle count processing
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      int currentObstacles = CalculateNearbyObstacles(player->GetPosition());

      formation->HandleObstacleAvoidance(currentObstacles);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group movement AI system and should be called
    during pathfinding updates. It modifies internal formation state and may affect
    the positioning of all group members. The implementation assumes that obstacle
    data has already been processed and passed to this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper obstacle data can lead to incorrect
    path calculations or erratic group behavior. Ensure that the obstacle count parameter
    accurately reflects environmental conditions to maintain realistic group movement.
