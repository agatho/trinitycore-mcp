  class: InstanceEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: void InstanceEventBus::DeliverEvent(const InstanceEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers an instance event to all registered listeners in the event bus.
  description: The DeliverEvent method broadcasts a given InstanceEvent to all registered
    subscribers within the InstanceEventBus. This mechanism allows for decoupled communication
    between different systems within a World of Warcraft instance, enabling components
    to react to events without direct dependencies. The method ensures that all registered
    listeners receive the event in a timely manner, facilitating modular and maintainable
    code design. Events are typically used for handling instance-specific occurrences
    such as boss encounters, door states, or quest progress changes.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The InstanceEvent object to be delivered to all registered listeners.
      This parameter contains the event data and metadata that will be propagated
      through the event bus system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: 'InstanceEvent bossDefeatedEvent;

      bossDefeatedEvent.type = INSTANCE_EVENT_BOSS_DEFEATED;

      bossDefeatedEvent.data = 12345; // Boss entry ID

      instanceEventBus.DeliverEvent(bossDefeatedEvent);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delivering Custom Instance Event
    code: 'InstanceEvent doorStateChangedEvent;

      doorStateChangedEvent.type = INSTANCE_EVENT_DOOR_STATE_CHANGED;

      doorStateChangedEvent.data = 67890; // Door GUID

      instanceEventBus.DeliverEvent(doorStateChangedEvent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within instance management code and
    should be used carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks. The event bus operates
    synchronously, meaning delivery blocks until all listeners have processed the
    event. Consider using asynchronous patterns for high-frequency events.
  warnings: Avoid calling DeliverEvent with large or complex event objects as it may
    impact performance. Ensure that event listeners do not perform long-running operations
    or recursive calls that could cause deadlocks or stack overflow.
