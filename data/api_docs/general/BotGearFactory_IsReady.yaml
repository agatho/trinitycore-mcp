  class: BotGearFactory
  method: IsReady
  signature: bool BotGearFactory::IsReady() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot gear factory is ready to generate or process gear for bots.
  description: The IsReady method determines whether the BotGearFactory instance has
    completed its initialization and is prepared to handle gear generation or modification
    tasks for bot characters. This typically involves verifying that required resources,
    configurations, and dependencies are properly loaded and available. The method
    may check internal state flags, validate data structures, or ensure that prerequisite
    systems (such as item databases or configuration files) are accessible before
    allowing gear operations to proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotGearFactory is fully initialized and ready to process
    gear-related requests; otherwise returns false if initialization is incomplete
    or a critical dependency is missing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botGearFactory.IsReady()) {\n    // Proceed with bot gear generation\n\
      \    botGearFactory.GenerateGearForBot(bot);\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure or pending setup\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"BotGearFactory is not ready\
      \ to generate gear.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before attempting any gear generation operations
    to avoid runtime errors due to incomplete initialization. It's recommended to
    cache the result of this check if it's used frequently in performance-sensitive
    code paths.
