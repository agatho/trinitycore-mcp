documentation:
  brief: Records a spawn attempt in the circuit breaker mechanism to track failure
    rates and prevent system overload.
  description: The RecordAttempt method logs a spawn attempt within the SpawnCircuitBreaker
    class, which is used to monitor and control the frequency of object spawning operations.
    This mechanism helps prevent excessive resource consumption or server overload
    by tracking how often spawn attempts occur. The method typically updates internal
    counters or timestamps that determine whether subsequent spawn requests should
    be allowed or blocked based on configured thresholds. It's commonly used in game
    systems where controlled spawning of creatures, game objects, or other entities
    is necessary to maintain performance and stability.

  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "void MySpawnHandler::AttemptSpawn()\n{\n    // Record the spawn attempt\
      \ before proceeding\n    m_circuitBreaker.RecordAttempt();\n    \n    if (m_circuitBreaker.CanSpawn())\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with actual spawning logic\n        SpawnCreature();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle circuit breaker tripped case\n  \
      \      LOG_DEBUG(\"spawn\", \"Spawn attempt blocked by circuit breaker\");\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called at the beginning of spawn operations before
    any actual spawning logic executes. It's designed to be lightweight and thread-safe,
    as it may be called frequently during high-traffic server events such as world
    PvP or large-scale creature spawns.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the circuit breaker
    state can lead to incorrect tracking. Ensure that the circuit breaker is properly
    configured with appropriate thresholds before calling RecordAttempt in production
    code.
