  signature: void SummonList::RemoveNotExisting()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all summons from the list that no longer exist in the world
  description: The RemoveNotExisting method iterates through the current summon list
    and removes any entries that correspond to summons which are no longer present
    in the game world. This typically occurs when a summoned creature or object has
    been destroyed, despawned, or otherwise invalidated. The method ensures the internal
    list accurately reflects only active summons, preventing dangling references and
    maintaining data integrity. It is commonly called during cleanup operations or
    before iterating over summons to avoid processing invalid entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        // Remove any summons that no longer exist\n\
      \        summons.RemoveNotExisting();\n        \n        // Now safely iterate\
      \ over valid summons\n        for (auto& summon : summons)\n        {\n    \
      \        if (summon)\n                DoSomethingWithSummon(summon);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core during certain
    cleanup phases, but can also be invoked manually when precise control over summon
    state is required. It performs a check for each entry's existence using internal
    validity flags or object references.
  warnings: Calling this method while iterating over the summon list directly may
    lead to undefined behavior if not properly synchronized. Always ensure that any
    external references to summons are invalidated before calling this method.
