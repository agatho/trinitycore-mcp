  method: DispelCoordinator
  signature: void DispelCoordinator::DispelCoordinator(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DispelCoordinator instance with the provided BotAI context.
  description: The DispelCoordinator constructor initializes a new instance of the
    DispelCoordinator class, associating it with a specific BotAI context. This class
    is responsible for managing and coordinating dispel operations within the AI framework,
    particularly for handling magical effects and debuffs on targets. The constructor
    sets up internal state and references needed to perform dispel actions based on
    the AI's current strategy and target selection. It ensures that the coordinator
    has access to necessary AI components such as spell casting capabilities, target
    tracking, and cooldown management.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DispelCoordinator Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* ai = new BotAI();

      DispelCoordinator dispelCoord(ai);

      // The dispel coordinator is now initialized with the AI context'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per DispelCoordinator instance.
    The BotAI parameter must not be null, as it's required for all subsequent operations.
    The DispelCoordinator does not take ownership of the BotAI pointer and assumes
    it remains valid throughout the coordinator's lifetime.
  warnings: Passing a null BotAI pointer to this constructor will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes during subsequent dispel operations. Ensure that
    the BotAI object is properly initialized before creating the DispelCoordinator
    instance.
