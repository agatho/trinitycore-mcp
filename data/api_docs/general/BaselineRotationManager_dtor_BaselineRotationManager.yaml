  class: BaselineRotationManager
  method: ~BaselineRotationManager
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::~BaselineRotationManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BaselineRotationManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BaselineRotationManager class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the manager.
    This includes cleaning up internal data structures, resetting state variables,
    and ensuring that no memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope. In
    the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this destructor ensures
    proper cleanup of AI rotation logic and associated game state tracking for player
    or NPC behavior patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BaselineRotationManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BaselineRotationManager manager;\n    // ...\
      \ use manager ...\n    // manager is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when a BaselineRotationManager object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other
    objects hold references to this manager after its destruction to prevent dangling
    pointer issues.
