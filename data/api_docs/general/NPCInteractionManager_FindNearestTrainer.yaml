  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: FindNearestTrainer
  signature: Creature * NPCInteractionManager::FindNearestTrainer() const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest Creature object that serves as a trainer for
    the NPC interaction manager's associated player.
  description: The FindNearestTrainer method searches for the closest creature in
    the world that is classified as a trainer. It typically looks through all active
    creatures within a reasonable range to identify one that provides training services
    such as skill or spell learning. This method is commonly used during NPC interaction
    logic when a player attempts to access trainer functionality, ensuring the correct
    trainer is selected based on proximity and availability. The result may be null
    if no suitable trainer is found within the search boundaries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Creature object representing the nearest trainer, or nullptr
    if no valid trainer is located in the vicinity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Creature* trainer = interactionManager->FindNearestTrainer();\nif (trainer)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with trainer interaction logic\n    player->GetSession()->SendTrainerList(trainer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "Creature* trainer = interactionManager->FindNearestTrainer();\nif (!trainer)\n\
      {\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"No trainer found nearby.\");\n    return;\n\
      }\nplayer->GetSession()->SendTrainerList(trainer);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal world object tracking and spatial queries.
    Performance may be impacted in densely populated areas with many NPCs. The search
    radius is typically limited to a predefined distance, which can vary depending
    on the implementation details of the NPCInteractionManager class.
  warnings: Ensure that the player's current location and the trainer's location are
    valid before calling this method, as invalid positions might lead to incorrect
    results or performance degradation. Also, be aware that the returned Creature
    pointer is not guaranteed to be in a valid state if it has been destroyed since
    the search was performed.
