  method: MaximizeLootFairness
  signature: void LootCoordination::MaximizeLootFairness(Group * group, uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Maximizes loot fairness within a group by redistributing items according
    to predefined rules.
  description: The MaximizeLootFairness method ensures that loot distribution among
    group members adheres to fairness principles, typically by re-evaluating and adjusting
    item assignments based on group dynamics and loot rules. This method is commonly
    invoked during group loot sessions to prevent situations where certain players
    receive disproportionately more or fewer items than others. It may involve recalculating
    loot priorities, redistributing unassigned items, or applying specific loot rules
    such as round-robin distribution or need-before-greed mechanics. The operation
    affects all active loot within the specified group and session context.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose loot fairness
      is being maximized. Must be a valid pointer; null pointers will result in undefined
      behavior.
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the current loot session. Used to track and
      manage specific loot events within the group context. Session IDs are typically
      generated by the server during loot initiation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Handler
    code: "void HandleLootSessionEnd(Group* group, uint32 sessionId)\n{\n    LootCoordination::MaximizeLootFairness(group,\
      \ sessionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Loot Rules
    code: "void ApplyFairnessRules(Player* player, Group* group, uint32 sessionId)\n\
      {\n    if (player->GetGroup() == group)\n    {\n        LootCoordination::MaximizeLootFairness(group,\
      \ sessionId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called at the end of a loot session or when group
    composition changes significantly. It may trigger additional processing steps
    such as updating player loot statistics or notifying clients about redistributed
    items.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null group pointer can lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the group and session ID are valid
    before invoking this function.
