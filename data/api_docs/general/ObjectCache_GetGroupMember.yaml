documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a Player object from the ObjectCache using the specified group
    member's GUID.
  description: The GetGroupMember method retrieves a Player object from the internal
    ObjectCache based on the provided GUID. This method is typically used within group
    or raid contexts to access specific player instances. The method performs a lookup
    in the cache and returns a pointer to the Player object if found, or nullptr if
    no matching player exists. It's important to note that this method assumes the
    GUID corresponds to a valid group member and does not perform validation checks
    on the input. The returned Player pointer should be used carefully as it may become
    invalid if the player leaves the group or disconnects from the server.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the group member to retrieve.
      This should be a valid player GUID that corresponds to an active group member
      in the current context.
  returns: A pointer to the Player object if a matching group member is found in the
    cache, or nullptr if no such member exists. The returned pointer is valid only
    as long as the player remains in the group and has not been removed from the cache.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetGroupMember
    code: "Player* player = ObjectCache::GetGroupMember(123456);\nif (player != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Player found, safe to use\n    player->SendPacket(...);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Player not found in cache\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetGroupMember in a group context
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n         itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n    {\n        Player* member = ObjectCache::GetGroupMember(itr->guid);\n\
      \        if (member && member->IsInWorld())\n        {\n            // Process\
      \ group member\n            member->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You are in a group!\"\
      );\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal ObjectCache to maintain valid references
    to players. The cache may not contain all players at all times, especially if
    they are not actively in the same map or zone. Developers should always check
    for null return values before using the returned Player pointer. Performance-wise,
    this lookup is generally fast as it uses hash-based lookups within the ObjectCache.
  warnings: Never assume that a non-null return value means the player is still valid
    or connected to the server. The player may have left the group, disconnected,
    or been removed from the cache. Always validate the returned pointer against nullptr
    and consider checking if the player is still in the world before using it.
