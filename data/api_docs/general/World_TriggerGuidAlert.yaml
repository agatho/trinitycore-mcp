documentation:
  brief: Triggers a GUID alert event for all connected players in the world.
  description: The TriggerGuidAlert method initiates a system-wide notification that
    alerts all currently connected players in the World of Warcraft realm about a
    specific GUID-related event or change. This method is typically used by the server
    to broadcast important information regarding object GUIDs, such as when a creature
    or game object's GUID has been updated or reassigned. The alert mechanism ensures
    that client-side systems are synchronized with the latest GUID information, preventing
    potential issues with object references and maintaining gameplay consistency across
    all active sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: World::instance()->TriggerGuidAlert();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all active sessions and sends a specific
    packet to each client to update their local GUID cache. It may be called during
    server initialization, object spawning, or when GUID reassignment occurs due to
    server maintenance or data synchronization.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could result in excessive network traffic
    or client-side performance degradation if triggered too frequently. Ensure that
    GUID alerts are only sent when necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead.
