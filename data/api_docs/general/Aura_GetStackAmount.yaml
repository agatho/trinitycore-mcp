  class: Aura
  method: GetStackAmount
  signature: uint8 Aura::GetStackAmount() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the aura.
  description: The GetStackAmount method returns the number of times an aura has been
    applied to a unit, which corresponds to the aura's stack size. In World of Warcraft
    mechanics, many spells and effects can be stacked, meaning they can be applied
    multiple times to the same target. Each application increases the stack count,
    and this method allows access to that value. The returned value is typically used
    for visual display in the user interface or for determining the effectiveness
    of certain abilities that scale with stacking.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the current stack amount of the aura. This value
    indicates how many times the aura has been applied to the target unit, and it
    can range from 0 (no stacks) up to the maximum allowed by the aura's definition.
  examples:
  - title: Check Aura Stacks Before Applying New Effect
    code: "if (Aura* aura = unit->GetAura(12345)) {\n    uint8 stacks = aura->GetStackAmount();\n\
      \    if (stacks < 5) {\n        // Apply new stack or refresh existing\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Stack Amount in Damage Calculation
    code: 'uint32 baseDamage = 100;

      uint8 stacks = aura->GetStackAmount();

      uint32 finalDamage = baseDamage * stacks;

      // Apply damage with stack-based multiplier'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation or checks on the aura itself;
    it simply returns the stored stack count. If the aura has been removed or is invalid,
    calling this method may return an unexpected value or cause undefined behavior
    if not properly checked.
  warnings: Ensure that the Aura object is valid before calling this method, as accessing
    a null or invalid aura's stack amount could lead to crashes or incorrect behavior
    in gameplay logic.
