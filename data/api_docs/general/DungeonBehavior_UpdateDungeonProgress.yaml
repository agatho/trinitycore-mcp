  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: UpdateDungeonProgress
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::UpdateDungeonProgress(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dungeon progress for a given group, tracking completion status
    and rewards.
  description: The UpdateDungeonProgress method is responsible for managing and updating
    the progression state of a dungeon instance for a specific group. It typically
    handles tracking which bosses have been defeated, updating quest objectives, awarding
    loot or experience, and ensuring that group members receive appropriate rewards
    based on their participation in the dungeon run. This method is commonly invoked
    during key events such as boss kills or when the group exits the dungeon. The
    implementation may also validate group composition and ensure all players meet
    prerequisites for progression updates.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon party whose
      progress is being updated. Must not be null and should represent a valid group
      currently inside a dungeon instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Completion Handler
    code: "void OnDungeonComplete(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        dungeonBehavior.UpdateDungeonProgress(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Progress After Boss Kill
    code: "void OnBossKill(Unit* boss, Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group && IsDungeonInstance(player->GetMap()))\n    {\n        dungeonBehavior.UpdateDungeonProgress(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal dungeon tracking systems and may
    modify group data structures such as quest progress or loot distribution. It's
    typically called during critical moments in the dungeon lifecycle, like boss defeat
    or exit from the instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and represents an active
    dungeon instance; otherwise, calling this method could result in undefined behavior
    or crashes.
