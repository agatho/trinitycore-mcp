  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateMarksmanshipState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the marksmanship state of the hunter, including aim, focus, and shot
    readiness.
  description: The UpdateMarksmanshipState method is responsible for managing and
    updating the internal state of a marksman hunter's combat readiness. This includes
    adjusting aim stability, focus levels, and determining whether the hunter is ready
    to fire their next shot. The method typically gets called during combat updates
    or when specific marksmanship abilities are triggered. It ensures that the hunter's
    marksmanship mechanics align with current game conditions such as target movement,
    distance, and player focus. This method may also handle cooldowns, resource management,
    and state transitions between different marksmanship phases like aiming, charging,
    or firing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ...\n    hunter->UpdateMarksmanshipState();\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom AI Logic
    code: "class MyHunterAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        // Perform\
      \ custom logic\n        if (player->IsInCombat())\n        {\n            hunterRefactored->UpdateMarksmanshipState();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game loop or AI system during
    combat updates. It may internally call other related methods such as UpdateAim(),
    UpdateFocus(), and CheckShotReadiness(). The implementation likely uses internal
    state flags to track whether the hunter is currently aiming, charging a shot,
    or in cooldown.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of combat contexts unless explicitly
    designed for pre-combat preparation. Improper invocation during non-combat may
    lead to inconsistent marksmanship states and unexpected behavior during actual
    encounters.
