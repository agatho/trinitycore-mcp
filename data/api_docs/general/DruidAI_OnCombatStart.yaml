  class: DruidAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void DruidAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes Druid AI behavior when entering combat with a target.
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a Druid AI unit begins combat
    with a target. This method sets up initial combat state, initializes any necessary
    variables, and prepares the AI for executing combat actions. It typically handles
    the setup of combat-related flags, target tracking, and may trigger initial spell
    or ability usage based on the Druid's class mechanics. The method is part of the
    standard TrinityCore AI framework and is called automatically by the core when
    combat begins.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that initiated combat. This parameter
      represents the enemy unit the Druid AI will engage with during combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom Druid AI implementation
    code: "class MyDruidAI : public DruidAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatStart(int*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Call base class implementation\n        DruidAI::OnCombatStart(target);\n\
      \        \n        // Custom combat initialization logic\n        if (target)\
      \ {\n            // Set up initial spell casting or behavior\n            DoCast(SPELL_MOONFIRE);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the TrinityCore AI system when a creature
    enters combat. Developers should ensure that any custom implementation properly
    calls the base class method to maintain proper AI behavior. The target parameter
    may be null in edge cases, so checking for validity is recommended.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the target pointer is not null before dereferencing
    it. Avoid performing heavy operations in this method as it's called frequently
    during combat transitions.
