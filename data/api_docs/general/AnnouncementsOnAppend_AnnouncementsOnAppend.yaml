  class: AnnouncementsOnAppend
  method: AnnouncementsOnAppend
  signature: void AnnouncementsOnAppend::AnnouncementsOnAppend(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes or appends announcement data for a specified GUID.
  description: The AnnouncementsOnAppend method is responsible for handling the initialization
    or appending of announcement-related data associated with a given global unique
    identifier (GUID). This method likely manages internal data structures or caches
    that store information about player-specific announcements, such as quest updates,
    server events, or system messages. It may be invoked during player login, when
    new announcements are received, or when a player's state changes in the game world.
    The method is typically part of a larger announcement system within TrinityCore
    that ensures players receive relevant notifications based on their GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player or entity for which
      announcement data is being initialized or appended. This value uniquely identifies
      the target in the game world and is typically a 32-bit integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Announcement Data for Player
    code: AnnouncementsOnAppend::AnnouncementsOnAppend(playerGuid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Append Announcement Data During Login Process
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    AnnouncementsOnAppend::AnnouncementsOnAppend(GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal announcement system and may interact
    with databases or caches to manage player-specific notifications. It should be
    called after a player has been authenticated but before they are fully logged
    into the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    entity in the game world, as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or
    memory access violations.
