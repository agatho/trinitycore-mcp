  class: MemoryLeakEntry
  method: MemoryLeakEntry
  signature: void MemoryLeakEntry::MemoryLeakEntry(void * addr, uint64_t sz, MemoryCategory
    cat, uint32_t guid, std::string ctx)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new memory leak entry with specified address, size, category,
    GUID, and context.
  description: The MemoryLeakEntry constructor initializes a memory leak tracking
    entry for debugging purposes. It stores information about a memory allocation
    including its address, size, category, associated object GUID, and contextual
    information. This is typically used in TrinityCore's memory leak detection system
    to track allocations that may not have been properly freed during shutdown or
    runtime. The method sets up internal state for tracking memory usage patterns
    and identifying potential memory leaks in the game server.
  parameters:
  - name: addr
    description: Pointer to the memory address that was allocated. This represents
      the base address of the allocated memory block.
  - name: sz
    description: Size of the allocated memory in bytes. Used to track how much memory
      was allocated at the given address.
  - name: cat
    description: Memory category enum value indicating the type or purpose of the
      allocation (e.g., object, packet, string).
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier of the associated game object or entity. Used to
      link memory allocations to specific in-game objects.
  - name: ctx
    description: Context string providing additional information about where and why
      the allocation occurred, useful for debugging.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Leak Entry Creation
    code: 'void* alloc_addr = malloc(1024);

      MemoryLeakEntry entry(alloc_addr, 1024, MEMORY_CATEGORY_OBJECT, 12345, "Player::UpdateAI");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by TrinityCore's memory tracking
    system. The MemoryLeakEntry objects are usually managed through a global memory
    leak tracker that monitors allocations during server runtime. The context string
    can be used to trace back allocation origins for debugging purposes.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the address parameter can lead to invalid memory access.
    Ensure that the address points to valid allocated memory before creating an entry.
    The GUID should correspond to an actual game object in the world to maintain proper
    tracking.
