    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of bot GUIDs sorted by their decision-making efficiency.
  description: The GetEfficientDecisionBots method returns a vector containing the
    unique identifiers (GUIDs) of AI bots, ordered from most to least efficient in
    making decisions. This ordering is typically based on performance metrics such
    as average response time or decision accuracy. The returned list can be used for
    load balancing, performance monitoring, or prioritizing bot resources. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple times. It assumes
    that the AIDecisionProfiler has already collected sufficient data about bot decision-making
    behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<uint32_t> containing the GUIDs of AI bots, sorted in descending
    order of decision-making efficiency. The vector may be empty if no bots have been
    profiled or if profiling data is unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Efficient Bots for Load Balancing
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> efficientBots = profiler.GetEfficientDecisionBots(5);\n\
      for (uint32_t botGuid : efficientBots)\n{\n    // Use the most efficient bots\
      \ first\n    printf(\"Bot GUID: %u\\n\", botGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on previously collected profiling data. If no decision-making
    performance metrics exist, an empty vector will be returned. The efficiency ranking
    may change dynamically as new data is gathered.
