  method: operator()
  signature: bool NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck::operator()(int * go)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a game object of specified type is within range and updates the
    nearest one.
  description: The operator() method of NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck is
    used to evaluate whether a game object of a specific type exists within a given
    range of an object. It serves as a predicate function for finding the nearest
    matching game object, typically used in AI or targeting logic. The method updates
    an internal reference to the closest game object that matches the criteria. This
    check is commonly employed in TrinityCore's pathfinding and targeting systems
    to locate nearby interactable objects such as chests, doors, or quest items.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid game object of the specified type was found within
    range and updates the internal reference; otherwise returns false if no matching
    object is in range.
  examples:
  - title: Finding the nearest chest within range
    code: "NearestGameObjectTypeInObjectRangeCheck check(player, GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CHEST,\
      \ 10.0f);\nif (check(&nearestChest)) {\n    // Process the nearest chest\n \
      \   player->InteractWith(nearestChest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other TrinityCore object
    searching utilities. It modifies internal state during execution and should be
    called only once per search cycle to avoid incorrect results.
  warnings: Ensure that the game object type being checked is valid and supported
    by the server's database; invalid types may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
