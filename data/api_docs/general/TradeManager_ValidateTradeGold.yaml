  class: TradeManager
  method: ValidateTradeGold
  signature: bool TradeManager::ValidateTradeGold(uint64 amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a specified gold amount is acceptable for trade.
  description: The ValidateTradeGold method checks if a given gold amount is valid
    for use in a trade transaction within the TrinityCore framework. This validation
    typically ensures that the amount does not exceed the player's available gold,
    is non-negative, and adheres to game rules such as maximum trade limits or currency
    restrictions. The method is commonly used during trade operations to prevent invalid
    or exploitative transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified gold amount is valid for trade; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (tradeManager.ValidateTradeGold(100000)) {\n    // Proceed with trade\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Valid gold amount for trade\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    // Reject trade\n    std::cout << \"Invalid gold amount\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player currency tracking and may
    enforce server-configured limits on maximum trade amounts. It is part of the core
    trading logic and should be called before finalizing any trade involving gold.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount passed to this method is properly sanitized and
    validated before calling, as invalid inputs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or exploits if not handled correctly at a higher level.
