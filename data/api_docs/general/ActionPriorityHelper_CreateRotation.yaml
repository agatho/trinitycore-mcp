  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: CreateRotation
  signature: PrioritizedAction ActionPriorityHelper::CreateRotation(uint32 spellId,
    int * target, float rotationPriority)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a prioritized action for spell casting based on provided
    parameters.
  description: The CreateRotation method constructs a PrioritizedAction object that
    encapsulates the logic for executing a specific spell within an AI rotation system.
    It takes a spell identifier, target information, and a priority value to determine
    how the action should be scheduled and executed in the context of a combat or
    non-combat scenario. This method is typically used by AI systems to manage spell
    casting order and timing based on game state conditions. The returned PrioritizedAction
    can be added to an action queue or processed immediately depending on the AI's
    decision-making framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cast. Must correspond to
      a valid spell in the game database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or GUID for the
      spell. Can be NULL if the spell does not require a specific target.
  - name: rotationPriority
    description: Floating-point value indicating the priority level of this action
      within the rotation sequence. Higher values indicate higher priority.
  returns: Returns a PrioritizedAction object containing the spell ID, target information,
    and priority that can be used to schedule or execute the spell in an AI rotation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CreateRotation
    code: 'PrioritizedAction action = ActionPriorityHelper::CreateRotation(12345,
      nullptr, 1.0f);

      // Creates a high-priority action for casting spell ID 12345 without a specific
      target'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a rotation with a target and custom priority
    code: 'int targetGuid = 67890;

      PrioritizedAction action = ActionPriorityHelper::CreateRotation(11223, &targetGuid,
      2.5f);

      // Creates an action for casting spell ID 11223 on target with GUID 67890 with
      medium-high priority'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI rotation system and should only be called within
    appropriate AI contexts. The target parameter may be NULL, but when provided,
    it must point to a valid game object identifier. Priority values are used for
    sorting actions in the rotation queue.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId corresponds to an actual spell in the database;
    otherwise, the action may fail silently or cause undefined behavior. Be cautious
    with target pointers as invalid references can lead to crashes.
