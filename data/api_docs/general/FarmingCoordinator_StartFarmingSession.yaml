  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: StartFarmingSession
  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::StartFarmingSession(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession, FarmingSessionType sessionType)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a farming session for a player with specified profession and session
    type.
  description: The StartFarmingSession method begins a new farming activity for a
    given player, utilizing their specified profession and session type. This method
    is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to manage player activities related to resource gathering or cultivation. It validates
    input parameters and ensures that the player can engage in the requested farming
    session. The method returns true upon successful initiation, or false if preconditions
    are not met such as invalid player reference, unsupported profession, or incompatible
    session type.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must be a valid pointer to an existing player in the game world.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of profession the player is
      using for farming. Valid values are defined by the ProfessionType enum, such
      as FARMING, MINING, HERBALISM, etc.
  - name: sessionType
    description: Enumeration value specifying the type of farming session to start.
      Defines whether it's a standard, extended, or special session. Values are defined
      by FarmingSessionType enum.
  returns: Returns true if the farming session was successfully initiated for the
    player with the given profession and session type; otherwise returns false if
    any precondition fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType prof = FARMING;\nFarmingSessionType\
      \ sessType = STANDARD_SESSION;\nbool result = coordinator.StartFarmingSession(&playerId,\
      \ prof, sessType);\nif (result) {\n    // Session started successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType prof = HERBALISM;\nFarmingSessionType\
      \ sessType = EXTENDED_SESSION;\nif (coordinator.StartFarmingSession(&playerId,\
      \ prof, sessType)) {\n    // Proceed with farming logic\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ session start failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to start farming session\
      \ for player %d\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object referenced by 'player' is already
    initialized and valid within the game world. The implementation may perform internal
    checks on profession validity and session compatibility before proceeding with
    session initiation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is not null and refers to an active
    player in the game world. Passing invalid or uninitialized pointers can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes.
