documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a group is disbanded in the game world
  description: The Hook_OnGroupDisband method is a callback function that gets executed
    whenever a player's group is disbanded. This typically occurs when the group leader
    removes all members from the group or when the group is automatically disbanded
    due to inactivity or other game mechanics. The method provides an opportunity
    for custom scripts or addons to perform cleanup operations, notify players, or
    modify game state upon group disbandment. It serves as a notification mechanism
    for developers who wish to extend or modify behavior during group lifecycle events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Group Disband Hook Implementation
    code: "class MyGroupHooks : public GroupHooks {\npublic:\n    void Hook_OnGroupDisband(Group*\
      \ group) override {\n        // Log group disband event\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Group with leader %u has been disbanded.\", group->GetLeaderGuid().GetCounter());\n\
      \        \n        // Perform cleanup operations\n        for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n             itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n        {\n            Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \            if (player)\n                player->SendNotification(\"Your group\
      \ has been disbanded.\");\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This hook is called after the group disband process is complete. The Group
    object passed to this method may still contain references to members, but they
    are no longer part of the active group structure. Developers should be aware that
    this hook might be invoked during server shutdown or when groups are destroyed,
    so any cleanup operations should be robust and not rely on other systems that
    may already be shutting down.
  warnings: This method is called during a critical point in the group lifecycle.
    Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls within this hook as it could
    impact game performance. Also, be cautious about modifying the group object directly
    since it's in a transitional state and further modifications might cause undefined
    behavior.
