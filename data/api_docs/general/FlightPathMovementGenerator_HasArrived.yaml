  method: HasArrived
  signature: bool FlightPathMovementGenerator::HasArrived() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a flight path movement generator has reached its destination.
  description: The HasArrived method checks if the FlightPathMovementGenerator has
    completed the flight path and reached its final destination. This method is typically
    used during movement updates to determine when a creature or player has finished
    flying along a predefined flight path. The implementation likely compares the
    current position against the destination coordinates or checks internal state
    flags indicating completion. This functionality is essential for proper flight
    path behavior in World of Warcraft, ensuring that NPCs and players transition
    correctly from flight mode back to ground movement or other states upon reaching
    their target location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the flight path has been fully traversed and the destination
    has been reached; otherwise returns false. The method may return false during
    active flight, even if the character is close to the destination, until the exact
    arrival point is confirmed.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Flight Path Completion
    code: "if (flightPathGenerator->HasArrived()) {\n    // Handle arrival logic\n\
      \    player->SetFacingTo(player->GetOrientation());\n    player->SendMoveSpline();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Flight Path Arrival Detection in AI
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (m_movementGenerator &&\
      \ m_movementGenerator->GetMovementGeneratorType() == FLIGHT_PATH_MOTION_TYPE)\
      \ {\n        if (FlightPathMovementGenerator* flightGen = dynamic_cast<FlightPathMovementGenerator*>(m_movementGenerator))\
      \ {\n            if (flightGen->HasArrived()) {\n                // Flight path\
      \ complete, transition to next behavior\n                DoNextBehavior();\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement system and should only be called on active
    flight path movement generators. The implementation likely involves coordinate
    comparison with tolerance thresholds to account for floating point precision issues
    during movement. It's important to note that this check might not immediately
    return true upon reaching the destination due to movement interpolation and synchronization
    delays in the game loop.
  warnings: Do not assume immediate arrival after reaching the final waypoint; the
    method may return false briefly even when visually at the destination. Calling
    HasArrived on a non-flight path movement generator will produce undefined behavior
    as it's designed specifically for flight path logic.
