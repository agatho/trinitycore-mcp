documentation:
  brief: Destroys the manager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for IManagerBase is responsible for cleaning up any
    resources allocated by the manager instance. As a virtual destructor, it ensures
    proper cleanup of derived class objects when deleted through a base class pointer.
    This method is automatically called during object destruction and should not be
    invoked manually. It typically handles deallocation of memory, closing of connections,
    or other necessary cleanup operations specific to the manager's implementation.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of manager instance
    code: 'IManagerBase* manager = new SomeDerivedManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Destructor called automatically here'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, which is essential for proper inheritance hierarchy
    cleanup. All derived managers should ensure their destructors are also virtual
    if they have virtual methods or are intended to be deleted through base class
    pointers.
