documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the composition of a dungeon group to determine optimal behavior
    strategies.
  description: The AnalyzeDungeonComposition method evaluates the current player group's
    makeup within a dungeon environment, assessing factors such as class distribution,
    role balance, and player levels. This analysis helps the AI system make informed
    decisions about tactical approaches, resource allocation, and encounter management
    during dungeon runs. The method is typically invoked at key moments such as group
    formation, before boss encounters, or when adjusting strategies mid-dungeon. It
    does not modify any state directly but prepares data structures that other methods
    can use for decision-making.

  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon AI
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEnterDungeon()\n{\n    m_behaviorManager.AnalyzeDungeonComposition();\n\
      \    // Proceed with strategy based on analysis\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the group composition is stable and before
    critical decisions are made. It may perform expensive computations depending on
    the number of players and complexity of the analysis.
