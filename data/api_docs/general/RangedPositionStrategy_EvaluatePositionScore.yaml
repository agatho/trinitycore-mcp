  class: RangedPositionStrategy
  method: EvaluatePositionScore
  signature: float RangedPositionStrategy::EvaluatePositionScore(const int & pos,
    Player * bot, Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a positional score for a bot's ranged attack position
    relative to target.
  description: The EvaluatePositionScore method calculates a numerical score representing
    how optimal a given position is for a bot to perform a ranged attack against a
    target. This score takes into account factors such as distance, line of sight,
    and potential threat from surrounding enemies. The method is typically used by
    AI systems to determine the best positioning strategy during combat. It's part
    of the RangedPositionStrategy class which handles logic specific to ranged unit
    positioning in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index or identifier to evaluate for ranged attack suitability.
      This typically represents a potential location on the battlefield where the
      bot could stand while attacking.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      whose positioning is being evaluated.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the target for the ranged
      attack. This could be an enemy player, NPC, or creature.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated positional score. Higher values
    indicate more optimal positions for ranged attacks, while lower values suggest
    less favorable positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float score = strategy.EvaluatePositionScore(5, bot, target);\nif (score\
      \ > 0.7f) {\n    // Move to position 5 for optimal ranged attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple positions
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nint bestPosition = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalPositions;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float currentScore = strategy.EvaluatePositionScore(i, bot, target);\n\
      \    if (currentScore > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = currentScore;\n  \
      \      bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for movement"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method is designed to be called frequently during combat AI decision-making
    cycles. It''s important to note that the actual scoring algorithm may consider
    various factors including but not limited to: distance to target, presence of
    obstacles, threat level from nearby enemies, and bot''s current health status.'
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'target' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method. Passing null or invalid pointers can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes in the AI system.
