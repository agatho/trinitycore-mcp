  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotSessionFactory::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot session factory, setting up required resources and configurations
    for creating and managing bot sessions.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotSessionFactory for use by allocating
    necessary resources, loading configuration settings, and establishing internal
    data structures needed to create and manage bot sessions. This method should be
    called once during system startup or when the bot system is first enabled. It
    ensures that all prerequisites are met before any bot sessions can be created.
    The initialization process may involve reading configuration files, setting up
    database connections, or allocating memory pools for bot-related operations. If
    initialization fails, subsequent attempts to create bot sessions will likely fail
    as well.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly set up; returns false if any error occurred during the initialization
    process, such as missing configuration files, failed resource allocation, or invalid
    settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotSessionFactory factory;\nbool success = factory.Initialize();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Bot sessions can now be created\n    std::cout << \"Bot session\
      \ factory initialized successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to initialize bot session\
      \ factory\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called only once during the application lifecycle.
    It's important to check the return value before attempting to create any bot sessions.
    The method may perform blocking operations during initialization, such as file
    I/O or database queries, so calling it from a critical thread path could impact
    performance.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup between calls
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that all previously created
    bot sessions are properly destroyed before calling Initialize again. The method
    assumes that the underlying system has sufficient resources available for initialization.
