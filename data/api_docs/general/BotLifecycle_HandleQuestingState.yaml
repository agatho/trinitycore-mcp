documentation:
  brief: Updates the questing state for all active bot characters in the game world.
  description: The HandleQuestingState method is responsible for managing and updating
    the questing behavior of bot characters within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method processes each active bot character's current quest objectives, checks
    for quest completion conditions, handles quest acceptance and surrender logic,
    and ensures that bots progress through their assigned quests according to predefined
    rules. It operates on a per-tick basis using the provided time difference parameter
    to determine when to perform quest-related updates. The method integrates with
    the core World of Warcraft quest system to maintain consistent bot behavior while
    respecting game mechanics such as quest gating, objective tracking, and reward
    distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in main update loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other updates ...\n    botLifecycle.HandleQuestingState(diff);\n\
      \    // ... more updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom bot AI system
    code: "class CustomBotAI {\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff) {\n        //\
      \ Perform bot-specific AI logic\n        botLifecycle.HandleQuestingState(diff);\n\
      \        // Continue with other bot behaviors\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game's main update loop to
    ensure proper quest progression for bots. The implementation likely uses internal
    bot state tracking and may involve database queries or cached quest data. Performance
    considerations include avoiding excessive processing of inactive bots, as this
    method may iterate through all active bot characters.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could result in bots getting stuck on
    quests or failing to complete objectives. Ensure that the diff parameter accurately
    represents elapsed time since last update to maintain proper timing behavior.
    This method should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without
    proper synchronization.
