  class: ItemTemplate
  method: GetDamageType
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetDamageType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the damage type associated with the item template.
  description: The GetDamageType method retrieves the damage type identifier that
    is assigned to an item template. This value determines how the item's damage is
    classified in the game engine, which affects various mechanics such as spell damage
    types, weapon damage classification, and resistance calculations. The returned
    value corresponds to predefined damage type constants used throughout TrinityCore's
    combat system. This method does not perform any validation or modification of
    internal state and simply returns the cached damage type value from the item template.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the damage type of the item. Common values
    include 0 for physical damage, 1 for holy damage, 2 for fire damage, 3 for nature
    damage, etc., depending on the game's damage type definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 damageType = itemTemplate->GetDamageType();

      printf("Item damage type: %u\n", damageType);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Damage Type for Weapon
    code: "ItemTemplate* weaponTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(54321);\nuint32\
      \ damageType = weaponTemplate->GetDamageType();\nif (damageType == 2) // Fire\
      \ damage\n{\n    printf(\"This weapon deals fire damage\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a cached value and does not perform any runtime computation.
    It is safe to call multiple times without performance impact. The damage type
    values are defined in the game's damage type constants, typically aligned with
    the SpellSchools enum in TrinityCore.
