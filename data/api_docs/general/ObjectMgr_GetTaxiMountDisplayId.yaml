  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetTaxiMountDisplayId
  signature: uint32 ObjectMgr::GetTaxiMountDisplayId(uint32 id, uint32 team, bool
    allowed_alt_team)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the display ID of a taxi mount for a given player team and mount
    ID.
  description: The GetTaxiMountDisplayId method retrieves the display ID of a taxi
    mount associated with a specific mount ID and player team. This function is used
    internally by the TrinityCore server to determine which visual mount model should
    be displayed when a player uses a taxi service. The method considers the player's
    team (Alliance or Horde) and whether alternative team mounts are allowed, returning
    the appropriate display ID for the taxi mount. It plays a crucial role in maintaining
    game consistency and visual accuracy during taxi travel.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the taxi mount entry in the database. This
      corresponds to entries in the taxi_mounts table or similar.
  - name: team
    description: The player's team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde). Determines
      which mount model is returned based on faction.
  - name: allowed_alt_team
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether alternative team mounts are permitted.
      When true, the method may return a mount from the opposing team if the primary
      team's mount is not available.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the display ID of the taxi mount model. If
    no valid mount is found for the given parameters, it typically returns 0, indicating
    an invalid or missing mount.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 mountDisplayId = sObjectMgr->GetTaxiMountDisplayId(12345, TEAM_ALLIANCE,
      true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining Mount for Horde Player
    code: "uint32 hordeMountId = sObjectMgr->GetTaxiMountDisplayId(67890, TEAM_HORDE,\
      \ false);\nif (hordeMountId != 0)\n{\n    // Use the mount display ID to set\
      \ up taxi travel\n    player->SetTaxiMountDisplayId(hordeMountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during taxi initialization or when setting
    up a player's mount for travel. It relies on internal data structures that map
    mount IDs to display IDs per team. The implementation may cache results for performance
    reasons, especially in high-traffic server environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided 'id' parameter corresponds to an actual entry
    in the database; otherwise, the method will return 0. Incorrectly handling the
    returned display ID can lead to visual glitches or missing mount models during
    taxi travel.
