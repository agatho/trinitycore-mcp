api:
  class: Player
  method: SetGuildRank
  signature: void Player::SetGuildRank(uint8 rankId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's guild rank to the specified rank ID.
  description: This method assigns a specific guild rank to the player, allowing control
    over their position within the guild hierarchy. The rank ID parameter determines
    the level of authority and permissions the player has within the guild. This functionality
    is essential for managing guild member roles and ensuring proper game mechanics
    during guild operations. The method directly affects the player's guild membership
    status and should be used carefully to maintain proper guild structure.
  parameters:
  - name: rankId
    description: The guild rank ID to assign to the player, ranging from 0 (initiate)
      to 10 (guild master). This value determines the player's permissions and role
      within the guild structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetGuildRank(5);

      // Sets the player to rank 5 (guild master)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint8 rank = 10;

      player->SetGuildRank(rank);

      // Assigns player to the highest guild rank (guild master)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used in conjunction with other guild-related methods
    to ensure proper guild member management. The rank ID must be within valid range
    (0-10) for proper functionality. Implementation involves updating internal guild
    data structures and may require synchronization if multiple players are involved.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect guild permissions, potentially
    causing issues with guild management and access control. Care should be taken
    when assigning ranks to avoid confusion in guild hierarchy.
