  class: EnhancedBotAIFactory
  method: CreateMonkAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateMonkAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Monk AI instance for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateMonkAI method is responsible for generating a specialized
    Artificial Intelligence behavior tailored for Monk class bots within the TrinityCore
    framework. This function allocates and configures the necessary AI components,
    including combat strategies, spell selection logic, and movement patterns specific
    to the Monk class. It ensures that the bot player can effectively perform actions
    such as using martial arts abilities, managing energy resources, and executing
    appropriate defensive and offensive tactics in various combat scenarios. The method
    typically integrates with the broader EnhancedBotAI system to maintain consistency
    across different class-specific AI implementations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically signifies successful creation, while non-zero
    values may indicate errors such as invalid player reference, memory allocation
    failure, or unsupported class configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Monk AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = factory->CreateMonkAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created for the monk bot\n    printf(\"Monk AI created successfully\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error condition\n    printf(\"Failed to create Monk\
      \ AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is a valid bot instance
    with appropriate class and level settings. The AI implementation may require additional
    initialization steps after calling this function to fully activate the Monk's
    behavior. Performance considerations should be noted as AI creation involves memory
    allocation and complex initialization logic.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-Monk player or an invalid Player pointer
    will likely result in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the bot player
    has been properly initialized with correct class data before invoking this function.
    The returned integer value should always be checked for error conditions.
