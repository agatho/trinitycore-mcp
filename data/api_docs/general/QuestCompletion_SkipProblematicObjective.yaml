  class: QuestCompletion
  method: SkipProblematicObjective
  signature: void QuestCompletion::SkipProblematicObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Skips a problematic quest objective for the specified player bot.
  description: The SkipProblematicObjective method is designed to bypass a specific
    quest objective that may be causing issues or impossibilities for a player bot.
    This functionality is typically used in automated quest completion systems where
    certain objectives might be unachievable due to game state, missing prerequisites,
    or other logical constraints. The method modifies the internal state of the quest
    completion process to mark the given objective as completed, effectively allowing
    the bot to progress through the quest without being blocked by that particular
    task.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the quest
      objective should be skipped. This parameter must not be null and should refer
      to a valid player instance.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective that needs to be skipped. The data within
      this structure determines how the objective is handled during the skip operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      QuestObjectiveData objData = ...; // Assume valid quest objective data

      QuestCompletion::SkipProblematicObjective(myBot, objData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an automated quest completion system and should only
    be called when it's determined that skipping the objective is safe and does not
    violate quest logic. It modifies internal quest state and may affect subsequent
    quest progression.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation can lead to quest state
    inconsistencies or unexpected behavior in the game. Ensure that skipping the objective
    doesn't break quest requirements or cause unintended consequences.
