  class: EconomyManager
  method: Reset
  signature: void EconomyManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the economy manager's internal state and clears all cached data.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the EconomyManager's
    internal state by clearing any cached data, resetting counters, and preparing
    the system for a fresh economy cycle. This method is typically invoked during
    server startup, world state transitions, or when administrative commands require
    a complete reset of economy-related systems. It ensures that all economy calculations
    and tracking start from a clean slate, preventing stale data from affecting gameplay
    mechanics such as auction house operations, currency distribution, or player transaction
    histories.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sWorld->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during safe periods in the game loop, such
    as during server initialization or world state changes, to avoid disrupting active
    player transactions. The reset operation is not thread-safe and must be executed
    on the main game thread.
  warnings: Calling Reset() while players are actively engaged in economy-related
    activities (e.g., auctions, trades) may lead to inconsistent data states or unexpected
    behavior. Always ensure that no active economy operations are in progress before
    invoking this method.
