  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: GetKnownFlightPaths
  signature: int NPCInteractionManager::GetKnownFlightPaths() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of flight paths known by the NPC interaction manager.
  description: The GetKnownFlightPaths method returns an integer value representing
    the total count of flight paths that are currently known to the NPC interaction
    manager. This typically corresponds to the number of flight points or destinations
    a player can access through an NPC, such as a flight master. The method does not
    take any parameters and is read-only in nature. It's commonly used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine what flight paths are
    available for interaction during NPC dialogues or quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of known flight paths. A return
    value of zero typically means no flight paths are known, while a positive integer
    indicates the count of available flight destinations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int flightPathCount = interactionManager.GetKnownFlightPaths();\nif (flightPathCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with displaying flight paths to player\n    printf(\"\
      Player can access %d flight paths.\\n\", flightPathCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger NPC interaction system and may be
    used in conjunction with other methods that retrieve specific flight path data
    or handle player movement. The returned count should be used to iterate through
    available flight paths, typically using an index-based approach.
