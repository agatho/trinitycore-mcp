  brief: Calculates the dodge chance from agility for the player.
  description: This method computes the dodge chance derived from agility for a player
    character. It returns two float values representing the diminishing and non-diminishing
    portions of dodge chance, which are calculated based on the player's current agility
    stat and game mechanics. The method is used internally by the game engine to determine
    player dodge chance when calculating combat statistics.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float diminishing = 0.0f;

      float nondiminishing = 0.0f;

      player->GetDodgeFromAgility(diminishing, nondiminishing);

      std::cout << "Diminishing: " << diminishing << " Nondiminishing: " << nondiminishing
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and requires accurate
    agility values to compute correct dodge chance. The calculation involves complex
    game mechanics including diminishing returns and base dodge chance from agility.
