  class: QuestValidation
  method: IsQuestAlreadyCompleted
  signature: bool QuestValidation::IsQuestAlreadyCompleted(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified quest has already been completed by the player.
  description: The IsQuestAlreadyCompleted method determines if a given quest ID has
    already been marked as completed for the specified player character. This function
    is typically used in quest validation logic to prevent duplicate quest completion
    or to check quest status before initiating quest-related actions. The method evaluates
    the player's quest log and completion status to return a boolean result indicating
    whether the quest is already finished. It relies on the internal quest tracking
    system of TrinityCore to maintain accurate quest state information.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest to check for completion status.
      This value must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      completion status is being checked. The player must be valid and connected to
      the server.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest has already been completed by the player,
    false otherwise. The method will return false if the quest ID does not exist or
    if the player has not yet completed the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Check
    code: "if (QuestValidation::IsQuestAlreadyCompleted(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Quest already completed\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Quest\
      \ already completed.\");\n} else {\n    // Quest not yet completed\n    player->AddQuestReward(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Giver Logic
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature) {\n    if (QuestValidation::IsQuestAlreadyCompleted(67890,\
      \ player)) {\n        // Show completed quest dialog\n        creature->Whisper(\"\
      You have already completed this quest.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL, player);\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Offer quest\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->GetGossipMenu().AddMenuItem(-1,\
      \ 0, \"Accept Quest\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the player's quest log and relies on the
    internal state management of TrinityCore. It is recommended to cache results for
    frequently checked quests to improve performance. The method assumes that the
    Player object passed is valid and properly initialized within the game context.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also note that quest
    completion status may change during gameplay, so results should be re-evaluated
    if quest state can be modified externally.
