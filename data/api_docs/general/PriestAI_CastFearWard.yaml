  signature: void PriestAI::CastFearWard()
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Fear Ward spell on the current target.
  description: The CastFearWard method is responsible for executing the Fear Ward
    spell cast by a Priest AI instance. This spell provides protection against fear
    effects and can be used to mitigate or prevent fear-based crowd control abilities
    from affecting the priest or nearby allies. The method typically checks if the
    spell is available, validates the target conditions, and initiates the spell casting
    process within the AI's action queue. It may also handle cooldowns and resource
    requirements for the spell.

  - title: Basic usage in Priest AI context
    code: "void SomePriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->getVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        if (me->IsWithinMeleeRange(target))\n        {\n           \
      \ CastFearWard();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Priest AI behavior system and should only be called
    when the AI has a valid target and appropriate conditions are met. The spell casting
    process includes checking for spell availability, target validity, and ensuring
    the priest has sufficient mana or other resources required to cast Fear Ward.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI instance is properly initialized and has a valid target
    before calling this method. Improper usage may result in failed spell casts or
    unexpected behavior in combat scenarios.
