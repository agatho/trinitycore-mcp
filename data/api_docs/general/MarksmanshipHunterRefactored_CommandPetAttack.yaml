  method: CommandPetAttack
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::CommandPetAttack(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to attack a target.
  description: The CommandPetAttack method initiates an attack command for the hunter's
    summoned pet, instructing it to engage a specified target. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with pet management systems within the Marksmanship Hunter
    class to control pet behavior during combat. The method does not directly handle
    target selection but rather executes the attack command on whatever target the
    pet currently has selected or is commanded to attack. It is part of the core pet
    AI functionality and relies on proper pet state management for correct operation.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents the target
      identifier or command type for the pet's attack action. The exact meaning depends
      on internal implementation but typically corresponds to a valid GameObject or
      Unit GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Attack Command
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunter;

      int targetGuid = 12345;

      hunter.CommandPetAttack(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the pet is already summoned and in a valid state
    for receiving attack commands. The parameter should point to a valid target GUID;
    otherwise, behavior may be undefined or result in no action being taken.
  warnings: Using an invalid or null pointer for param0 may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target exists and is valid before calling this method.
