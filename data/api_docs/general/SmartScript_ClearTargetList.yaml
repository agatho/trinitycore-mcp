  signature: void SmartScript::ClearTargetList(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the target list for a specified smart script ID
  description: The ClearTargetList method removes all targets from the target list
    associated with a given smart script ID. This function is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore AI system to reset or clear previously set target references
    for scripted events. The method operates on the SmartScript class which handles
    AI behavior for creatures, game objects, and other entities within the game world.
    It ensures that any previous targeting data is cleared before new targets are
    assigned.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the smart script whose target list should
      be cleared. This ID corresponds to a specific AI script instance in the TrinityCore
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing targets for a specific smart script
    code: "SmartScript* script = sSmartScriptMgr->GetScriptById(12345);\nif (script)\n\
      {\n    script->ClearTargetList(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ClearTargetList in a combat AI context
    code: "void OnCombatBegin(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Clear any existing targets\n \
      \   ClearTargetList(me->GetEntry());\n    \n    // Set new targets\n    AddTarget(who);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartScript system which is used extensively in
    TrinityCore for creating complex AI behaviors. The target list clearing operation
    is typically performed before setting new targets to prevent conflicts or unintended
    targeting behavior. This function should be called carefully as it may affect
    active AI routines that depend on existing target data.
  warnings: Calling ClearTargetList while an AI script is actively processing targets
    may cause unexpected behavior or crashes if the script tries to access cleared
    target data. Always ensure proper synchronization when modifying target lists
    during active AI execution.
