  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: EndTick
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::EndTick(uint32 currentTime, uint32 botsUpdated,
    uint32 botsSkipped)
documentation:
  brief: Records the end of a performance monitoring tick for bot processing
  description: The EndTick method is used to finalize performance measurements for
    a single tick of the bot system. It logs timing information and updates internal
    statistics based on the number of bots processed and skipped during the current
    tick. This method is typically called at the end of each tick cycle to maintain
    accurate performance metrics for bot behavior and system efficiency. The method
    does not return any value but updates internal monitoring state that can be queried
    later.
  parameters:
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current timestamp in milliseconds when this tick ended, used
      to calculate elapsed time for the processing cycle
  - name: botsUpdated
    description: The number of bots that were successfully updated during this tick
      cycle
  - name: botsSkipped
    description: The number of bots that were skipped during this tick cycle, typically
      due to resource constraints or other conditions
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot tick processing
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateBots()\n{\n    uint32 startTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    // ... bot update logic ...\n    uint32 botsUpdated = 15;\n    uint32 botsSkipped\
      \ = 3;\n    sBotPerformanceMonitor->EndTick(startTime, botsUpdated, botsSkipped);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called at the end of each bot tick cycle to ensure
    accurate performance monitoring. The timing information is used for calculating
    average processing times and identifying potential bottlenecks in bot behavior.
