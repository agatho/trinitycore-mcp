api:
  class: MovementAction
  method: GeneratePath
  signature: bool MovementAction::GeneratePath(BotAI * ai, float x, float y, float
    z)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a movement path for the bot AI to navigate to a specified location.
  description: The GeneratePath method calculates and stores a navigation path for
    a bot AI instance, allowing it to move toward a given set of coordinates (x, y,
    z). This method is typically used in conjunction with movement actions within
    the TrinityCore AI framework. It leverages the underlying navigation system to
    determine a valid route from the bot's current position to the target location,
    considering obstacles and terrain. The path generation process may involve querying
    the game's navigation mesh or waypoint system to ensure realistic and feasible
    movement. This method is essential for bots that need to perform complex navigation
    tasks such as following players, moving to specific locations, or avoiding collisions
    during movement.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will execute the generated path.
      Must not be null.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the target location in world space.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the target location in world space.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the target location in world space.
  returns: Returns true if the path was successfully generated and stored for later
    execution, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the destination
    is unreachable or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Generation
    code: "BotAI* ai = ...; // Assume valid BotAI instance\nfloat targetX = 100.0f;\n\
      float targetY = 200.0f;\nfloat targetZ = 50.0f;\nbool success = ai->GeneratePath(ai,\
      \ targetX, targetY, targetZ);\nif (success) {\n    // Path is ready for execution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Generation with Error Handling
    code: "BotAI* ai = ...;\nfloat x = 100.0f, y = 200.0f, z = 50.0f;\nif (!ai->GeneratePath(ai,\
      \ x, y, z)) {\n    // Handle path generation failure\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to generate path to (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\", x, y, z);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation system of TrinityCore and
    may be affected by the availability and accuracy of the navigation mesh. The path
    generated is typically stored internally within the BotAI instance for subsequent
    execution. For performance reasons, it's recommended to avoid frequent calls to
    this method unless necessary.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided coordinates are valid and within the bounds of
    the current map. Invalid or unreachable destinations may cause the method to return
    false, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.
