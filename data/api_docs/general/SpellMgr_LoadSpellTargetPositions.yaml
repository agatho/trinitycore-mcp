documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell target position data from the database into memory
    for use during spell execution.
  description: The LoadSpellTargetPositions method is responsible for retrieving all
    spell target position records from the database and loading them into internal
    memory structures within the SpellMgr class. This data includes coordinates and
    orientation information that spells may require when targeting specific locations
    rather than units. The method typically executes during server startup or database
    reload operations to ensure that all spell targeting mechanics have access to
    up-to-date positional data. It performs necessary validation and error handling
    to prevent invalid or malformed position data from being loaded into the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellSystem()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellTargetPositions();\n\
      \    // Spell target positions are now available for spell execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup sequence and should
    not be called repeatedly during runtime unless database schema changes require
    a reload. The loaded data is cached in memory for fast access during spell casting
    operations, so any modifications to the underlying database records will require
    a full reload of this data structure.
  warnings: Calling this method while spells are actively being cast may lead to inconsistent
    behavior or crashes if spell execution threads attempt to access position data
    that is currently being modified. This method should only be called during safe
    initialization or shutdown phases.
