documentation:
  brief: Teleports the player to their bind location
  description: The Recall method triggers a teleportation to the player's bind location,
    which is typically their corpse or the location where they died. This method is
    commonly used in conjunction with the recall command in-game to quickly return
    to the player's last saved location. The action occurs immediately without any
    delay or animation, and it can be used to bypass certain game mechanics such as
    being in combat or having a death penalty.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->Recall();'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: The method internally uses the player''s saved location
    data and triggers a teleportation to that position. It is often used in combination
    with other methods like ''TeleportTo'' or ''SaveToDB''. Performance considerations:
    This method does not involve any significant computational overhead, but may be
    affected by server-side delays if the player''s location has changed since last
    save.'
  warnings: 'This method should not be used during combat as it will cause the player
    to immediately exit combat state. Common mistake: Using this method when the player
    is already at their bind location or in a zone where they cannot recall, which
    may result in no effect or unexpected behavior.'
