  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeMovementOptimization
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeMovementOptimization(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotPerformanceProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and optimizes bot movement behavior based on performance profiling
    data.
  description: The AnalyzeMovementOptimization method evaluates the movement patterns
    and efficiency of a specified bot identified by its GUID. It processes the provided
    performance profile to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the
    bot's navigation logic, pathfinding algorithms, or movement execution. This method
    is typically invoked during performance tuning sessions or when adjusting bot
    behavior for optimal gameplay experience. The analysis may involve examining factors
    such as path length, traversal time, collision avoidance, and resource utilization
    during movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose movement optimization
      is to be analyzed. Must correspond to a valid active bot within the TrinityCore
      instance.
  - name: profile
    description: A reference to a BotPerformanceProfile object containing performance
      metrics and behavioral data for the specified bot. This profile is updated with
      analysis results after the method execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Optimization Analysis
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      botAnalytics.AnalyzeMovementOptimization(botGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Profile Inspection
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = GetActiveBotGUID();\nBotPerformanceProfile profile;\n\
      botAnalytics.AnalyzeMovementOptimization(botGuid, profile);\nif (profile.GetMovementEfficiency()\
      \ < 0.7f) {\n    // Trigger movement optimization logic\n    LOG_INFO(\"ai\"\
      , \"Bot {} has low movement efficiency, applying optimizations.\", botGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot identified by botGuid is currently active
    and registered within the TrinityCore AI system. The BotPerformanceProfile object
    must be properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
    Performance impact may vary depending on the complexity of the bot's movement
    patterns.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or inactive bot GUID will likely
    result in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the profile parameter
    is valid and properly allocated before invoking this method.
