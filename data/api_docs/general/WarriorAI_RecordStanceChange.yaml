  class: WarriorAI
  method: RecordStanceChange
  signature: void WarriorAI::RecordStanceChange(WarriorStance fromStance, WarriorStance
    toStance)
documentation:
  brief: Records a warrior's stance change from one stance to another for AI tracking
    purposes.
  description: The RecordStanceChange method logs the transition of a warrior character
    from one combat stance to another within the TrinityCore AI system. This method
    is typically invoked when a warrior switches between Battle Stance, Defensive
    Stance, or Berserker Stance during combat. The recorded stance changes are used
    by the AI for decision-making processes, behavior tracking, and potential future
    strategic planning. The method does not perform any direct stance switching itself
    but merely records the transition for internal AI state management.
  parameters:
  - name: fromStance
    description: The warrior's current stance before the change. Valid values are
      WarriorStance::STANCE_BATTLE, WarriorStance::STANCE_DEFENSIVE, or WarriorStance::STANCE_BERSERKER.
  - name: toStance
    description: The warrior's new stance after the change. Valid values are WarriorStance::STANCE_BATTLE,
      WarriorStance::STANCE_DEFENSIVE, or WarriorStance::STANCE_BERSERKER.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a stance transition
    code: 'WarriorAI* ai = reinterpret_cast<WarriorAI*>(unit->GetAI());

      ai->RecordStanceChange(WarriorStance::STANCE_BATTLE, WarriorStance::STANCE_DEFENSIVE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking stance changes in combat logic
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* target) override\n{\n    if (me->GetShapeshiftForm()\
      \ == FORM_BATTLE_STANCE)\n    {\n        RecordStanceChange(WarriorStance::STANCE_BATTLE,\
      \ WarriorStance::STANCE_DEFENSIVE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI state tracking system and should only
    be called when an actual stance change occurs. The method does not validate the
    transition logic; it simply records the change. It's recommended to call this
    method immediately after a stance change operation to maintain accurate AI state.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that a real stance change has
    occurred, as it may lead to incorrect AI behavior tracking. This method should
    only be used within the context of warrior AI logic and not for general stance
    management.
