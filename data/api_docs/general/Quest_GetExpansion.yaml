documentation:
  brief: Returns the expansion ID associated with the quest
  description: The GetExpansion method retrieves the expansion ID that defines the
    game expansion to which a specific quest belongs. This is crucial for determining
    compatibility and content availability in World of Warcraft, particularly when
    dealing with quests from different expansion packs such as Vanilla, Burning Crusade,
    Wrath of the Lich King, and others. The method returns an integer value representing
    the expansion ID, which can be used to filter or categorize quests based on their
    source expansion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the expansion ID of the quest. Values typically
    correspond to expansion IDs like 0 for Vanilla, 1 for Burning Crusade, 2 for Wrath
    of the Lich King, and so forth. The method returns -1 if the quest is not associated
    with any expansion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int32 expansionId = quest->GetExpansion();

  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and relies on internal quest data
    structures. It should be used carefully when filtering quests by expansion to
    ensure proper compatibility with game mechanics.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other quest-related
    functions; incorrect use may lead to mismatched expansion IDs or invalid quest
    data retrieval.
