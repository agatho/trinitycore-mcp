  class: Map
  method: markCell
  signature: void Map::markCell(uint32 pCellId)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a specific cell on the map for update or processing.
  description: The markCell method is used to flag a particular cell within the Map's
    grid system for subsequent processing or updates. This functionality is typically
    employed in the context of dynamic world object management, where certain cells
    need to be re-evaluated or refreshed during game ticks. The method likely sets
    an internal flag or bit within the map's cell data structure to indicate that
    the specified cell requires attention. This is commonly used for handling player
    movement, object visibility updates, or other time-based events that require periodic
    processing of specific grid areas.
  parameters:
  - name: pCellId
    description: The unique identifier of the cell to be marked. This represents a
      specific grid cell within the map's coordinate system, typically calculated
      from world coordinates using the map's cell size parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Cell for Update
    code: 'uint32 cellId = map->GetCellId(x, y);

      map->markCell(cellId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Marking Multiple Cells
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    uint32 cellId = map->GetCellId(x +\
      \ i, y + i);\n    map->markCell(cellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the map's internal grid management system and
    may be called automatically by the core when objects enter or leave cells. The
    marking mechanism probably uses bit flags or similar efficient data structures
    to minimize memory overhead. It's important to note that marking a cell does not
    immediately trigger processing; it simply flags the cell for later handling during
    the next update cycle.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid cell ID may result in undefined behavior
    or corruption of internal map data structures. Ensure that the provided cell ID
    is valid and corresponds to an actual cell within the map's grid boundaries. This
    method should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization.
