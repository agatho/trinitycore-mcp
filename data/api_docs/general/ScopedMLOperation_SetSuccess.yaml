  class: ScopedMLOperation
  method: SetSuccess
  signature: void ScopedMLOperation::SetSuccess(bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the success status of the scoped ML operation.
  description: The SetSuccess method is used to indicate whether a scoped machine
    learning operation has completed successfully or encountered an error. This method
    updates an internal flag within the ScopedMLOperation object that can be queried
    later to determine the outcome of the operation. The method is typically called
    by the operation's implementation code after attempting to execute a machine learning
    task, such as model training or inference, to signal its completion status to
    the calling code or parent context.
  parameters:
  - name: success
    description: A boolean value indicating the success status of the operation. True
      indicates successful completion, false indicates failure or error.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Success Status to True
    code: 'ScopedMLOperation operation;

      // ... perform ML operation ...

      operation.SetSuccess(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Success Status to False on Error
    code: "ScopedMLOperation operation;\ntry {\n    // ... perform ML operation ...\n\
      \    operation.SetSuccess(true);\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    operation.SetSuccess(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other ScopedMLOperation
    methods to manage the lifecycle of machine learning operations. It's important
    to call this method before the object goes out of scope if the success status
    needs to be preserved for later retrieval.
  warnings: Calling SetSuccess multiple times on the same ScopedMLOperation instance
    may lead to unexpected behavior or overwrite previous success states. Ensure that
    this method is called exactly once per operation lifecycle.
