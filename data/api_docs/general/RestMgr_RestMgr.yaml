  method: RestMgr
  signature: void RestMgr::RestMgr(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a RestMgr instance for the specified player, setting up internal
    state for rest-related operations.
  description: The RestMgr constructor initializes a new instance of the RestMgr class
    for a given player. This method sets up the internal state required to manage
    player rest mechanics, including tracking rest status, energy levels, and related
    game mechanics. The initialization typically occurs when a player enters a rested
    area or when the player's rest state needs to be managed by the system. This constructor
    is not meant to be called directly by external code but rather through the appropriate
    subsystems that handle player rest management.

  examples:
  - title: Basic RestMgr Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      RestMgr* restMgr = new RestMgr(player);

      // The RestMgr is now initialized for this player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore subsystems
    when managing player states. Developers should not instantiate RestMgr objects
    directly unless implementing custom rest mechanics. The class likely maintains
    internal references to player data and game state that are initialized during
    construction.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of RestMgr should be avoided unless you understand
    the full implications of the internal state management. Improper use may lead
    to inconsistent player states or memory leaks. This constructor does not perform
    any validation on the input player pointer.
