  method: SetUncompressed
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetUncompressed()
documentation:
  brief: Enables uncompressed movement spline data for the spline initialization.
  description: The SetUncompressed method configures the MoveSplineInit object to
    use uncompressed spline data format. This is typically used when precise control
    over movement path data is required, such as during custom movement behaviors
    or when integrating with external pathfinding systems. The method modifies internal
    state flags to indicate that subsequent spline calculations should not apply compression
    algorithms to the movement data. This can be important for maintaining accuracy
    in specific game mechanics like precise NPC movement or custom player animations.

  - title: Basic Usage in Movement Initialization
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      init.SetUncompressed();

      // Subsequent spline operations will use uncompressed data

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any movement data is added to the spline.
    The uncompressed format typically consumes more memory and bandwidth compared
    to compressed formats, so it should only be used when necessary for precision
    requirements.
