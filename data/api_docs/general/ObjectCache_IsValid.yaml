documentation:
  brief: Checks if the object cache entry is still valid based on current time
  description: The IsValid method determines whether an object cache entry remains
    valid by comparing its expiration timestamp against the provided current time.
    This method is typically used to ensure that cached objects haven't expired and
    are still usable within the game world. The validation process checks if the cache
    entry's lifetime has not yet elapsed, returning true if it's still valid or false
    if it should be refreshed or discarded. This mechanism helps maintain performance
    by preventing access to stale cached data while ensuring that frequently accessed
    objects remain available.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object cache entry is still valid (not expired) based
    on the current time, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (cacheEntry.IsValid(WorldTimer::GetGameTimeMS())) {\n    // Use cached\
      \ object\n    ProcessCachedObject();\n} else {\n    // Refresh cache\n    RefreshCache();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with object lifecycle management
    code: "void UpdateObjectCache(ObjectCache& cache) {\n    uint32 currentTime =\
      \ WorldTimer::GetGameTimeMS();\n    if (!cache.IsValid(currentTime)) {\n   \
      \     cache.Refresh();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal timestamp tracking of the ObjectCache
    instance. The validity check is typically performed in high-frequency loops, so
    performance is important. Cache entries should be validated before use to prevent
    accessing stale data that could cause game state inconsistencies.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper cache management may lead to using
    expired cached objects, which can cause unexpected behavior or crashes. Always
    validate cache entries before accessing their contents.
