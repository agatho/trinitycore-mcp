  class: PlayerProfile
  method: PlayerProfile
  signature: void PlayerProfile::PlayerProfile(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a player profile with the specified unique identifier.
  description: The PlayerProfile constructor initializes a player profile object using
    the provided global unique identifier (GUID). This method sets up internal data
    structures and references needed to manage player-specific information within
    the TrinityCore framework. The GUID parameter uniquely identifies the player across
    the game world and is essential for retrieving and managing player data. This
    constructor typically gets called when loading or creating a new player profile
    instance, ensuring proper initialization of all profile-related attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player. This value uniquely
      identifies the player within the TrinityCore database and is used to retrieve
      player-specific data from storage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PlayerProfile Initialization
    code: 'PlayerProfile profile(12345);

      // Initializes a new player profile with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using PlayerProfile in Player Loading Context
    code: "void LoadPlayerFromDB(uint32 playerGuid)\n{\n    PlayerProfile profile(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // Profile is now initialized with the player's GUID\n    // Additional\
      \ loading logic can proceed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs database lookups or memory allocations to
    initialize player-specific data structures. It should be called only when a valid
    player GUID is available, as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or database
    errors.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with an invalid or uninitialized GUID value.
    The method assumes the GUID refers to an existing player in the database and does
    not validate its existence before proceeding with initialization.
