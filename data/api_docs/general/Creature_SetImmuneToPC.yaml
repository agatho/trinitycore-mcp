documentation:
  brief: Sets the creature's immunity to player characters.
  description: This method controls whether a creature is immune to player character
    attacks, effectively preventing it from being targeted or attacked by players.
    It is commonly used in scenarios where creatures need to be protected from player
    interaction, such as during quest events or when the creature should not be engaged
    in combat with players. The method modifies the creature's flags to reflect this
    immunity state.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetImmuneToPC(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature)\n{\n    creature->SetImmuneToPC(true);\n\
      }\n// This prevents player interaction with the creature during a quest event"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the creature's flags internally and should be used carefully
    in scenarios where player interaction is expected. The immunity state can be toggled
    on/off depending on the context, and it may affect how the creature interacts
    with player-controlled units.
