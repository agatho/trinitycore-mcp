  brief: Processes a party uninvite request from a player to remove another player
    from their party
  description: The HandlePartyUninviteOpcode method handles the client-side packet
    sent when a player attempts to remove another player from their current party
    or raid group. This method validates the requesting player's permissions, checks
    if the target player exists in the party, and ensures proper party mechanics are
    maintained. The method performs necessary cleanup operations such as updating
    party member lists, sending notifications to affected players, and maintaining
    group integrity. It also handles edge cases like attempting to uninvite players
    who are not in the party or when the requesting player lacks sufficient permissions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Party Uninvite Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePartyUninviteOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::PartyUninvite&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player || !player->GetGroup())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Validate that the player is in a group and has\
      \ permission to remove members\n    if (player->GetGroup()->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with uninviting target player from party\n      \
      \  player->GetGroup()->RemoveMember(packet.TargetGuid);\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet handling system and operates
    within the context of WorldSession. The implementation assumes that proper authentication
    and authorization checks have already been performed before this method is invoked.
    It relies on the Group class to manage party state and member management.
  warnings: Improper handling of party uninvites can lead to inconsistent group states,
    potential crashes if invalid GUIDs are passed, or security vulnerabilities if
    permission checks are bypassed. Always validate that the requesting player has
    sufficient permissions before proceeding with the uninvite operation.
