documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot state and processes any pending loot operations for the
    associated object.
  description: The Loot::Update method is responsible for managing the internal state
    of a loot object, ensuring that all pending loot operations are processed and
    that the loot data remains synchronized with the game world. This typically involves
    updating the loot's visibility, handling item distribution to players, and cleaning
    up expired or consumed loot. The method may also trigger notifications to nearby
    players about new loot availability or changes in loot status. It is commonly
    called during game loop iterations or when specific events occur that require
    loot state synchronization.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();

      loot->Update();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update in Game Loop Context
    code: "void UpdateWorldObjects()\n{\n    for (auto& obj : WorldObjects)\n    {\n\
      \        if (obj->GetLoot())\n            obj->GetLoot()->Update();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called frequently during the game loop to
    ensure proper loot state management. It may perform operations that involve database
    access or network communication, so performance considerations should be taken
    into account when calling it in high-frequency scenarios.
