  class: IResourceSystem
  method: GetSecondaryPercent
  signature: float IResourceSystem::GetSecondaryPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the secondary resource percentage value for the system.
  description: The GetSecondaryPercent method retrieves the current percentage value
    of a secondary resource, which is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    to represent resources like mana, rage, energy, or focus. This value typically
    ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents no resource and 1.0 represents full
    resource capacity. The method does not modify any state and is purely informational,
    making it safe to call during gameplay loops or UI updates. It's often used in
    conjunction with other resource management methods to provide accurate visual
    feedback to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the secondary resource percentage, typically
    between 0.0 (no resource) and 1.0 (full resource). Returns 0.0 if the system has
    no secondary resource or is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float percent = resourceSystem->GetSecondaryPercent();\nif (percent > 0.5f)\n\
      {\n    // Display full resource bar\n    resourceBar->SetFill(1.0f);\n}\nelse\
      \ if (percent > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Display partial resource bar\n    resourceBar->SetFill(percent);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Resource Management
    code: "class PlayerResourceHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdatePlayerUI()\n  \
      \  {\n        float secondaryPercent = player->GetResourceSystem()->GetSecondaryPercent();\n\
      \        \n        // Update UI elements based on resource level\n        if\
      \ (secondaryPercent <= 0.2f)\n        {\n            uiManager->ShowLowResourceWarning();\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            uiManager->HideLowResourceWarning();\n\
      \        }\n        \n        resourceDisplay->SetPercentage(secondaryPercent);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with primary resource management
    systems and may be called frequently during gameplay. The returned value should
    not be modified directly as it's a read-only representation of the current resource
    state. Performance is generally good since this is a simple getter method, but
    frequent calls in tight loops should still be considered for optimization.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized resource
    system may return unexpected values. Always validate the resource system instance
    before calling this method to prevent potential crashes or incorrect behavior.
