  method: InterpolateAlongPath
  signature: int PathfindingUtils::InterpolateAlongPath(const int & waypoints, float
    distance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the index of the waypoint along a path that is closest
    to a specified distance from the start.
  description: The InterpolateAlongPath method determines the waypoint index on a
    given path that corresponds to a specific distance traveled from the beginning
    of the path. This utility is commonly used in pathfinding systems for positioning
    units or objects along a predefined route at calculated intervals. The method
    takes into account the total length of the path and interpolates between waypoints
    based on the provided distance parameter. It assumes that the path has been precomputed
    and that waypoints are ordered sequentially from start to finish. The result is
    an integer index pointing to the appropriate waypoint in the path array.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: A reference to an integer representing the total number of waypoints
      in the path. This value determines the valid range for the returned index, which
      will be between 0 and (waypoints - 1).
  - name: distance
    description: A floating-point value indicating the distance along the path from
      the starting point. This parameter is used to determine which waypoint is closest
      to that distance.
  returns: An integer representing the index of the waypoint in the path that corresponds
    to the specified distance. Returns -1 if the input parameters are invalid or out
    of bounds, such as when distance is negative or exceeds the total path length.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find waypoint at half path distance
    code: 'int waypoints = 5;

      float halfPathDistance = 10.0f;

      int result = PathfindingUtils::InterpolateAlongPath(waypoints, halfPathDistance);

      // Returns index of the waypoint closest to 10 units from start

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic path length calculation
    code: 'int totalWaypoints = path.GetWaypointCount();

      float fullPathLength = CalculatePathLength(path);

      float desiredDistance = fullPathLength * 0.75f; // 75% along the path

      int waypointIndex = PathfindingUtils::InterpolateAlongPath(totalWaypoints, desiredDistance);

      // Returns index of the waypoint at 75% of total path length

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other pathfinding utilities
    to smoothly move units along a calculated route. It does not perform actual movement
    but rather calculates positioning based on distance along the path. The method
    assumes that waypoints are evenly spaced or that interpolation logic handles irregular
    spacing internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'waypoints' parameter accurately reflects the number of
    waypoints in the current path to avoid out-of-bounds access. Passing a negative
    distance may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results depending on implementation
    details.
