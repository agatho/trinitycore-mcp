documentation:
  brief: Processes a quest greeting request from a quest giver NPC, initiating the
    quest interaction sequence.
  description: The HandleQuestgiverHelloOpcode method is invoked when a player interacts
    with a quest giver NPC by clicking on them. This method handles the initial packet
    sent by the client to begin a quest interaction, typically triggered after the
    player selects 'Talk' or 'Hello' with an NPC that has active quests. It retrieves
    the quest giver's GUID from the incoming packet and initiates the process of displaying
    available quests to the player. The method ensures proper validation of the quest
    giver's state and prepares the necessary data structures for subsequent quest-related
    operations such as quest acceptance, completion, or progression. This is a core
    part of the World of Warcraft questing system implementation within TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic Quest Greeting Interaction
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestgiverHelloOpcode(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestGiverHello&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate that the quest giver is valid\n    if (!packet.QuestGiverGUID)\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Process the quest greeting\n    Player* player =\
      \ GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n\n    // Retrieve quest information\
      \ from database\n    // Display available quests to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core networking system and must be thread-safe
    as it's called from the network thread. It relies on proper packet validation
    before proceeding with quest processing. The method assumes that the client has
    already validated the interaction context.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly; it should only be invoked through the
    packet handling system. Improper handling of the QuestGiverGUID can lead to invalid
    quest data being displayed or errors in quest progression.
