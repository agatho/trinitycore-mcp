  method: GetRating
  signature: uint32 ArenaTeam::GetRating() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current rating of the arena team.
  description: The GetRating method retrieves the numerical rating value that represents
    the overall strength or skill level of the arena team. This rating is used in
    World of Warcraft's arena system to determine matchmaking, rewards, and team rankings.
    The returned value typically reflects the average rating of all members in the
    team, though exact calculation may depend on internal implementation details.
    This method is commonly used for displaying team strength, sorting teams, or determining
    eligibility for certain arena brackets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the arena team's current rating. Higher values
    indicate stronger teams. The specific range and meaning of this value depends
    on the game's rating system implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);

      uint32 rating = team->GetRating();

      TC_LOG_INFO("arena", "Team rating: %u", rating);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparison with Other Teams
    code: "ArenaTeam* myTeam = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nArenaTeam*\
      \ otherTeam = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(67890);\n\nif (myTeam && otherTeam)\
      \ {\n    uint32 myRating = myTeam->GetRating();\n    uint32 otherRating = otherTeam->GetRating();\n\
      \    \n    if (myRating > otherRating) {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"arena\", \"\
      Our team is stronger!\");\n    } else if (myRating < otherRating) {\n      \
      \  TC_LOG_INFO(\"arena\", \"Their team is stronger.\");\n    } else {\n    \
      \    TC_LOG_INFO(\"arena\", \"Teams are equally matched.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a cached value and may not reflect real-time changes
    immediately. The rating calculation might include factors such as recent match
    performance, team composition, and historical data. For high-frequency access,
    consider caching the result locally to avoid repeated calls.
