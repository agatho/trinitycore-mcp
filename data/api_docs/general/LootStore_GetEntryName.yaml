documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the loot entry associated with this LootStore instance
  description: The GetEntryName method retrieves the human-readable name string that
    identifies a specific loot entry within the LootStore. This name typically corresponds
    to the identifier used in database tables or configuration files to reference
    a particular set of loot rules. The returned pointer points to an internal static
    string buffer, so callers should not attempt to modify or free the memory. This
    method is commonly used in debugging and logging contexts to provide meaningful
    identifiers for loot systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const char* pointer to the null-terminated name string of the loot entry.
    The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the LootStore instance
    and should not be freed by the caller.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Logging
    code: "LootStore* store = sLootMgr->GetLootStore(12345);\nif (store)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Processing loot entry: %s\", store->GetEntryName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a pointer to an internal static buffer, which means concurrent
    calls may overwrite the returned string. For thread-safe usage, callers should
    copy the returned string immediately if they need to retain it beyond the current
    scope.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned pointer as it points to
    internal memory managed by the LootStore instance. Using the returned pointer
    after the LootStore has been destroyed results in undefined behavior.
