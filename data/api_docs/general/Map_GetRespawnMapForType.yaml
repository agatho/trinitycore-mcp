  method: GetRespawnMapForType
  signature: const int * Map::GetRespawnMapForType(SpawnObjectType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant integer array mapping spawn object types to their respawn
    times.
  description: The GetRespawnMapForType method retrieves a const int pointer that
    represents a lookup table or map of spawn object types to their respective respawn
    times in milliseconds. This is used internally by the TrinityCore server to determine
    how long it takes for different types of game objects (such as creatures, gameobjects,
    etc.) to respawn after being destroyed or despawned. The returned array is indexed
    by SpawnObjectType enum values and contains corresponding respawn delays. It's
    important to note that this method does not return a copy of the data but rather
    a direct reference to internal storage, so modifications should not be made to
    the returned pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int pointer to an array where indices correspond to SpawnObjectType
    enum values and the values represent respawn times in milliseconds. Returns nullptr
    if no valid mapping exists for the given type or if the map is uninitialized.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Respawn Time for a Creature
    code: "const int* respawnMap = map->GetRespawnMapForType(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE);\n\
      if (respawnMap != nullptr) {\n    int respawnTime = respawnMap[CREATURE_TYPE_NORMAL];\n\
      \    // Use respawnTime in logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating Through All Spawn Types
    code: "const int* respawnMap = map->GetRespawnMapForType(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT);\n\
      if (respawnMap != nullptr) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SPAWN_TYPES; ++i)\
      \ {\n        if (respawnMap[i] > 0) {\n            // Process respawn time for\
      \ type i\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal server data structures and should only be used
    during appropriate game state transitions or when the map is fully initialized.
    The returned pointer must not be freed or modified by the caller as it points
    to static internal memory. Performance-wise, this is a fast O(1) lookup operation.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned array as it points to internal
    server data. Accessing invalid indices beyond the defined spawn type range may
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the map object is valid and initialized
    before calling this method.
