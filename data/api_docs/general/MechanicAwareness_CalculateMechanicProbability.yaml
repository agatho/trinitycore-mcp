  signature: float MechanicAwareness::CalculateMechanicProbability(Unit * target,
    MechanicType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the probability that a target unit will be affected by a specific
    mechanic type.
  description: The CalculateMechanicProbability method determines the likelihood that
    a given target unit will be impacted by a specified mechanic type, such as stun,
    root, or silence. This calculation takes into account various factors including
    the target's resistance to the mechanic, any applicable buffs or debuffs, and
    the caster's ability to apply the mechanic. The method is typically used in AI
    decision-making processes to evaluate the effectiveness of different abilities
    or spells against a specific target. It returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where
    0.0 indicates no chance of the mechanic taking effect, and 1.0 indicates certainty.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for mechanic susceptibility.
      Must not be null.
  - name: type
    description: The MechanicType enum value representing the specific mechanic (e.g.,
      STUN, ROOT, SILENCE) whose probability is being calculated.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the probability that the
    target will be affected by the specified mechanic. A return value of 0.0 means
    no chance, while 1.0 means certain effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check stun probability
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nfloat stunChance = mechanicAwareness->CalculateMechanicProbability(target,\
      \ MECHANIC_STUN);\nif (stunChance > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Proceed with stun ability\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using probability to decide spell selection
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nfloat silenceChance = mechanicAwareness->CalculateMechanicProbability(target,\
      \ MECHANIC_SILENCE);\nif (silenceChance > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Cast silence spell\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_SILENCE);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Choose alternative ability\n\
      \    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_DISARM);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may consider target's resistance stats, current buffs/debuffs,
    and caster's spell power or skill level. The implementation likely involves complex
    calculations based on game mechanics and balance parameters. It should be called
    with valid Unit pointers to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method; passing
    a null pointer may lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The returned probability
    value should not be directly used for decision-making without considering other
    factors such as mana cost or cooldowns.
