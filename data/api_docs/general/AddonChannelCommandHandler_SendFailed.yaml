documentation:
  brief: Sends a failure message to the player's addon channel.
  description: The SendFailed method is used within the AddonChannelCommandHandler
    class to notify the player's addon channel that a command has failed. This method
    is typically invoked when an addon command cannot be executed due to invalid parameters,
    insufficient permissions, or other runtime errors. It ensures that the addon receives
    feedback about the command execution status and allows for proper error handling
    within the addon framework. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations, making it a simple notification mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Addon Command Handler
    code: "void MyAddonCommandHandler::HandleMyCommand()\n{\n    if (!HasRequiredPermissions())\n\
      \    {\n        SendFailed(); // Notify addon of failed permission check\n \
      \       return;\n    }\n    // Process command...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the addon communication system in TrinityCore and
    should only be called within the context of an addon command handler. It relies
    on the player's connection to the addon channel being properly established.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of a valid addon command
    handling context, as it may result in undefined behavior or failed communication
    with the addon.
