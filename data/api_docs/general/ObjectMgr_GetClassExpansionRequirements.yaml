documentation:
  brief: Returns the expansion requirements for class definitions in the game.
  description: The GetClassExpansionRequirements method retrieves the expansion level
    required to access or use specific class definitions within the TrinityCore database.
    This value typically corresponds to the minimum expansion version (such as Vanilla,
    The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King) that a player's character class must
    be compatible with. It is used during character creation and class validation
    processes to ensure that players can only select classes appropriate for their
    selected expansion. The returned reference points to an internal static value
    representing the current expansion requirement for all classes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer value indicating the minimum required
    expansion level (e.g., 0 for Classic, 1 for TBC, 2 for WotLK). This value determines
    which class definitions are available based on the game's expansion support.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Class Expansion Requirement
    code: "int expansion = sObjectMgr->GetClassExpansionRequirements();\nif (expansion\
      \ >= 1)\n{\n    // Allow access to TBC classes\n    // ... logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to an internal static variable,
    so modifications to the returned value will not affect the actual expansion requirement.
    The value is initialized at startup from database configuration settings and should
    remain unchanged during runtime.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference as it points to a shared static value.
    Changes made to this value may cause inconsistent behavior across different parts
    of the server logic that rely on class expansion requirements.
