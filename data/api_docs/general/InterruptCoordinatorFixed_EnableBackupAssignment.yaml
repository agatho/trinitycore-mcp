  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: EnableBackupAssignment
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::EnableBackupAssignment(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables backup assignment functionality within the interrupt
    coordinator.
  description: The EnableBackupAssignment method controls whether backup assignment
    is active in the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class. This functionality likely manages
    fallback behavior when primary interrupt handling fails or is unavailable. The
    method takes a boolean parameter to determine the state of this feature. When
    enabled, backup assignments may be triggered under specific conditions such as
    resource unavailability or failure of primary interrupt handlers. This mechanism
    ensures robustness in interrupt processing by providing alternative paths for
    handling interruptions.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether backup assignment functionality
      should be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Backup Assignment
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.EnableBackupAssignment(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Backup Assignment
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.EnableBackupAssignment(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal state management of the interrupt coordinator
    and may have implications for performance under high interrupt load. The exact
    behavior of backup assignment is dependent on implementation details of the InterruptCoordinatorFixed
    class.
