  class: ObjectGridEvacuator
  method: Visit
  signature: void ObjectGridEvacuator::Visit(GameObjectMapType & m)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and evacuates all game objects within a specified grid map type.
  description: The Visit method of the ObjectGridEvacuator class iterates through
    all game objects stored in the provided GameObjectMapType container and performs
    evacuation operations on them. This typically involves removing or clearing references
    to objects that are no longer needed within a specific grid area, such as when
    a grid is being unloaded or cleaned up. The method serves as part of TrinityCore's
    object management system, ensuring proper cleanup and memory handling during world
    state transitions or grid unloading events.
  parameters:
  - name: m
    description: Reference to a GameObjectMapType container holding game objects within
      a specific grid area. This parameter represents the collection of GameObjects
      that will be processed for evacuation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Evacuating Objects from a Grid Map
    code: 'ObjectGridEvacuator evacuator;

      GameObjectMapType gridObjects;

      // ... populate gridObjects with GameObjects ...

      evacuator.Visit(gridObjects);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core game loop or during
    grid unloading processes. It's important to note that this method modifies the
    state of objects within the provided map, potentially removing them from active
    gameplay. The implementation assumes thread safety for the GameObjectMapType container
    if used in a multi-threaded context.
