  class: CorpseReferenceGuard
  method: operator=
  signature: CorpseReferenceGuard & CorpseReferenceGuard::operator=(const CorpseReferenceGuard
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one CorpseReferenceGuard object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of a CorpseReferenceGuard
    object, transferring all internal state and references from the source object
    to the target object. This operation ensures that both objects maintain consistent
    references to the same corpse data while properly managing reference counting
    and memory allocation. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this
    method is crucial for managing corpse references during player death, resurrection,
    and related gameplay mechanics where multiple references to the same corpse entity
    must be maintained correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source CorpseReferenceGuard object whose contents will be copied
      to this object
  returns: A reference to the current CorpseReferenceGuard object, allowing for chained
    assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'CorpseReferenceGuard guard1;

      CorpseReferenceGuard guard2 = guard1; // Uses operator=

      // or

      CorpseReferenceGuard guard3;

      guard3 = guard1; // Uses operator='
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'CorpseReferenceGuard guard1, guard2, guard3;

      // ... initialize guards ...

      guard1 = guard2 = guard3; // Chained assignment using operator='
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely implements reference counting semantics to prevent memory
    leaks and ensure proper cleanup of corpse references. The implementation may involve
    atomic operations or mutex locking for thread safety in multi-threaded server
    environments.
  warnings: Improper use of assignment operators with reference-counted objects can
    lead to dangling references or memory corruption. Ensure that all references are
    properly managed when performing assignments.
