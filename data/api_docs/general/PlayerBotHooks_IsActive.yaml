documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player bot is currently active and operational within
    the game world.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a player bot instance is currently
    active and functioning within the TrinityCore environment. This method typically
    evaluates internal state flags or runtime conditions to verify that the bot has
    been properly initialized, is not in a suspended or terminated state, and can
    process commands or actions. It's commonly used by game systems, AI modules, or
    external scripts to ensure that interactions with the bot are valid before proceeding.
    The method does not require any parameters and returns a boolean value indicating
    the active status of the bot.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player bot is currently active and operational; otherwise,
    returns false if the bot is inactive, uninitialized, or in a terminated state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot status
    code: "if (playerBot->IsActive()) {\n    // Bot is active, proceed with bot-specific\
      \ logic\n    playerBot->UpdateAI();\n} else {\n    // Bot is not active, skip\
      \ AI updates\n    LogMessage(\"Player bot is inactive.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with a command handler
    code: "void HandleBotStatusCommand(Player* player) {\n    if (player->GetSession()->GetPlayerBot()\
      \ && player->GetSession()->GetPlayerBot()->IsActive()) {\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Bot is currently active.\");\n    } else {\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Bot is not active.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks on internal state flags rather
    than complex validation. It's recommended to cache the result of this call if
    it's used frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: "Do not assume that a bot remains active after calling IsActive() \u2014\
    \ its status can change at any time due to external events like disconnection,\
    \ shutdown, or state transitions. Always validate the bot's activity before performing\
    \ operations that might cause errors if the bot is inactive."
