  class: InterruptManager
  method: InterruptManager
  signature: void InterruptManager::InterruptManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the InterruptManager with a player reference for managing interruptible
    actions.
  description: The InterruptManager constructor initializes the manager with a specific
    Player object, setting up internal state to track and handle interruptible game
    actions such as spell casting or movement. This method prepares the manager to
    respond to interrupts triggered by player actions, environmental events, or other
    game mechanics that may cause ongoing actions to be canceled. The manager typically
    stores a reference to the bot player to determine when and how interrupts should
    be processed during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that this InterruptManager will manage.
      This represents the AI-controlled character whose actions may be interrupted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of InterruptManager
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr(playerBot);

      // The interrupt manager is now initialized with playerBot for handling interrupts.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any complex initialization logic; it simply
    stores the provided Player pointer. Developers should ensure that the Player object
    remains valid throughout the lifetime of the InterruptManager instance to avoid
    dangling pointer issues.
