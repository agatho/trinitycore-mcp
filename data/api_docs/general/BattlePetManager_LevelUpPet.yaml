  class: BattlePetManager
  method: LevelUpPet
  signature: bool BattlePetManager::LevelUpPet(int * player, uint32 speciesId)
documentation:
  brief: Levels up a battle pet for the specified player.
  description: The LevelUpPet method increases the level of a battle pet owned by
    the player. It takes a pointer to the player object and the species ID of the
    pet to be leveled up. The method checks if the pet exists and can be leveled up,
    then updates its level accordingly. This function is typically used in conjunction
    with battle pet mechanics within the World of Warcraft game environment, particularly
    when managing player collections of battle pets.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the battle
      pet.
  - name: speciesId
    description: The unique identifier for the species of the battle pet to be leveled
      up.
  returns: Returns true if the pet was successfully leveled up, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if the player does not own a pet with the specified species
    ID or if the pet has already reached its maximum level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LevelUpPet
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player object\nuint32 speciesId = 12345; //\
      \ Example species ID\nbool result = BattlePetManager::LevelUpPet(&player, speciesId);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Pet leveled up successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object is valid and properly initialized.
    It may involve database operations to persist the pet's new level. The implementation
    might also include checks for pet ownership, level limits, and other game rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method.
    Also, verify that the speciesId corresponds to a valid battle pet species in the
    game database. Calling this function without proper validation may lead to undefined
    behavior or database inconsistencies.
