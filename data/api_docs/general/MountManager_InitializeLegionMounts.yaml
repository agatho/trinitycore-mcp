documentation:
  brief: Initializes Legion-era mounts for the MountManager.
  description: The InitializeLegionMounts method sets up and registers all Legion
    expansion mounts within the MountManager system. This method is responsible for
    loading mount data specific to the Legion (7.0) expansion, including their display
    IDs, spell IDs, and unlock requirements. It ensures that players can access and
    use Legion mounts upon login or when the expansion content becomes available.
    The method typically runs during server startup or expansion activation and prepares
    internal data structures needed for mount handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager* mountMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetMountManager();

      mountMgr->InitializeLegionMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    the Legion expansion is enabled. It modifies internal mount databases and should
    not be invoked repeatedly. The method assumes that all necessary Legion mount
    data has been loaded into the database.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate mount entries
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that it's only called once during proper initialization
    phases to avoid data corruption.
