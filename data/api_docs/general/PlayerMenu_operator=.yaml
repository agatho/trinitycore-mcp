documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another PlayerMenu object to this PlayerMenu instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source PlayerMenu object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used in scenarios where a temporary or intermediate PlayerMenu object needs to
    be efficiently transferred to another without unnecessary copying. The method
    ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the move, and it returns a reference to the current object for chaining operations.
    In the context of TrinityCore's player menu system, this operator supports efficient
    resource management when handling UI menus or interaction interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current PlayerMenu object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'PlayerMenu menu1;

      PlayerMenu menu2 = std::move(menu1); // Uses move assignment

      // menu1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Operations
    code: 'PlayerMenu menu1, menu2, menu3;

      menu3 = std::move(menu2) = std::move(menu1); // Chained move assignments

      // menu1 and menu2 are left in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard. It's important
    to note that after a move operation, the source object should not be used unless
    explicitly reset or reassigned. The implementation typically involves transferring
    pointers, handles, or other resource identifiers rather than copying data.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure all references to the source object are invalidated or reinitialized
    before further use. Also, be cautious when using this in containers or collections
    where elements may be moved during reallocation.
