documentation:
  brief: Resets all cached object statistics to their default values
  description: The ResetStats method clears and reinitializes all statistical data
    stored within the ObjectCache instance. This operation typically occurs when cache
    state needs to be refreshed or reset, such as during server maintenance, map transitions,
    or when clearing outdated performance metrics. The method ensures that all cached
    object statistics are returned to their initial state without retaining any previous
    values.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectCache* cache = ObjectCache::GetGlobalCache();

      cache->ResetStats();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will invalidate all cached statistics
    and may impact performance monitoring or debugging tools that rely on historical
    data. It's typically used during server shutdown procedures or when cache consistency
    is required.
  warnings: Calling ResetStats while other threads are actively using the cache may
    lead to inconsistent state or race conditions. Ensure thread safety when invoking
    this method in multi-threaded environments.
