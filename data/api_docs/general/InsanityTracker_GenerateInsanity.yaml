  class: InsanityTracker
  method: GenerateInsanity
  signature: void InsanityTracker::GenerateInsanity(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates insanity amount for the tracked player or unit.
  description: The GenerateInsanity method is responsible for increasing the insanity
    value of a tracked entity within the InsanityTracker system. This method typically
    represents a game mechanic where certain actions or events cause an increase in
    insanity, which may affect gameplay behavior such as spell casting, damage output,
    or status effects. The method accepts a uint32 parameter that defines how much
    insanity to generate, allowing for flexible adjustments based on different game
    events or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of insanity to generate. This value is added to the current
      insanity level of the tracked entity. Valid values are positive integers representing
      the magnitude of insanity increase.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Insanity Generation
    code: 'InsanityTracker tracker;

      tracker.GenerateInsanity(50);

      // Increases the tracked entity''s insanity by 50 points.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Insanity Based on Spell Effect
    code: "void OnSpellCast(Player* player, uint32 spellId) {\n    if (spellId ==\
      \ 12345) // Example insanity-generating spell\n        player->GetInsanityTracker()->GenerateInsanity(25);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables within the InsanityTracker
    class. It may trigger events or callbacks when insanity thresholds are crossed,
    though those details are not specified in the method signature alone.
  warnings: Ensure that the InsanityTracker instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about large
    values passed to amount as they could potentially overflow or cause unexpected
    gameplay effects.
