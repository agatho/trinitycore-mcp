  class: ThreatIntegrationExample
  method: ConfigureForMythicPlus
  signature: void ThreatIntegrationExample::ConfigureForMythicPlus(ThreatCoordinator
    * coordinator, uint32 mythicLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Configures threat integration settings for Mythic+ dungeon encounters.
  description: The ConfigureForMythicPlus method initializes and sets up the threat
    coordination system specifically tailored for Mythic+ dungeon content. This method
    adjusts internal threat behaviors, scaling factors, and encounter-specific parameters
    to ensure proper mob aggro mechanics during high-level dungeon runs. It modifies
    how the ThreatCoordinator handles threat generation, management, and distribution
    among players in a Mythic+ environment. The method requires a valid ThreatCoordinator
    instance and a valid mythic level (1-20) to properly configure the system.
  parameters:
  - name: coordinator
    description: Pointer to the ThreatCoordinator instance that will be configured
      for Mythic+ content. Must not be null.
  - name: mythicLevel
    description: The difficulty level of the Mythic+ dungeon (1-20). Determines scaling
      factors and threat behaviors applied to the coordinator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration for Mythic+
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coord = new ThreatCoordinator();

      example->ConfigureForMythicPlus(coord, 10);

      // Configures the threat system for a +10 Mythic+ dungeon'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Configuration Based on Player Progress
    code: 'uint32 level = player->GetMythicPlusLevel();

      ThreatCoordinator* coord = sThreatMgr->GetThreatCoordinator();

      example->ConfigureForMythicPlus(coord, level);

      // Dynamically configures threat system based on current player''s Mythic+ level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during dungeon initialization or when entering
    a new Mythic+ encounter. The ThreatCoordinator must be properly initialized before
    calling this method. Performance impact is minimal as it only modifies internal
    configuration parameters.
  warnings: Do not call this method with mythicLevel values outside the valid range
    (1-20). Passing null coordinator pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure
    that the ThreatCoordinator is not actively managing threats when this method is
    invoked.
