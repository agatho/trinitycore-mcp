  method: OnCombatStartSpecific
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat-specific behavior for an Arms Warrior when entering combat
    with a target
  description: The OnCombatStartSpecific method is invoked when an Arms Warrior enters
    combat mode, typically triggered by engaging a hostile unit. This method handles
    the initialization of warrior-specific combat behaviors, including setting up
    proper stance, preparing weapon skills, and configuring AI decision-making logic
    tailored for arms warrior gameplay. The method is part of the TrinityCore AI framework
    and is designed to be overridden in custom AI implementations. It ensures that
    the warrior's combat state is properly initialized before any combat actions are
    executed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the combat target. This parameter
      specifies which entity the warrior is engaging in combat. The target must be
      a valid Unit instance, typically an enemy creature or player character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void ArmsWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStartSpecific(Unit* target)\n{\n  \
      \  // Initialize warrior stance\n    if (me->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_UNIT)\n \
      \   {\n        me->SetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      \        // Set up weapon skills and combat abilities\n        me->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BATTLE_SHOUT, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system when a unit enters
    combat state. Developers should ensure that any custom implementation properly
    handles null target pointers and validates the target's type before proceeding
    with combat initialization logic.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the target pointer is valid before using it in spell
    casts or other combat actions.
