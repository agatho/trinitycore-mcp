  class: AuctionBotAgent
  method: Update
  signature: bool AuctionBotAgent::Update(AuctionHouseType houseType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction bot agent's state and processes auction house activities
    for the specified auction house type.
  description: The Update method is responsible for executing the core logic of the
    AuctionBotAgent, handling tasks such as scanning the auction house for items,
    managing bids, and updating the bot's internal state. It performs periodic checks
    on the specified auction house type (e.g., Alliance, Horde, or Neutral) to ensure
    the bot remains active and responsive. The method typically runs in a loop or
    is invoked by the game's update system at regular intervals. This function may
    also handle cleanup operations, logging, and synchronization with the auction
    house database.
  parameters:
  - name: houseType
    description: Specifies the type of auction house to update. Valid values are typically
      AuctionHouseType::AH_TYPE_ALLIANCE, AuctionHouseType::AH_TYPE_HORDE, or AuctionHouseType::AH_TYPE_NEUTRAL
      depending on the game's implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the update process completed successfully and no critical
    errors occurred; otherwise returns false to indicate failure or cancellation of
    the update operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Usage
    code: "AuctionBotAgent bot;\nbool success = bot.Update(AuctionHouseType::AH_TYPE_ALLIANCE);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot updated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Error Handling
    code: "AuctionBotAgent* agent = GetAuctionBotAgent();\nif (agent != nullptr) {\n\
      \    bool result = agent->Update(AuctionHouseType::AH_TYPE_NEUTRAL);\n    if\
      \ (!result) {\n        // Log error or retry logic\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to update auction bot for neutral auction house.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the game's main update loop, and its
    performance can impact overall server responsiveness. It may block or perform
    I/O operations when interacting with the auction house system.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method's return value could lead to inconsistent
    bot behavior or missed auction opportunities. Ensure that the AuctionHouseType
    parameter is valid before calling this function.
