  class: PathfindingManager
  method: PathfindingManager
  signature: void PathfindingManager::PathfindingManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new pathfinding manager instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The PathfindingManager constructor initializes a new pathfinding manager
    object for a given player bot. This method sets up internal data structures and
    configurations required for pathfinding operations within the TrinityCore framework.
    The manager is responsible for calculating movement paths, handling navigation
    through terrain, and managing AI-driven movement behaviors for NPC bots. It typically
    gets called during bot initialization or when a new bot instance is created in
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this pathfinding
      manager will control. Must not be null and must represent a valid player instance
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pathfinding Manager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      PathfindingManager* pathfinder = new PathfindingManager(myBot);

      // The pathfinder is now ready to perform pathfinding operations for myBot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal pathfinding caches, registers
    the bot with navigation systems, and prepares necessary data structures for efficient
    path calculations. It's important that the Player pointer passed in is valid and
    represents an active bot instance.
