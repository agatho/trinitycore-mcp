  signature: void CharacterCache::DeleteCharacterCacheEntry(const int & guid, const
    std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a character entry from the cache using its GUID and name.
  description: The DeleteCharacterCacheEntry method removes a cached character entry
    from the CharacterCache system. This function is typically used when a character
    is deleted or modified in such a way that the cached data becomes invalid. The
    method takes both the unique identifier (GUID) and the character's name as parameters
    to ensure accurate identification and removal of the specific cache entry. It
    is part of TrinityCore's internal caching mechanism designed to improve performance
    by avoiding repeated database lookups for frequently accessed character data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to be removed from
      the cache. This value must correspond to a valid character GUID in the database.
  - name: name
    description: The name of the character to be removed from the cache. This string
      should match exactly with the character's name stored in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: CharacterCache::DeleteCharacterCacheEntry(12345, "JohnDoe");
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'uint32 characterGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string characterName = player->GetName();

      CharacterCache::DeleteCharacterCacheEntry(characterGuid, characterName);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on an in-memory cache and does not directly interact
    with the database. It is important to call this function whenever a character's
    data changes in a way that would invalidate the cached information. The implementation
    likely uses a hash map or similar data structure for fast lookup and removal.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect GUID or name values may result in cache
    entries not being removed, potentially leading to stale data being served from
    cache. Ensure that both parameters are validated before calling this function.
