  signature: bool CriteriaHandler::IsCompletedCriteria(const Criteria * criteria,
    uint64 requiredAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a criteria has been completed based on the required amount.
  description: The IsCompletedCriteria method determines whether a specific criteria
    object has been fulfilled according to the required amount. This method is typically
    used in achievement and quest systems within TrinityCore to evaluate if player
    progress meets the conditions necessary for criteria completion. The method likely
    interacts with internal tracking mechanisms that monitor player activities and
    compare them against the criteria requirements. It serves as a core component
    in the evaluation of criteria-based rewards and achievements.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: Pointer to the Criteria object that defines the conditions to be
      checked for completion. This parameter must not be null and should reference
      a valid criteria definition from the game's database.
  - name: requiredAmount
    description: The amount of progress required to consider the criteria as completed.
      This value typically represents the target count or threshold that must be reached
      for the criteria to be marked as fulfilled.
  returns: Returns true if the criteria has been completed based on the required amount,
    false otherwise. The method evaluates whether the current progress meets or exceeds
    the specified requiredAmount for the given criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Criteria* myCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\nif (myHandler.IsCompletedCriteria(myCriteria,\
      \ 10)) {\n    // Criteria is completed with at least 10 progress\n    printf(\"\
      Criteria completed!\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Achievement Progress Check
    code: "uint64 playerProgress = player->GetAchievementMgr()->GetCriteriaProgress(criteriaId);\n\
      Criteria* criteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(criteriaId);\nif (criteria && myHandler.IsCompletedCriteria(criteria,\
      \ playerProgress)) {\n    // Award achievement or reward\n    player->CompleteAchievement(achievementId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking systems that maintain progress
    counters for each criteria. It may involve database lookups or cached values depending
    on the implementation. The method should be called with valid criteria pointers
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the criteria parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The requiredAmount
    parameter should represent realistic progress values that align with the criteria
    definition.
