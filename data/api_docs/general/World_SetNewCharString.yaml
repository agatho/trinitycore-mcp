  method: SetNewCharString
  signature: void World::SetNewCharString(const std::string & str)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the new character string for the world, typically used during server
    initialization or configuration updates.
  description: The SetNewCharString method assigns a new character string to the World
    object, which is commonly utilized during server startup or configuration changes.
    This method likely updates internal state variables that control how new characters
    are handled within the game world. The implementation may involve validating the
    input string and ensuring it meets specific criteria for character naming or identification
    purposes. This method does not return any value and operates directly on the instance's
    internal data members.
  parameters:
  - name: str
    description: The new character string to be assigned to the world. This should
      be a valid UTF-8 encoded string representing the desired character identifier
      or name.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a New Character String
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      world->SetNewCharString("NewCharacterName");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during server initialization or when processing
    configuration changes. It's important to ensure that the input string does not
    contain invalid characters or exceed maximum length limits as defined by the game's
    character naming rules.
  warnings: No explicit warnings are known for this method, but improper use of the
    input string could potentially lead to issues with character creation or validation
    in the game world. Ensure proper string sanitization before calling this method.
