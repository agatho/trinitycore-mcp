  method: IsInCheckCastHook
  signature: bool SpellScript::IsInCheckCastHook() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current spell script execution is within a check cast
    hook context.
  description: The IsInCheckCastHook method checks if the current execution context
    of a SpellScript is inside a 'check cast' hook. This is typically used in spell
    scripts to determine if validation or pre-cast checks are being performed. The
    method returns true when the script is executing within a check cast phase, such
    as during spell targeting or validation, and false otherwise. This allows developers
    to conditionally execute logic based on whether the spell is currently being validated
    rather than executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current spell script execution is within a check cast
    hook context; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell script
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleDummyEffect()\n\
      \    {\n        if (IsInCheckCastHook())\n        {\n            // This code\
      \ runs during spell validation\n            // e.g., check if target is valid\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // This code runs during actual\
      \ spell execution\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in custom spell scripts to differentiate between
    validation and execution phases. It's particularly useful for implementing conditional
    logic that should only run during spell targeting or validation, such as custom
    target checks or pre-cast validations.
