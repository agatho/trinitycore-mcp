  class: Battlefield
  method: SpawnGameObject
  signature: GameObject * Battlefield::SpawnGameObject(int entry, const Position &
    pos, const QuaternionData & rot)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a game object with the specified entry ID at the given position and
    rotation within the battlefield.
  description: The SpawnGameObject method creates and places a new GameObject instance
    into the battlefield world. It takes an entry identifier, position coordinates,
    and rotational data to determine where and how the object is instantiated. This
    method is typically used during battlefield initialization or dynamic event handling
    to add interactive elements like doors, traps, or decorative objects. The spawned
    GameObject becomes part of the battlefield's active object list and will be managed
    by the game world system until explicitly removed. The method returns a pointer
    to the newly created GameObject instance which can be used for further manipulation
    or reference.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the GameObject template to spawn.
      This corresponds to entries defined in the game's database tables such as gameobject_template.
  - name: pos
    description: The Position structure containing the x, y, z coordinates where the
      GameObject should be spawned in the world.
  - name: rot
    description: The QuaternionData structure defining the orientation of the spawned
      GameObject using quaternion rotation values (x, y, z, w).
  returns: A pointer to the newly created GameObject instance if successful, or nullptr
    if the spawn operation failed due to invalid parameters or resource limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObject Spawn
    code: "GameObject* go = battlefield->SpawnGameObject(176582, Position(100.0f,\
      \ 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f), QuaternionData(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));\nif (go)\n\
      {\n    // Successfully spawned game object\n    go->SetRespawnTime(300); //\
      \ Set respawn time to 5 minutes\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spawn with Custom Rotation
    code: "Position spawnPos(500.0f, 600.0f, 700.0f);\nQuaternionData rotation;\n\
      rotation.x = 0.0f;\nrotation.y = 0.0f;\nrotation.z = 0.707f;\nrotation.w = 0.707f;\
      \ // 90 degree rotation around Z-axis\nGameObject* door = battlefield->SpawnGameObject(181562,\
      \ spawnPos, rotation);\nif (door)\n{\n    door->SetUInt32Value(GAMEOBJECT_FLAGS,\
      \ GO_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method integrates with TrinityCore's GameObject system and relies on
    proper database entries for the specified 'entry' parameter. The returned GameObject
    pointer should be stored carefully as it may become invalid if the object is destroyed
    or removed from the battlefield. Consider using smart pointers or reference counting
    mechanisms when storing references to spawned objects.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a game loop without proper synchronization,
    as it may cause race conditions with the world update system. Ensure that all
    parameters are valid before calling - especially the entry ID which must exist
    in the database or the function will return nullptr. Be cautious about spawning
    too many objects simultaneously as it can impact performance.
