  class: StormkeeperTracker
  method: HasStack
  signature: bool StormkeeperTracker::HasStack() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the StormkeeperTracker has an active stack.
  description: The HasStack method determines whether the StormkeeperTracker currently
    holds a valid stack. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    to manage abilities or effects that are applied through stacking mechanics, such
    as certain buffs or debuffs. The method returns true if there is at least one
    stack present, and false otherwise. It does not modify any internal state and
    is generally used for conditional logic within game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the StormkeeperTracker has an active
    stack. Returns true if stacks are present; false if no stacks exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Condition
    code: "if (tracker.HasStack()) {\n    // Apply effect or increment counter\n \
      \   tracker.IncrementStack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Stack Status Before Removal
    code: "if (tracker.HasStack()) {\n    tracker.RemoveStack();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle case when no stacks remain\n    SendNotification(\"No stacks remaining\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other stack-related methods
    like AddStack(), RemoveStack(), and GetStackCount(). It's important to note that
    the behavior may vary depending on how the StormkeeperTracker is implemented within
    specific game mechanics or spells.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in performance-critical sections
    without considering potential overhead. Also, be cautious when relying on stack
    status for complex logic, as improper handling might lead to inconsistent gameplay
    states.
