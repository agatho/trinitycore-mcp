documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuestPOIBlobData object with specified quest objective and
    UI map properties.
  description: The QuestPOIBlobData constructor initializes a data structure used
    by the World of Warcraft TrinityCore server to manage quest point-of-interest
    (POI) blob information. This structure holds metadata about quest objectives,
    including their visual representation on the minimap and world map, associated
    UI elements, and mapping details. The constructor sets up internal fields that
    define how quest POIs are displayed to players based on various conditions such
    as player progress, map context, and visual priority. This initialization is typically
    performed when building or updating quest POI data for client synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: blobIndex
    description: The index identifier for this POI blob within the quest's overall
      POI structure. Used to distinguish between multiple POIs associated with a single
      quest.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific quest objective this blob represents. Helps
      map POI data to individual objectives within a quest.
  - name: questObjectiveID
    description: Unique identifier for the quest objective that this POI blob corresponds
      to. Links the visual data to a specific quest objective in the database.
  - name: questObjectID
    description: Identifier for the quest object associated with this POI, used to
      track quest-related entities like NPCs or items.
  - name: mapID
    description: The map identifier where this quest POI is located. Determines which
      map the POI should appear on in the client.
  - name: uiMapID
    description: UI map identifier used for rendering the POI in the user interface,
      potentially different from the actual game map ID.
  - name: priority
    description: Visual priority level of this POI blob. Higher values are rendered
      with higher visual precedence on the map.
  - name: flags
    description: Bitfield flags that define various behaviors and properties for this
      POI blob, such as visibility conditions or interaction types.
  - name: worldEffectID
    description: Identifier for a world effect associated with this quest POI, used
      to trigger special visual effects when the player interacts with or approaches
      the POI.
  - name: playerConditionID
    description: Player condition identifier that determines whether this POI should
      be visible to the player based on their current state or progress.
  - name: navigationPlayerConditionID
    description: Player condition used for navigation-related logic, such as determining
      if a path should be shown from the player's location to this POI.
  - name: spawnTrackingID
    description: Identifier used to track the spawn state of quest-related objects
      or NPCs associated with this POI blob.
  - name: points
    description: Array of coordinate points that define the shape or path of the POI
      blob on the map, typically used for polygonal representations.
  - name: alwaysAllowMergingBlobs
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this POI blob should always be merged
      with other nearby blobs, regardless of proximity or type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a basic quest POI blob
    code: QuestPOIBlobData blob(0, 1, 12345, 67890, 123, 456, 100, 0, -1, 1001, 1002,
      1003, pointsArray, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Create a high-priority quest POI blob with special effects
    code: QuestPOIBlobData blob(1, 0, 54321, 98765, 789, 321, 500, 1, 200, 2001, 2002,
      2003, pointsArray, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the core quest system
    when building POI data structures. The 'points' parameter should be a valid array
    of coordinate pairs that define the blob's shape on the map. The 'alwaysAllowMergingBlobs'
    flag affects how POIs are rendered in close proximity to each other, potentially
    reducing visual clutter.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the 'points' array can cause rendering issues or client-side
    crashes. The 'playerConditionID' and related condition IDs must reference valid
    entries in the player condition database table, otherwise the POI may not display
    correctly. Using invalid map IDs or UI map IDs can result in POIs appearing in
    wrong locations or not appearing at all.
