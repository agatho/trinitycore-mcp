  class: PathfindingManager
  method: FindPathAsync
  signature: void PathfindingManager::FindPathAsync(const PathRequest & request)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates an asynchronous pathfinding request for a given navigation mesh
    and start/end points.
  description: The FindPathAsync method is used to asynchronously compute a path between
    two points within the game world using the TrinityCore pathfinding system. This
    method does not block execution while computing the path, instead queuing the
    request for background processing. The result of the pathfinding operation will
    be delivered through a callback mechanism or by polling for completion. It is
    typically invoked when AI units or players need to navigate complex environments
    such as cities, dungeons, or outdoor terrains where direct movement is not possible
    due to obstacles or terrain features.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: A PathRequest object containing the necessary parameters for pathfinding
      including start and end positions, navigation mesh identifier, and optional
      constraints like maximum path length or node types to avoid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindPathAsync
    code: 'PathRequest request;

      request.start = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      request.end = {400.0f, 500.0f, 600.0f};

      request.navMeshId = 1;

      pathfindingManager->FindPathAsync(request);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should be used in performance-critical
    code paths where synchronous pathfinding would cause frame drops or lag. The actual
    path computation happens on a separate thread, so results must be handled asynchronously.
  warnings: Ensure that the PathRequest object passed to this function remains valid
    until the asynchronous operation completes, as references may be accessed after
    the method returns. Also, avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops
    without proper rate limiting or batching strategies.
