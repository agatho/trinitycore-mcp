  method: UpdateKitingState
  signature: void KitingManager::UpdateKitingState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the kiting state of a player based on current movement and target
    conditions.
  description: The UpdateKitingState method manages the kiting behavior for a player
    character within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the player's current
    movement state, target position, and combat conditions to determine whether kiting
    (maintaining distance while attacking) should be enabled or disabled. This method
    is typically called during the AI update cycle and affects how the player's movement
    and attack patterns are handled in combat scenarios. The method considers factors
    such as player speed, target distance, and threat levels to make intelligent decisions
    about when to engage or disengage from kiting behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    _kitingManager->UpdateKitingState();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core kiting system and should be called regularly
    during AI updates. The implementation may vary based on the specific creature
    or player type being managed. Performance is generally low as it only performs
    simple distance and state calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in contexts where it might interfere
    with other movement systems. Avoid calling it during critical path operations
    that require immediate response times.
