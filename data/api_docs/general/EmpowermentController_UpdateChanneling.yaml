  brief: Updates the channeling state of an empowerment effect
  description: The UpdateChanneling method is responsible for managing the ongoing
    state of a channeling empowerment effect within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method typically handles the logic for maintaining, updating, or terminating channeling
    effects that are applied to players or creatures. It may process tick-based updates,
    check for interruption conditions, and manage the visual or auditory feedback
    associated with the channeling state. The method is commonly invoked during game
    loop iterations or in response to specific events that affect channeling mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all active empowerment effects\n\
      \    for (auto& controller : m_empowermentControllers)\n    {\n        controller->UpdateChanneling();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Channeling Effect Update with Interruption Check
    code: "void EmpowermentController::UpdateChanneling()\n{\n    if (!m_isChanneling)\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Process channeling tick\n    m_channelTime += GetFrameTime();\n\
      \    \n    if (m_channelTime >= m_maxChannelTime)\n    {\n        FinishChanneling();\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n\n    // Check for interruption conditions\n    if\
      \ (HasInterrupted())\n    {\n        InterruptChanneling();\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n\n    // Update visual effects or apply periodic damage\n    UpdateVisualEffects();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or through event-driven
    systems. It's important to ensure that channeling effects are properly cleaned
    up when interrupted or completed to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior.
    The method may be invoked multiple times per frame depending on the implementation
    and game tick rate.
  warnings: Improper handling of channeling state can lead to visual artifacts, incorrect
    gameplay mechanics, or even crashes if the effect is not properly terminated.
    Always validate that the channeling state is valid before performing updates to
    prevent accessing invalid memory or objects.
