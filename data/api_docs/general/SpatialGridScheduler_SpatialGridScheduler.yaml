documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpatialGridScheduler instance as a copy of an existing
    scheduler.
  description: The SpatialGridScheduler constructor creates a new scheduler object
    by copying the state and configuration from an existing SpatialGridScheduler instance.
    This copy constructor ensures that all internal grid data structures, scheduling
    information, and spatial indexing parameters are duplicated to maintain consistent
    behavior across multiple scheduler instances. The method is typically used when
    creating new scheduler objects that should mirror the configuration of an existing
    one, such as when spawning new grid schedulers for different regions or zones
    in a world environment.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing SpatialGridScheduler instance to copy from. This parameter
      must be a valid, initialized scheduler object whose state will be replicated
      in the newly created instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an Existing Scheduler
    code: 'SpatialGridScheduler originalScheduler;

      // ... configure originalScheduler ...

      SpatialGridScheduler newScheduler(originalScheduler); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the scheduler's internal state.
    Developers should be aware that any modifications to shared resources or references
    within the copied scheduler may affect both instances if not handled carefully.
    The implementation assumes that the source scheduler is in a valid, consistent
    state.
  warnings: Using this constructor with an uninitialized or corrupted source scheduler
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that param0 represents a properly constructed
    SpatialGridScheduler object before calling this constructor.
