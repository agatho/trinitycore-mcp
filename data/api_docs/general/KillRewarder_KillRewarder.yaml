documentation:
  brief: Processes reward distribution for a kill based on killer count and victim
    information
  description: The KillRewarder::KillRewarder method handles the logic for distributing
    rewards when a unit is killed. It takes into account the number of killers involved
    in the kill, the victim unit, and whether the kill occurred during a battleground.
    This method is responsible for triggering appropriate reward mechanisms such as
    experience points, honor, and loot distribution based on the game context and
    player involvement.
  parameters:
  - name: killers
    description: The number of players or units that contributed to killing the victim.
      Used to determine reward distribution scaling and honor allocation.
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the creature or player that
      was killed. This parameter is used to determine what rewards should be given
      based on the victim's type and level.
  - name: isBattleGround
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the kill occurred in a battleground
      environment. When true, special battleground reward rules are applied such as
      honor points and battleground-specific loot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Kill Reward Distribution
    code: 'KillRewarder rewarder;

      Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      rewarder.KillRewarder(1, target, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Battleground Kill with Multiple Killers
    code: 'KillRewarder rewarder;

      Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      rewarder.KillRewarder(3, target, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a kill
    event occurs. Developers should ensure that the victim parameter is valid and
    not null before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The method may
    trigger multiple reward systems including experience gain, loot drops, and honor
    point distribution.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null victim pointer can lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation of inputs before invoking
    the method. Be cautious when using this in custom scripts as improper usage might
    disrupt game balance or reward mechanics.
