  class: CooldownManager
  method: CleanupExpiredCooldowns
  signature: void CooldownManager::CleanupExpiredCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all expired cooldown entries from the cooldown manager's internal
    tracking system.
  description: The CleanupExpiredCooldowns method iterates through all active cooldown
    entries stored within the CooldownManager and removes those that have exceeded
    their specified duration. This process ensures that the cooldown manager does
    not retain outdated cooldown data, which could otherwise lead to memory bloat
    or incorrect behavior in cooldown-related game mechanics. The method is typically
    invoked periodically by the game loop or upon specific events such as player logout
    or zone changes. It operates on the principle of maintaining an accurate and up-to-date
    list of active cooldowns for all applicable entities (such as players, creatures,
    or game objects).

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    cooldownManager.CleanupExpiredCooldowns();\n\
      \    // ... continue with rest of loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Cleanup Trigger
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    // Perform cleanup before player\
      \ logs out\n    cooldownManager.CleanupExpiredCooldowns();\n    // Proceed with\
      \ logout sequence\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient and should not block the main game
    thread for extended periods. It internally uses optimized data structures to quickly
    identify and remove expired cooldowns. Developers should be aware that calling
    this method manually may interfere with automatic cleanup schedules, potentially
    leading to inconsistent cooldown states if not handled carefully.
  warnings: Calling CleanupExpiredCooldowns manually too frequently can cause performance
    degradation due to unnecessary iterations over the cooldown list. Additionally,
    if cooldowns are being modified or accessed concurrently by other threads without
    proper synchronization, calling this method might result in race conditions or
    undefined behavior.
