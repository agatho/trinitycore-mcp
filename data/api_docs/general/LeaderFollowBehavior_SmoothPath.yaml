  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SmoothPath
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SmoothPath(int & path)
documentation:
  brief: Smooths the path for a leader-follower behavior to ensure fluid movement.
  description: The SmoothPath method processes and refines the current path stored
    in the provided integer reference to improve movement quality for units following
    a leader. This method is typically used within AI behaviors to optimize pathfinding
    results, reducing jagged or unnatural movement patterns. It modifies the path
    data in-place, ensuring that follower units move more smoothly along the calculated
    route while maintaining proximity to the leader.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to an integer representing the current path index or identifier
      used by the leader-follower behavior system. This value is modified in-place
      to reflect the smoothed path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of SmoothPath
    code: 'int currentPath = 5;

      leaderFollowBehavior->SmoothPath(currentPath);

      // The ''currentPath'' variable is now updated with the smoothed path index.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid path has already been calculated and stored
    in the provided integer reference. It does not perform pathfinding itself but
    rather refines existing path data for better movement quality.
