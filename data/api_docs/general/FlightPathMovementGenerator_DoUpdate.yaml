  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: DoUpdate
  signature: bool FlightPathMovementGenerator::DoUpdate(Player * param0, uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the flight path movement generator for a player, handling flight
    progress and waypoint transitions.
  description: The DoUpdate method is responsible for advancing the flight path movement
    logic for a player character. It processes the current flight path state, updates
    the player's position along the path, handles waypoint completion checks, and
    manages the transition between waypoints. This method is typically called during
    the game loop to ensure smooth flight movement. The method returns true if the
    flight path is still in progress or has been successfully updated, and false when
    the flight path is completed or encounters an error. It integrates with the player's
    movement system to maintain accurate positioning during flight animations.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose flight path movement is being
      updated
  - name: param1
    description: Update time delta in milliseconds since last update, used for interpolation
      and timing calculations
  returns: Returns true if the flight path movement was successfully updated and continues,
    false when the flight path is completed or has encountered an error condition
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerFlightUpdate(Player* player, uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == FLIGHT_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        FlightPathMovementGenerator* flightGen\
      \ = static_cast<FlightPathMovementGenerator*>(\n            player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      \        flightGen->DoUpdate(player, diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator system and should only be called
    on players with active flight paths. The update delta parameter is crucial for
    maintaining consistent timing across different frame rates. The method internally
    manages waypoint transitions and may trigger callbacks when waypoints are reached.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on players who are not currently in flight
    path movement mode, as it may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper
    synchronization with the game loop to avoid timing inconsistencies during updates.
