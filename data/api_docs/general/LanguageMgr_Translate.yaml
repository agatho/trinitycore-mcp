  class: LanguageMgr
  method: Translate
  signature: std::string LanguageMgr::Translate(const std::string & msg, uint32 language,
    LocaleConstant locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Translates a message string into the specified language and locale.
  description: The Translate method converts a given message string into the target
    language and locale. It uses the internal language translation system to provide
    localized text for various game elements such as NPC dialogues, system messages,
    or player chat. The method takes into account the provided language identifier
    and locale settings to determine how the message should be translated. This functionality
    is essential for supporting multiple languages in World of Warcraft and ensures
    that players receive content in their preferred language. The method does not
    modify the original string but returns a new translated version.
  parameters:
  - name: msg
    description: The input message string to be translated. This should contain the
      text that needs localization.
  - name: language
    description: The target language identifier (e.g., LANG_COMMON, LANG_ORCISH) for
      which the translation is requested.
  - name: locale
    description: The locale constant specifying the regional variant of the language
      (e.g., LOCALE_en, LOCALE_fr).
  returns: A std::string containing the translated version of the input message. If
    no translation is found, it may return the original message or an empty string
    depending on implementation behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Translation Example
    code: std::string translated = LanguageMgr::instance()->Translate("Hello", LANG_COMMON,
      LOCALE_en);
    language: cpp
  - title: NPC Dialogue Translation
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      std::string greeting = LanguageMgr::instance()->Translate("Welcome to our realm!",
      player->GetSession()->GetSessionDbcLocale(), player->GetSession()->GetSessionDbcLocale());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's language translation database which
    must be properly populated with translations for each supported language. The
    method is typically used in conjunction with player session data to ensure correct
    localization. Performance-wise, it may involve lookups in translation tables and
    should be used judiciously in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided language and locale parameters are valid identifiers;
    invalid values might result in untranslated strings or undefined behavior. The
    method assumes that translation entries exist for the specified language/locale
    combination, otherwise it may return unexpected results.
