documentation:
  brief: Returns the group reference identifier for the player
  description: The GetGroupRef method retrieves the unique identifier that represents
    the player's current group membership. This value corresponds to the group's reference
    ID in the TrinityCore database system, allowing developers to track and manage
    player group assignments within the game world. The method is commonly used in
    group-related operations such as checking group status, managing party members,
    or implementing group-based gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the integer identifier of the player's group
    reference, which corresponds to the group's ID in the database. This value can
    be used to determine if a player is part of a group and to access group-related
    data for further processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Reference Retrieval
    code: "int groupRef = player->GetGroupRef();\nif (groupRef > 0)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is in a group\n    // Do something with the group reference\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Reference Usage in Group Management
    code: "int groupRef = player->GetGroupRef();\nif (groupRef == 0)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is not in any group\n    // Handle accordingly\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is in a valid group\n    // Access group data using the reference\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an integer value, meaning modifications
    to the returned value will affect the player's group reference directly. The method
    should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where group membership
    may change during execution.
  warnings: Care should be taken when modifying the returned value as it directly
    affects the player's group reference. This method should not be used for determining
    group membership status without checking if the returned value is zero, as a zero
    value indicates no group membership.
