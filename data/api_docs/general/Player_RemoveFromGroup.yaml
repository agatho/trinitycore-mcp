  brief: Removes the player from their current group.
  description: This method removes the player from their current group, effectively
    ending the group relationship. It is typically used when a player wishes to leave
    a group or when a group member is removed from the group for various reasons such
    as disbanding the group or kicking members. The method ensures that the player's
    group membership is properly updated and that any associated group information
    is cleared.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RemoveFromGroup();

      // Player is now removed from their group'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method does not perform any checks on whether the player actually has
    a group to remove from. It simply removes the player from the group structure
    and updates internal state accordingly.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may affect group mechanics
    such as loot distribution or group experience sharing. It is recommended to ensure
    that the player is not in a group before calling this method, especially when
    dealing with group members who are being removed.
