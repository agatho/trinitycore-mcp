documentation:
  brief: Initializes all rogue profession skills and related data for a player
  description: The InitializeRogueProfessions method sets up and configures all profession-related
    data specific to rogue characters within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    loading base skill levels, unlocking profession abilities, setting up specialization
    requirements, and initializing any rogue-specific profession mechanics such as
    stealth-based crafting or poison creation. The method ensures that rogue players
    have proper access to their profession trees and associated skills upon character
    initialization or login. It typically runs during player loading sequences and
    handles the synchronization of profession data with the player's current game
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: "void SomePlayerHandler::OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    ProfessionManager::InitializeRogueProfessions();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during player initialization or login sequences.
    It assumes that the player object is properly constructed and has valid profession
    data. The method may internally call other utility functions to validate skill
    levels and unlock profession-specific abilities.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper initialization contexts may lead
    to inconsistent profession states or missing skill unlocks. Ensure that all prerequisite
    systems (like player data loading) are complete before invoking this method.
