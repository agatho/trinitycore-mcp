  signature: bool LearningAnalytics::DetectPlateau(const std::deque<LearningDataPoint>
    & points) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether learning progress has reached a plateau based on historical
    data points.
  description: The DetectPlateau method evaluates a sequence of learning data points
    to identify if the player's learning progress has stagnated or plateaued. It analyzes
    trends in the provided data to determine if further improvements are unlikely,
    which can be useful for adjusting game difficulty, providing feedback, or modifying
    learning paths. The method requires a minimum number of data points to make an
    accurate assessment and may use statistical analysis or trend detection algorithms
    to evaluate progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the learning progress has reached a plateau, indicating
    minimal improvement over recent data points; otherwise returns false if progress
    continues to show meaningful increases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "std::deque<LearningDataPoint> dataPoints;\n// Populate dataPoints with\
      \ learning metrics\nbool isPlateau = analytics.DetectPlateau(dataPoints);\n\
      if (isPlateau) {\n    // Handle plateau scenario\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the input data points are ordered chronologically
    and that sufficient data exists to perform meaningful trend analysis. Performance
    may be affected by large data sets, as the method may need to process multiple
    data points for statistical evaluation.
  warnings: Ensure that the data points provided contain valid learning metrics and
    are not empty or stale, as this could lead to incorrect plateau detection results.
