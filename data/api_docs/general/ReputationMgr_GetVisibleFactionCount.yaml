documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of visible reputation factions for the player
  description: The GetVisibleFactionCount method retrieves the number of reputation
    factions that are currently visible to the player in their character's reputation
    list. This count includes all factions that have been discovered and are shown
    in the game's reputation UI, excluding hidden or locked factions. The method is
    typically used by the client to determine how many faction entries should be displayed
    in the reputation tab of the character sheet. It does not account for factions
    that may be temporarily hidden due to quest progress or other game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the total number of visible reputation factions
    for the player. This value corresponds to the count of factions displayed in the
    character's reputation list UI.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint8 visibleFactions = player->GetReputationMgr().GetVisibleFactionCount();\n\
      if (visibleFactions > 0)\n{\n    // Process visible factions\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player has %u visible reputation factions.\", visibleFactions);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Faction Visibility
    code: "ReputationMgr& repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nuint8 totalVisible\
      \ = repMgr.GetVisibleFactionCount();\nuint8 totalKnown = repMgr.GetReputationListSize();\n\
      \nif (totalVisible < totalKnown)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has %u known\
      \ factions but only %u visible.\", totalKnown, totalVisible);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during UI updates and should have minimal
    performance impact. The returned value reflects the current state of faction visibility
    in the player's reputation list and can change when factions are discovered or
    become hidden through gameplay events.
