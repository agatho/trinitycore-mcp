  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleMovementLaggers(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles movement laggers in a group during instance coordination.
  description: The HandleMovementLaggers method processes and manages players who
    are experiencing movement lag or delays within a group during instance encounters.
    This method is typically invoked as part of the instance coordination system to
    ensure that all group members are synchronized and that lagging players do not
    disrupt the overall group performance or encounter mechanics. It may adjust player
    positions, apply temporary movement restrictions, or trigger corrective actions
    to maintain game balance and fairness. The method operates on a Group object which
    represents the current group of players participating in the instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance coordination
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup())\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->HandleMovementLaggers(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the instance coordination system
    when movement synchronization issues are detected. It may involve checking player
    movement data, comparing against expected positions, and applying corrective measures
    to maintain group integrity during encounters.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method directly as it may have
    side effects on player movement and positioning. Ensure that the group parameter
    is valid and that the method is called in appropriate contexts where movement
    lagging could occur.
