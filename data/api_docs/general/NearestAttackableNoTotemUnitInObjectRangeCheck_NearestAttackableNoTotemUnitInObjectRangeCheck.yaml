  class: NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  method: NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck::NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck(const
    int * obj, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for the nearest attackable unit that is not a totem within
    a specified object range.
  description: The NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck class constructor
    initializes a predicate used to find the closest attackable unit (excluding totems)
    within a given range of a specified object. This functionality is commonly used
    in AI behavior scripts for creatures or NPCs to locate targets for attacks or
    actions. The check evaluates units based on their relationship to the provided
    object, ensuring that only valid, non-totem targets are considered. It's typically
    employed in combat logic where totems should be ignored as potential attack targets.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an object (such as a creature or player) used as the reference
      point for range checking. Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance within which to search for attackable units. Must
      be a positive value representing the radius of the search area.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      float searchRange = 20.0f;

      NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck check(&creature->GetGUID(), searchRange);

      Unit* target = creature->SelectNearestTarget(&check);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is part of TrinityCore's AI system and relies on internal unit
    checking mechanisms. It does not perform direct range calculations but uses the
    underlying game engine's target selection logic. The object reference must remain
    valid during the lifetime of this check.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'obj' parameter points to a valid object, as passing a
    null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that totems are
    excluded from consideration, which may affect AI targeting decisions in certain
    scenarios.
