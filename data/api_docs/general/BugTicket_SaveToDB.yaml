documentation:
  brief: Saves the bug ticket data to the database.
  description: "The SaveToDB method persists the current state of a BugTicket object\
    \ into the TrinityCore database. This method is typically invoked when a player\
    \ submits a bug report through the in-game interface, ensuring that all relevant\
    \ information about the bug\u2014such as the player's account ID, the bug description,\
    \ and the time it was reported\u2014is stored for later retrieval by GMs or developers.\
    \ The method does not return any value and operates directly on the object's internal\
    \ data members, which must be properly initialized before calling this function.\
    \ It is generally used in conjunction with other ticket management methods to\
    \ complete the full lifecycle of a bug report."

  - title: Saving a Bug Ticket After Creation
    code: 'BugTicket* ticket = new BugTicket();

      ticket->SetPlayerGUID(playerGuid);

      ticket->SetDescription("Game crashes when entering dungeon.");

      ticket->SetPosition(x, y, z);

      ticket->SaveToDB(); // Saves to database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    that the necessary tables for storing bug tickets exist. It should only be called
    after all relevant fields of the BugTicket object have been populated with valid
    data.
  warnings: Calling SaveToDB without properly setting required fields may result in
    incomplete or invalid entries in the database, potentially causing issues during
    retrieval or processing of the ticket.
