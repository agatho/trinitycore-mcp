documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific quest is associated with the result set.
  description: The HasQuest method determines whether a given quest identifier exists
    within the QuestRelationResult collection. This method is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to verify the presence of a quest in a set
    of related quests, such as those returned by quest query functions or during quest
    interaction processing. It performs a lookup operation against the internal quest
    ID storage and returns true if the specified quest ID is found, false otherwise.
    The method is commonly employed in quest handling logic where it's necessary to
    validate whether a particular quest has been assigned or is relevant to the current
    context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest ID exists within the QuestRelationResult
    collection; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (questResult.HasQuest(12345)) {\n    // Quest 12345 is associated with\
      \ this result\n    printf(\"Quest 12345 found in results\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerQuests(Player* player) {\n    QuestRelationResult result\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetQuestRelations(player->GetGUID());\n    if (result.HasQuest(8765))\
      \ {\n        // Player has quest 8765 in their active quests\n        player->CompleteQuest(8765);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal quest list, so
    performance may degrade with large collections. It's recommended to cache results
    when checking multiple quests for the same object. The method assumes that quest
    IDs are valid and non-zero.
  warnings: Ensure that the QuestRelationResult object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or corrupted object may
    lead to undefined behavior. This method does not validate the existence of the
    quest in the database, only its presence in the current result set.
