documentation:
  brief: Returns the target unit currently under fixate effect.
  description: The GetFixateTarget method retrieves the specific unit that is currently
    being fixated by the creature or player. This method is typically used in threat
    management systems to identify which target is under the influence of a fixate
    ability, such as those found in boss encounters or certain mob abilities. The
    returned unit represents the current fixate target and can be used for various
    gameplay mechanics including tracking, targeting, and managing combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit object that is currently under fixate effect.
    If no fixate target exists, this method returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = threatManager->GetFixateTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    //\
      \ Do something with the fixate target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a fixate effect is active on the unit.
    Implementation details include checking for valid fixate targets and ensuring
    proper handling of null pointers.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return nullptr if
    no fixate target exists, which could lead to runtime errors if not properly handled.
