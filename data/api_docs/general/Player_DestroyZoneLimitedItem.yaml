  class: Player
  method: DestroyZoneLimitedItem
  signature: void Player::DestroyZoneLimitedItem(bool update, uint32 new_zone)
documentation:
  brief: Destroys zone-limited items in the player's inventory when they change zones.
  description: The DestroyZoneLimitedItem method removes items from a player's inventory
    that are restricted to specific zones. This typically occurs when a player moves
    to a new zone where certain items are no longer valid or allowed. The method can
    optionally update the player's inventory state and accepts a new zone ID to determine
    which items should be destroyed. Zone-limited items often include quest items,
    temporary equipment, or items that are only usable within specific areas of the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: update
    description: If true, sends inventory updates to the player client. If false,
      performs the destruction without updating the UI.
  - name: new_zone
    description: The ID of the new zone the player is entering. Items that are restricted
      to other zones will be destroyed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Zone Change
    code: "void Player::OnZoneChange(uint32 newZoneId)\n{\n    DestroyZoneLimitedItem(true,\
      \ newZoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Item Destruction
    code: "if (player->HasItemInInventory(ITEM_ID_ZONE_RESTRICTED))\n{\n    player->DestroyZoneLimitedItem(false,\
      \ newZoneId);\n}\n// Perform additional zone-specific logic here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during zone transitions. Developers
    should be aware that destroying items may have implications for quest progress
    or item tracking systems. The method may iterate through all inventory slots and
    check item zone restrictions, which could impact performance if a player has many
    items.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper context may cause unexpected
    behavior in quest systems or item tracking. Ensure that zone transitions are properly
    handled before calling this function to avoid breaking quest objectives or item
    availability logic.
