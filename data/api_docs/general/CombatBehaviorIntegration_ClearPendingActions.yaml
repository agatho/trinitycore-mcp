documentation:
  brief: Clears all pending combat actions from the integration's action queue
  description: The ClearPendingActions method removes all queued combat behaviors
    and actions that have been scheduled but not yet executed. This method is typically
    used during combat state transitions, such as when a creature enters or exits
    combat, or when resetting the AI behavior. It ensures that no stale or outdated
    actions remain in the pending queue, preventing unexpected behavior during combat
    sequences. The method does not affect currently executing actions or active combat
    states, only those that are waiting to be processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat reset
    code: "void CreatureAI::ResetCombat()\n{\n    m_combatBehaviorIntegration.ClearPendingActions();\n\
      \    // Other reset logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing actions before entering new combat state
    code: "void Unit::EnterCombat(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (m_combatBehaviorIntegration.HasPendingActions())\n\
      \    {\n        m_combatBehaviorIntegration.ClearPendingActions();\n    }\n\
      \    // Proceed with new combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a thread-safe queue structure and should be called
    from the main game thread or within a synchronized context. Performance is generally
    optimal as it performs a simple clear operation on an internal container, but
    frequent calls may indicate improper AI state management.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat execution may lead to unexpected
    behavior if pending actions are critical for maintaining proper combat flow. Ensure
    that no important actions are queued before clearing them.
