  class: Action
  method: DoSay
  signature: bool Action::DoSay(BotAI * ai, const std::string & text)
documentation:
  brief: Makes the bot say a specified message in the game world.
  description: The DoSay method allows a bot AI to communicate by sending a text message
    to the game world. This method is typically used for bots to announce their actions,
    state changes, or other relevant information to players in the vicinity. The method
    returns true if the message was successfully queued for delivery, and false otherwise.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with other AI behaviors to provide contextual
    feedback during bot gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that is invoking this method. Used
      to access the bot's context and communication systems.
  - name: text
    description: The string message that the bot will say. This should be a valid
      UTF-8 encoded string containing the desired text to display in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the message was successfully queued for sending, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the AI system is not initialized or
    if there are communication errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DoSay
    code: "if (action->DoSay(ai, \"I am attacking the target!\")) {\n    // Message\
      \ was queued successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using DoSay with dynamic content
    code: 'std::string message = "Health is at " + std::to_string(bot->GetHealth())
      + "%";

      action->DoSay(ai, message);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying AI system's ability to send messages.
    It does not guarantee immediate delivery or visibility to all players in the area.
    The actual message may be delayed depending on server load and network conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the text parameter is properly sanitized to avoid injection
    attacks or invalid characters that could cause client-side issues. Avoid sending
    excessive messages in quick succession as this may overwhelm the chat system.
