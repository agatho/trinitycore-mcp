  class: PaladinAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void PaladinAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes Paladin AI behavior when entering combat with a target.
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a Paladin AI character begins
    combat with a target. This method sets up the initial combat state for the paladin,
    including initializing any necessary variables, preparing ability usage patterns,
    and potentially triggering specific combat behaviors based on the paladin's class
    abilities and role. The method typically runs once at the start of each combat
    encounter to ensure proper AI initialization before other combat logic is executed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity that initiated combat with this paladin
      AI. This parameter represents the unit against which the paladin will engage
      in combat and may be used to determine initial targeting behavior or ability
      selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void PaladinAI::OnCombatStart(int* target)\n{\n    // Initialize combat\
      \ state\n    m_combatStartTime = getMSTime();\n    m_targetGuid = *target;\n\
      \    // Begin combat behavior\n    DoCombatBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core AI system when a paladin enters
    combat mode. It's important to note that this method may be overridden in custom
    AI implementations, and any custom logic should properly initialize all required
    variables before calling base class methods.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before using it, as dereferencing
    an invalid pointer can cause crashes. Also, avoid performing heavy operations
    within this method since it's called during combat initialization and could affect
    performance.
