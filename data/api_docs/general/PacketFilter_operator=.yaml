documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one PacketFilter object to another
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of a PacketFilter
    object, transferring all internal state and data from the right-hand side object
    to the left-hand side object. This method is essential for managing PacketFilter
    instances in scenarios where multiple objects need to reference the same filtering
    criteria or packet handling rules. In the context of TrinityCore's networking
    subsystem, this operation ensures that packet filters can be efficiently copied
    and reassigned while maintaining consistent filtering behavior across different
    parts of the game server's network processing pipeline.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The source PacketFilter object whose contents will be copied to this
      object. This parameter must be a valid, initialized PacketFilter instance.
  returns: A reference to the current PacketFilter object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'PacketFilter filter1;

      PacketFilter filter2;

      filter2 = filter1; // Assigns contents of filter1 to filter2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'PacketFilter filter1, filter2, filter3;

      filter3 = filter2 = filter1; // Chained assignment operation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely implements deep copying semantics to ensure that internal
    data structures are properly duplicated. The implementation should handle potential
    memory management concerns and avoid shallow copy issues that could lead to dangling
    references or double-free errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the source PacketFilter object is in a valid state before
    assignment, as invalid states may result in undefined behavior. Be cautious when
    assigning to self-referencing objects (filter = filter), which should be avoided
    unless explicitly supported by the implementation.
