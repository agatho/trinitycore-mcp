  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: UpdateInstanceProgress
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::UpdateInstanceProgress(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of an instance for a given group, typically tracking
    completion status and rewards.
  description: The UpdateInstanceProgress method is responsible for updating the instance
    progress tracking for a specified group within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method likely handles the synchronization of instance completion data, including
    boss kills, objectives met, and reward eligibility. It ensures that all players
    in the group receive consistent progress updates and that the server maintains
    accurate state information for instance-based content such as raids or dungeons.
    The method may also trigger related events or notifications to inform the game
    world about changes in instance status.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose instance progress needs to be updated.
      Must not be null and should represent a valid group with members currently inside
      an instance.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance completion handler
    code: "void OnBossKill(Group* group)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::UpdateInstanceProgress(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating progress after a major objective is completed
    code: "void HandleObjectiveComplete(Player* player, uint32 objectiveId)\n{\n \
      \   Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->isRaidGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        InstanceCoordination::UpdateInstanceProgress(group);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal instance tracking systems and
    may involve database updates to persist progress changes. It should only be called
    when group members are actually inside an instance, otherwise it might cause unexpected
    behavior or errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is valid and contains players
    before invoking this method.
