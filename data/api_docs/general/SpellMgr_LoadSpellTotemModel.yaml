documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell totem model data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadSpellTotemModel method is responsible for loading all spell
    totem model associations from the database into internal memory structures. This
    method ensures that when a player casts a spell requiring a totem, the correct
    visual model is displayed. It typically runs during server startup or database
    reload operations. The method processes data related to which spells are associated
    with specific totem models and stores this information for quick lookup during
    gameplay. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper visual representation
    of totems summoned by spells like Totem of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellMgr()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellTotemModel();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations. It's important to note that this method modifies internal data structures
    and should not be called concurrently with other spell-related methods that access
    the same data. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and contains valid totem model data.
  warnings: This method should only be invoked during server initialization or when
    reloading spell data from the database. Calling it during active gameplay may
    cause unexpected behavior or performance issues due to internal data structure
    modifications. Ensure that all required database tables are properly populated
    before calling this method.
