  signature: uint32 SpellMgr::GetFirstSpellInChain(uint32 spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the first spell in a spell chain for the given spell ID.
  description: The GetFirstSpellInChain method retrieves the initial spell in a spell
    chain associated with the provided spell ID. In World of Warcraft, certain spells
    are part of chains where one spell leads to another through upgrades or transformations.
    This method allows developers to find the base spell that starts such a chain,
    which is useful for spell handling, aura management, and ensuring correct spell
    progression logic. The method performs a lookup in the internal spell chain data
    structure maintained by the SpellMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the spell ID of the first spell in the chain. If the input spell_id
    does not belong to any chain or is invalid, it returns the same spell_id passed
    as parameter.
  examples:
  - title: Finding the base spell in a chain
    code: "uint32 baseSpellId = sSpellMgr->GetFirstSpellInChain(12345); // Assuming\
      \ 12345 is part of a spell chain\nif (baseSpellId != 12345)\n{\n    // This\
      \ spell is not the first in its chain\n    // baseSpellId now contains the ID\
      \ of the first spell in the chain\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell chain definitions stored in the database
    or hardcoded structures. It's important to ensure that the input spell_id is valid
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation may
    involve lookups in hash tables or other optimized data structures for performance.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spell ID might return
    the same ID, which could be misleading if not checked properly. Always validate
    spell IDs before using this function in critical gameplay logic.
