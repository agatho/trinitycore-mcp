  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::ProcessGroupCommunication(PlayerbotGroup
    & group)
documentation:
  brief: Processes communication within a player bot group, handling messages and
    updates between group members.
  description: The ProcessGroupCommunication method manages the flow of information
    within a player bot group. It handles various types of group communications such
    as chat messages, status updates, and strategic coordination between bots in the
    same group. This method ensures that all group members stay synchronized with
    each other's actions and decisions. The implementation likely checks for new messages,
    processes them according to group policies, and may update group state or trigger
    bot behavior changes based on received information. It operates as part of the
    automated player bot system in TrinityCore, maintaining group cohesion and coordination.

  - title: Basic Group Communication Processing
    code: "PlayerbotGroupManager* groupManager = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();\n\
      PlayerbotGroup group = groupManager->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif (group.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    groupManager->ProcessGroupCommunication(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the bot AI system to maintain
    group synchronization. It may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety
    when accessing shared group data structures. Performance considerations include
    minimizing communication overhead and avoiding blocking operations during critical
    gameplay moments.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper group validation may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that the provided group is
    valid and properly initialized. Improper use could cause synchronization issues
    between bots in the same group.
