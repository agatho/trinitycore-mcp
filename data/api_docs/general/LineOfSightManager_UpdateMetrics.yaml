  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void LineOfSightManager::UpdateMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates line-of-sight metrics for the manager's tracked objects.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method recalculates and refreshes internal line-of-sight
    statistics and data structures for all objects currently managed by the LineOfSightManager.
    This includes updating visibility states, calculating obstruction checks, and
    maintaining accurate spatial relationships between entities. The method is typically
    invoked during game ticks or when significant world state changes occur that may
    affect visibility. It ensures that the manager's internal state remains consistent
    with the current game environment and object positions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    m_lineOfSightManager.UpdateMetrics();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform expensive calculations involving spatial queries
    and collision detection. It should be called sparingly to avoid performance degradation.
    The method is designed to be thread-safe in multi-threaded environments where
    appropriate locking mechanisms are in place.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    significant performance overhead. Ensure that visibility updates are only triggered
    when necessary, such as after object movement or world state changes.
