documentation:
  brief: Applies visual effects for periodic food spells to the aura's target.
  description: The HandlePeriodicFoodSpellVisualKit method is responsible for managing
    the visual representation of periodic food-related auras on a Unit. This method
    ensures that appropriate spell visual kits are applied to the target unit when
    a periodic food effect is active, such as those from food buffs or consumable
    items that provide ongoing benefits. It typically handles the display of visual
    effects like particles, animations, or other graphical feedback that corresponds
    to the food's aura state. The method operates within the context of the UnitAura
    system and is invoked during aura update cycles when periodic effects are processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Update
    code: "void MyPeriodicFoodAura::HandlePeriodicFoodSpellVisualKit()\n{\n    //\
      \ This method is automatically called during aura updates\n    // for periodic\
      \ food auras\n    if (GetTarget() && GetSpellInfo())\n    {\n        // Apply\
      \ visual kit to target\n        GetTarget()->PlaySpellVisualKit(GetSpellInfo()->GetSpellVisualKit(),\
      \ 0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore aura system
    during periodic effect updates. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom aura behavior. The visual kit applied depends on the
    spell's configuration and may vary based on the target's state or environment.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method outside of the standard aura update cycle
    can lead to inconsistent visual states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that any
    custom implementation respects the existing aura lifecycle management.
