  class: MageAI
  method: UseBanish
  signature: void MageAI::UseBanish(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the banish spell on a target unit for Mage AI.
  description: The UseBanish method is responsible for casting the banish spell on
    a specified target unit within the Mage AI system. This method typically represents
    the AI's decision-making process to use the banish ability, which removes the
    target from combat and prevents them from taking actions for a short duration.
    The method likely checks if the spell is available, validates the target, and
    initiates the spell casting sequence. It is part of the Mage's combat AI behavior
    and is usually invoked during combat situations when the AI determines that banish
    would be beneficial.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be targeted by the banish spell.
      This must be a valid unit in the game world, typically an enemy creature or
      player character.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        if (me->IsWithinLOS(target) && me->IsWithinMeleeRange(target))\n\
      \        {\n            UseBanish(target);\n        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the Mage AI implementation and assumes that the AI
    has already determined that banish is an appropriate spell to cast. The actual
    spell casting logic may be handled by the base AI class or through internal spell
    management systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also verify that the
    spell is available and not on cooldown before invoking this method.
