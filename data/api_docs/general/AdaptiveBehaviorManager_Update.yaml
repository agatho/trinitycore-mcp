  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: Update
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::Update(uint32 diff, const CombatMetrics
    & metrics, CombatSituation situation)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the adaptive behavior manager with current combat metrics and situation
    data.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and reacting to real-time
    combat data within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager class. It takes in a time delta,
    combat metrics, and current combat situation to adjust AI behaviors dynamically.
    This method serves as the core update loop for adaptive AI decision-making during
    combat encounters. The implementation likely evaluates incoming combat data against
    internal behavior states and modifies AI strategies accordingly. It is typically
    called from the main game loop or AI update cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since last update call, used to calculate
      timing-based behaviors and cooldowns
  - name: metrics
    description: CombatMetrics object containing real-time combat statistics such
      as health, damage dealt/recv, threat levels, and other relevant combat data
  - name: situation
    description: CombatSituation enum or structure describing current combat context
      including target status, positioning, and environmental factors affecting behavior
      decisions
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Update Call
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    CombatMetrics metrics = GetCombatMetrics();\n\
      \    CombatSituation situation = GetCurrentCombatSituation();\n    adaptiveBehaviorManager.Update(diff,\
      \ metrics, situation);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n    \n    CombatMetrics metrics = GetCombatMetrics();\n    CombatSituation\
      \ situation = GetCombatSituation();\n    adaptiveBehaviorManager.Update(diff,\
      \ metrics, situation);\n    \n    // Continue with normal AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during combat scenarios.
    The CombatMetrics and CombatSituation parameters should be updated before calling
    this method for accurate behavior adaptation. Performance is critical as this
    method may be called multiple times per game tick.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatMetrics object contains valid data before passing
    it to this method, as invalid metrics could lead to unpredictable AI behavior.
    The method modifies internal state and should not be called from multiple threads
    simultaneously without proper synchronization.
