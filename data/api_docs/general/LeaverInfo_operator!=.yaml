  signature: bool LeaverInfo::operator!=(const LeaverInfo & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two LeaverInfo objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this LeaverInfo
    object and another LeaverInfo object to determine if they are not equal. It typically
    compares the internal data members of both objects, such as player GUIDs or leave
    timestamps, to decide whether the two instances represent different leaver events.
    This operator is commonly used in container classes or when comparing game state
    changes related to player disconnections or leaving groups. The comparison is
    performed in a const context, meaning it does not modify either object during
    evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The LeaverInfo object to compare against this instance.
  returns: Returns true if the two LeaverInfo objects are not equal; otherwise returns
    false. The comparison is based on internal member values such as player identifiers
    or timestamps.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: 'LeaverInfo leftInfo;

      LeaverInfo rightInfo;

      bool result = (leftInfo != rightInfo); // Returns true if objects are different'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a container comparison
    code: 'std::vector<LeaverInfo> leavers;

      LeaverInfo newLeaver;

      // ... populate leavers ...

      bool isNewLeaverUnique = std::find(leavers.begin(), leavers.end(), newLeaver)
      == leavers.end();

      // This uses operator!= internally to check for uniqueness'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using a member-wise comparison of the
    LeaverInfo's data members. It's important to note that the behavior assumes all
    relevant fields are properly initialized and comparable. If any field uses custom
    comparison logic, that logic must be consistent with this operator.
