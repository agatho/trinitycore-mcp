  signature: void SpawnCircuitBreaker::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the spawn circuit breaker state to its initial condition.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the internal state of
    the SpawnCircuitBreaker class. This typically involves clearing any recorded failure
    counts, resetting timers, and restoring the circuit breaker to an open or closed
    state based on predefined logic. The method is commonly used after a system recovery
    or when manually resetting the breaker's monitoring mechanism. It ensures that
    subsequent spawn attempts are evaluated fresh without carrying forward previous
    failure states.

    code: 'SpawnCircuitBreaker breaker;

      breaker.Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve resetting internal counters and timers. It is typically invoked
    during system initialization or after a successful recovery from a failure state.
