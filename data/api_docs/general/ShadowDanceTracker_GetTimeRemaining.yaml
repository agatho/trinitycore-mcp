  class: ShadowDanceTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 ShadowDanceTracker::GetTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the Shadow Dance effect.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left on the Shadow
    Dance buff, which is a special ability that enhances a player's damage output
    and movement speed. This value represents how much time is left before the effect
    expires. The returned value is typically used by the game engine to update UI
    elements such as cooldown timers or buff indicators. The method does not modify
    any internal state and can be called safely at any time during the buff's duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the milliseconds remaining until the Shadow
    Dance effect expires. If the effect is not active, this value will typically be
    zero or a very small number.
  examples:
  - title: Check Remaining Time Before Casting
    code: "if (ShadowDanceTracker* tracker = player->GetShadowDanceTracker()) {\n\
      \    uint32 remaining = tracker->GetTimeRemaining();\n    if (remaining > 5000)\
      \ // More than 5 seconds left\n        DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other Shadow Dance tracking
    utilities to determine optimal timing for reapplying the buff or triggering abilities
    that benefit from its effects. The value returned is in milliseconds and should
    be converted to seconds if needed for display purposes.
