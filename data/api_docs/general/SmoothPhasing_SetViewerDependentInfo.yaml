  class: SmoothPhasing
  method: SetViewerDependentInfo
  signature: void SmoothPhasing::SetViewerDependentInfo(ObjectGuid seer, const SmoothPhasingInfo
    & info)
documentation:
  brief: Sets viewer-dependent phasing information for a specific object guid.
  description: The SetViewerDependentInfo method updates or initializes the phasing
    data associated with a particular object GUID, typically used in conjunction with
    smooth phasing mechanics to control how objects are displayed or hidden based
    on the viewer's perspective. This method is crucial for implementing dynamic visibility
    systems where certain game elements should only be visible to specific players
    or under certain conditions. It allows for fine-grained control over object visibility
    within the TrinityCore framework, particularly useful in scenarios involving phased
    zones, world events, or custom phasing logic.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: The ObjectGuid of the viewer or observer for whom the phasing information
      is being set. This identifies which entity will be affected by the phasing changes.
  - name: info
    description: A reference to a SmoothPhasingInfo structure containing the phasing
      data to be applied. This includes details such as phase masks, visibility flags,
      and other relevant phasing parameters for the specified seer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Viewer-Dependent Phasing Info
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      SmoothPhasingInfo phasingInfo;

      phasingInfo.PhaseMask = 0x00000001;

      phasingInfo.Flags = 0x0001;

      smoothPhasing->SetViewerDependentInfo(playerGuid, phasingInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever the phasing state for a specific viewer
    needs to be updated. It's typically invoked during player login, zone changes,
    or when game events modify visibility rules. The SmoothPhasing system relies on
    this information to determine which objects are visible to each individual player.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the phase mask or flags can lead to unexpected visibility
    behavior for players, potentially causing objects to appear or disappear inappropriately.
    Ensure that phasing data is properly synchronized with game logic and event systems.
