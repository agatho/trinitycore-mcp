  class: NPCEventBus
  method: NPCEventBus
  signature: void NPCEventBus::NPCEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NPCEventBus class for handling NPC-related
    events.
  description: The NPCEventBus constructor initializes the event bus system used for
    managing and dispatching events related to non-player characters (NPCs) within
    the TrinityCore framework. This class serves as a central hub for registering
    event listeners, broadcasting events to subscribed handlers, and managing the
    lifecycle of NPC-specific events such as spawns, deaths, combat states, and quest
    interactions. The constructor sets up internal data structures necessary for event
    routing and ensures that the event bus is ready to receive and process NPC-related
    notifications from various subsystems including AI modules, quest systems, and
    world objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an NPCEventBus instance
    code: 'NPCEventBus eventBus;

      // The eventBus is now ready to handle NPC events

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    It simply sets up the internal structures needed for event handling. The actual
    event processing occurs through other methods like RegisterListener, UnregisterListener,
    and BroadcastEvent.
