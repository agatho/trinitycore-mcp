  brief: Applies necessary buffs and enhancements to the hunter bot for optimal combat
    performance.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying all
    relevant buffs, auras, and enhancements to a hunter bot character. This includes
    managing buff priorities, checking cooldowns, and ensuring that the bot maintains
    optimal stat configurations during combat. The method typically evaluates the
    current state of the bot's buffs and applies any missing or expired buffs based
    on the configured baseline rotation strategy. It ensures that the hunter has access
    to all necessary temporary stat boosts, such as strength, agility, or critical
    strike enhancements, which are crucial for maintaining high damage output and
    survivability in combat situations.
