  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetResourcePercent
  signature: float CombatSpecializationBase::GetResourcePercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current resource percentage for the combat specialization.
  description: The GetResourcePercent method computes the ratio of currently available
    resource points to the maximum possible resource points for the combat specialization.
    This value is typically used in UI elements, resource management systems, or gameplay
    mechanics that depend on resource levels. The returned float value represents
    a percentage between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no resources available and
    1.0 indicates full resource capacity. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call multiple times within a single game tick.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the current resource percentage
    for the combat specialization, where 0.0 means no resources and 1.0 means full
    capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "float resourcePercent = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->GetResourcePercent();\n\
      if (resourcePercent >= 0.75f)\n{\n    // Player has sufficient resources for\
      \ powerful abilities\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_POWERFUL_ABILITY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: UI Resource Bar Update
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nfloat\
      \ percent = spec->GetResourcePercent();\nresourceBar->SetProgress(percent);\n\
      // Update UI to reflect current resource level\nif (percent < 0.2f)\n{\n   \
      \ resourceBar->SetColor(Color::Red);\n}\nelse if (percent < 0.5f)\n{\n    resourceBar->SetColor(Color::Yellow);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    resourceBar->SetColor(Color::Green);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the combat specialization has a valid resource system
    implemented. The calculation may vary based on class-specific mechanics, such
    as mana for mages or energy for rogues. If the maximum resource value is zero,
    this method will return 0.0 to avoid division by zero errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatSpecializationBase object is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized specialization may lead
    to undefined behavior. This method should not be used in performance-critical
    sections where frequent calls might impact frame rate.
