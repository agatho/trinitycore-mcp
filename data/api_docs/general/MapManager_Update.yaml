documentation:
  brief: Updates all maps in the manager by processing their game objects and entities.
  description: The MapManager::Update method is responsible for updating the state
    of all active maps within the TrinityCore server. It processes game objects, creatures,
    players, and other entities on each map based on the time delta provided. This
    method is typically called from the main game loop to ensure that all world objects
    are properly updated with respect to the passage of time. The update mechanism
    handles movement, AI behavior, spell effects, and other time-dependent systems
    across all loaded maps.

    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    sMapMgr->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain proper
    world state. It's thread-safe as it operates on individual maps which are managed
    internally by the MapManager. Performance can be affected by the number of active
    maps and objects within them.
