documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is currently in evade mode.
  description: This method checks if a creature is in evade mode, which occurs when
    the creature has been defeated and is returning to its original position or is
    in the process of returning to its spawn point. The method is commonly used in
    AI scripts to determine if a creature should be reset or if it's safe to perform
    certain actions. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics
    and preventing creatures from straying too far from their spawn location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently in evade mode, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the creature has been defeated and is in the
    process of returning to its original spawn point or has already returned to that
    point.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsInEvadeMode())\n{\n    // Handle evade mode\n    creature->GetAI()->EnterEvadeMode();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    to manage creature behavior during combat. It's important to note that this method
    may return false even when a creature is in the process of evading, as it depends
    on the current state of the creature's AI and its position relative to its spawn
    point.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator for determining if
    a creature has been defeated. It's important to understand that being in evade
    mode doesn't necessarily mean the creature is defeated; it could also indicate
    that the creature is returning to its spawn point after being engaged in combat.
