  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetExpectedDuration
  signature: uint32 MovementRequest::GetExpectedDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the expected duration in milliseconds for a movement
    request to complete.
  description: The GetExpectedDuration method computes the anticipated time required
    for a movement request to finish executing. This value is typically derived from
    the distance between the starting and ending positions, combined with the unit's
    speed and any applicable movement modifiers. The returned duration is expressed
    in milliseconds and can be used by the game engine to schedule events, manage
    animations, or handle client-server synchronization during movement operations.
    This method does not modify the internal state of the MovementRequest object and
    is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the expected duration in milliseconds for the
    movement request to complete. Returns 0 if the movement request has no valid destination
    or if the duration cannot be calculated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MovementRequest request;\n// Assume request is properly initialized with\
      \ a destination\nuint32 duration = request.GetExpectedDuration();\nif (duration\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the duration for scheduling or UI updates\n    printf(\"\
      Expected movement time: %u ms\\n\", duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player, MovementRequest& request)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 expectedTime = request.GetExpectedDuration();\n    if (expectedTime\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        // Schedule a callback or update UI elements based on\
      \ duration\n        player->AddDelayedEvent(expectedTime, []() {\n         \
      \   // Movement completed\n        });\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate position data and speed calculations. If the
    movement request's start or end positions are invalid, the result may be inaccurate
    or zero. The duration calculation may also factor in movement types such as walking,
    running, or flying, depending on the implementation details of the MovementRequest
    class.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned duration exactly matches actual execution
    time due to potential dynamic factors like terrain, obstacles, or server load.
    This value is an estimate and should be used for non-critical timing purposes
    only.
