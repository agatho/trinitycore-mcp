  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsPathClear(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a clear line of sight exists between two points in the
    game world.
  description: The IsPathClear method evaluates whether there is an unobstructed path
    between two waypoints in the World of Warcraft environment. This function is commonly
    used by AI systems, spell casters, and movement logic to verify that targets are
    visible or reachable without being blocked by terrain, objects, or other environmental
    obstacles. It performs a raycast check from the starting point to the destination
    point, returning true if no solid obstacles are encountered along the path. The
    method assumes that both waypoints are valid positions within the game world and
    may return false if either position is invalid or outside of navigable space.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether a clear path exists between
    the specified waypoints. A return value of true means no obstacles were found
    along the path, while false indicates that at least one obstacle blocked the line
    of sight.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a target is visible
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager.IsPathClear()) {\n    // Target is visible and reachable\n\
      \    CastSpellOnTarget();\n} else {\n    // Target is obstructed, cannot cast\
      \ spell\n    MoveToClearPosition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation system and may be affected
    by the accuracy of waypoint data. Performance can vary depending on the complexity
    of the terrain between waypoints. In high-traffic areas or with many obstacles,
    this check might introduce slight delays.
  warnings: Ensure that both waypoints are valid and within the game world bounds
    before calling this method; otherwise, behavior is undefined. This function does
    not account for dynamic objects such as moving creatures or temporary environmental
    changes unless those are properly integrated into the navigation mesh.
