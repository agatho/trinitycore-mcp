  class: BGQueueInviteEvent
  method: BGQueueInviteEvent
  signature: void BGQueueInviteEvent::BGQueueInviteEvent(int pl_guid, uint32 BgInstanceGUID,
    int BgTypeId, uint32 removeTime, int queueId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battleground queue invitation event with player GUID, battleground
    instance GUID, battleground type ID, removal time, and queue ID.
  description: The BGQueueInviteEvent constructor initializes a battleground queue
    invitation event object. This method sets up internal state variables including
    the player's global unique identifier (pl_guid), the battleground instance GUID
    (BgInstanceGUID), the type of battleground (BgTypeId), the time when the invitation
    should be removed (removeTime), and the queue ID (queueId). The method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore battleground system to manage player invitations to
    queued battlegrounds. It ensures that the event is properly configured with all
    necessary data for tracking and processing battleground invitations.
  parameters:
  - name: pl_guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player being invited to a battleground
  - name: BgInstanceGUID
    description: The instance GUID of the battleground that the player is being invited
      to
  - name: BgTypeId
    description: The type ID identifying the specific battleground type (e.g., AV,
      WS, AB)
  - name: removeTime
    description: Timestamp indicating when the invitation should be removed from the
      queue
  - name: queueId
    description: Identifier for the specific battleground queue that this invitation
      belongs to
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a battleground queue invitation event
    code: BGQueueInviteEvent event(12345, 67890, BATTLEGROUND_AV, 1678886400, 1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground queue management system.
    It's typically called by the battleground queue handler when a player is invited
    to join a specific battleground instance. The removeTime parameter should be set
    to a future timestamp to ensure proper cleanup of the invitation.
