documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has enough insanity to perform an action
  description: The HasInsanity method determines whether the current player possesses
    a sufficient amount of insanity resource to execute a specific ability or effect.
    This method is typically used in gameplay mechanics where certain actions require
    a minimum insanity threshold to be met. The check is performed against the player's
    current insanity value stored within the InsanityTracker instance. The method
    does not modify any state and serves purely as a validation check for insanity-based
    gameplay elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified amount of insanity,
    false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Insanity Check
    code: "if (insanityTracker.HasInsanity(50)) {\n    // Player can perform an insanity-consuming\
      \ ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_INSANITY_ABILITY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "if (insanityTracker.HasInsanity(player->GetMaxInsanity() / 2)) {\n    //\
      \ Use ability that requires half of maximum insanity\n    player->CastSpell(nullptr,\
      \ SPELL_HALF_INSANITY_ABILITY);\n} else {\n    // Insufficient insanity, show\
      \ error message\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough insanity to use\
      \ this ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the InsanityTracker instance is properly initialized
    and contains valid insanity data. The amount parameter represents a required insanity
    value, not a consumed amount. This check is typically performed before attempting
    to consume insanity resources.
  warnings: Ensure that the insanity tracker is properly updated with current player
    values before calling this method. The method does not validate whether the amount
    parameter is positive or within reasonable bounds, so callers should ensure valid
    input values.
