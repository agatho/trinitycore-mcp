documentation:
  brief: Destroys the LFGBotManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LFGBotManager class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources held by the manager. This includes
    stopping any active bot operations, releasing references to game objects, and
    ensuring proper shutdown of internal data structures. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this method ensures that when an LFGBotManager
    instance is destroyed (typically during server shutdown or module unloading),
    no memory leaks occur and all bot-related systems are properly terminated. The
    destructor does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of LFGBotManager instance
    code: 'LFGBotManager* manager = new LFGBotManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Destructor is automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. It's important to ensure that all references to the manager are cleared
    before destruction to prevent dangling pointers. The implementation likely handles
    cleanup of internal bot threads, data containers, and any registered callbacks.
