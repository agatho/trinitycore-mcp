documentation:
  brief: Destroys a VehicleScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the VehicleScript class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources allocated during the lifetime of the script. In TrinityCore's
    vehicle system, this method ensures proper deallocation of memory and cleanup
    of vehicle-related data structures when a VehicleScript object is no longer needed.
    This typically occurs when a vehicle is removed from the game world or when the
    script is unregistered from the vehicle system. The destructor does not take any
    parameters and performs no direct operations beyond standard object cleanup.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Default Destructor Usage
    code: 'VehicleScript* script = new VehicleScript();

      // ... use the script ...

      delete script; // Triggers ~VehicleScript()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a VehicleScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually
    call this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
