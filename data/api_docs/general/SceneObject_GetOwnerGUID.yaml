documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the scene object's owner
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier of
    the entity that owns the current SceneObject. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework, SceneObjects are used to represent various in-game elements such as
    scenes, effects, or visual components that may be associated with a specific player
    or creature. This GUID can be used to identify and reference the owner within
    the game world, enabling operations like checking ownership, performing actions
    on the owner, or linking the scene object to its creator. The method is read-only
    and does not modify any internal state of the SceneObject.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the SceneObject's owner. If the SceneObject
    has no owner, this value may be zero or a special reserved value indicating null
    ownership. The exact meaning of zero or negative values depends on the implementation
    and context in which the SceneObject is used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check owner GUID
    code: "SceneObject* scene = ...; // Assume scene is initialized\nint ownerGUID\
      \ = scene->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Scene has an owner,\
      \ proceed with owner-specific logic\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ ownerGUID));\n    if (player)\n    {\n        // Do something with the owner\
      \ player\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with ObjectAccessor to retrieve
    actual object references from GUIDs. The returned GUID should be treated as an
    opaque identifier and not directly manipulated. Performance-wise, this is a fast
    operation since it only returns a stored value.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity
    through ObjectAccessor or similar mechanisms. Using an invalid GUID may lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Also note that some SceneObjects might legitimately
    have no owner (returning zero), so always check for this condition before assuming
    ownership exists.
