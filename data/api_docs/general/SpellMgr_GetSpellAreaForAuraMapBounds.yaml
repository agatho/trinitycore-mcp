    spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell area aura map bounds for a given spell ID.
  description: This method returns the SpellAreaForAuraMapBounds object associated
    with the specified spell ID. It is used internally by the TrinityCore spell system
    to manage and retrieve spell area aura mappings, which define how spells interact
    with specific areas or zones. The returned bounds typically contain information
    about the range, conditions, and applicability of a spell's area effect. This
    method does not perform any validation on the input spell ID and assumes it is
    valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellAreaForAuraMapBounds object that represents the mapping bounds for
    the specified spell ID. This structure usually contains iterators or pointers
    to the beginning and end of a container holding spell area aura data related to
    the given spell.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve spell area aura map bounds
    code: "SpellAreaForAuraMapBounds bounds = sSpellMgr->GetSpellAreaForAuraMapBounds(12345);\n\
      if (bounds.first != bounds.second)\n{\n    // Process the spell area aura data\n\
      \    for (auto itr = bounds.first; itr != bounds.second; ++itr)\n    {\n   \
      \     // Access individual spell area aura entries\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell management system and should only
    be used when working with spell area aura data. It's commonly used during spell
    processing or area effect handling within the core engine.
