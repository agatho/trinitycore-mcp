documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionManager instance and cleans up associated auction data.
  description: The AuctionManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources associated with the auction system when an AuctionManager instance
    is destroyed. This includes removing any active auctions from memory, freeing
    allocated memory for auction objects, and ensuring that no dangling pointers or
    memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this method ensures that auction data is correctly handled during server shutdown
    or when an auction house is removed from a world session. The destructor typically
    performs cleanup operations in reverse order of initialization to maintain system
    stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AuctionManager
    code: "void CleanupAuctionSystem()\n{\n    // AuctionManager instance goes out\
      \ of scope\n    // Destructor automatically called\n    AuctionManager* auctionMgr\
      \ = new AuctionManager();\n    // ... use auctionMgr ...\n    delete auctionMgr;\
      \ // Triggers ~AuctionManager()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The AuctionManager destructor should be called only when the object is no
    longer needed. It's important to ensure that all auctions are properly finalized
    before destruction to prevent data inconsistencies. The destructor may perform
    database operations to persist auction state changes.
  warnings: Calling the destructor directly on an already destroyed object can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure proper object lifecycle management to avoid double-destruction
    issues.
