  method: GetProviderName
  signature: std::string LLMProvider::GetProviderName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the LLM provider instance.
  description: The GetProviderName method retrieves and returns the human-readable
    name associated with the current LLM provider. This name typically identifies
    the specific large language model or service being used, such as 'OpenAI', 'Anthropic',
    or 'LocalModel'. The returned string is immutable and represents a unique identifier
    for the provider within the system. This method is commonly used in logging, debugging,
    and UI display to indicate which LLM backend is currently active. No parameters
    are required, and the method performs no side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the name of the LLM provider. The string is guaranteed
    to be non-empty and valid for the lifetime of the LLMProvider instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LLMProvider* provider = GetActiveLLMProvider();

      std::string name = provider->GetProviderName();

      printf("Active LLM Provider: %s\n", name.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Provider Information
    code: "void LogCurrentLLMProvider() {\n    LLMProvider* provider = GetActiveLLMProvider();\n\
      \    if (provider) {\n        LOG_INFO(\"worldserver\", \"Using LLM provider:\
      \ {}\", provider->GetProviderName());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    string is cached internally to avoid repeated computation or lookups. It's recommended
    to cache the result if the provider name is accessed frequently.
