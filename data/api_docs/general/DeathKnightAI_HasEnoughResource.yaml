  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::HasEnoughResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Death Knight has sufficient resource requirements to cast a
    specified spell
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the Death Knight AI
    character possesses adequate resources (such as runes, energy, or other special
    abilities) required to cast a specific spell identified by its spell ID. This
    method is typically used during spell selection and execution logic to ensure
    that the AI does not attempt to cast spells without meeting their resource prerequisites.
    It integrates with the game's resource management system for Death Knights, which
    includes tracking rune states, runic power, and other class-specific mechanics.
    The method returns true if all necessary resources are available, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to entries in the spell database and determines which
      resources are needed for casting.
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight has sufficient resources to cast the specified
    spell, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that one or
    more required resources (e.g., runes, runic power) are currently unavailable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (ai->HasEnoughResource(49998)) // Death Strike\n{\n    ai->DoCast(49998);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting with Resource Check
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 0;\nif (ai->HasEnoughResource(49998)) // Death Strike\n\
      \    spellToCast = 49998;\nelif (ai->HasEnoughResource(50001)) // Blood Strike\n\
      \    spellToCast = 50001;\n\nif (spellToCast)\n    ai->DoCast(spellToCast);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal resource tracking within the DeathKnightAI
    class, including rune states and runic power levels. It should be called before
    attempting to cast any spell that requires specific resources to avoid invalid
    actions. The implementation may vary depending on the current state of the AI's
    resource pool.
  warnings: Do not assume that a successful return from this method guarantees immediate
    casting success; other factors such as line of sight, target conditions, or cooldowns
    might still prevent spell execution. Also, calling this method without proper
    context can lead to incorrect behavior if resource states change between checks
    and actual cast attempts.
