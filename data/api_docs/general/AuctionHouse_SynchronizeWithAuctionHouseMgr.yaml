  signature: void AuctionHouse::SynchronizeWithAuctionHouseMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes auction house data with the auction house manager to ensure
    consistency between in-memory and persistent states.
  description: The SynchronizeWithAuctionHouseMgr method ensures that all auction
    house data held in memory is synchronized with the auction house manager's internal
    state. This process typically involves updating any pending changes, committing
    transactions, or refreshing cached data to maintain data integrity across the
    auction system. It is commonly called during critical transitions such as server
    shutdowns, periodic maintenance, or when external modifications are detected.
    The method does not accept parameters and performs no direct return operations,
    but may trigger internal events or callbacks related to auction house state changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Synchronization Call
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionMgr->GetAuctionHouse();

      ah->SynchronizeWithAuctionHouseMgr();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked carefully during server maintenance or shutdown
    procedures to avoid data loss or inconsistency. It may block execution until synchronization
    is complete, depending on implementation details.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate contexts (e.g., during active
    player auctions) might lead to inconsistent auction states or unexpected behavior.
    Ensure that no active transactions are in progress before invoking it.
