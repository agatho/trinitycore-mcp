  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: IsTrainerForSkill
  signature: bool BotNpcLocationService::IsTrainerForSkill(uint32 creatureEntry, uint32
    skillId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature entry is a trainer for the specified skill.
  description: The IsTrainerForSkill method checks if a given NPC creature entry is
    configured as a trainer for a specific skill in the TrinityCore database. This
    method is typically used by bot AI systems to identify valid trainers for skill
    learning. It queries internal data structures or database tables that define which
    NPCs can train which skills, ensuring that bots do not attempt to train skills
    from invalid trainers. The method returns true if the creature is a valid trainer
    for the specified skill, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for proper bot behavior in World of Warcraft emulation environments where NPCs
    have specific training capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the NPC creature to check. This
      corresponds to the 'entry' field in the creature_template table in the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: skillId
    description: The skill ID to verify training capability for. This represents a
      specific skill defined in the game's skill system, typically matching entries
      in the skill_line or skill_line_ability tables.
  returns: Returns true if the specified creature entry is a trainer for the given
    skill ID; otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate that either
    the creature does not exist, is not configured as a trainer, or lacks training
    capability for the specified skill.
  examples:
  - title: Check if NPC is a trainer for Blacksmithing
    code: "if (BotNpcLocationService::IsTrainerForSkill(12345, SKILL_BLACKSMITHING))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with bot training logic\n    printf(\"NPC 12345 can train\
      \ Blacksmithing\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate trainer before attempting to learn skill
    code: "uint32 npcEntry = player->GetTarget()->GetEntry();\nuint32 skillId = SKILL_LEATHERWORKING;\n\
      \nif (BotNpcLocationService::IsTrainerForSkill(npcEntry, skillId)) {\n    //\
      \ Bot can attempt to learn the skill from this trainer\n    bot->LearnSkill(skillId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid trainer case\n    bot->Say(\"This NPC cannot\
      \ train that skill.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached or pre-loaded data from the database
    to improve performance. It may internally query creature_template or npc_trainer
    tables to determine trainer capabilities. The implementation should be thread-safe
    if used in multi-threaded bot environments.
  warnings: Ensure that both creatureEntry and skillId parameters are valid before
    calling this method, as invalid IDs could cause undefined behavior or database
    errors. This method is primarily intended for internal use by bot AI logic and
    may not reflect real-time changes to trainer configurations without cache refreshes.
