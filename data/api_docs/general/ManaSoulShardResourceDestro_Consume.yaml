  method: Consume
  signature: bool ManaSoulShardResourceDestro::Consume(uint32 manaCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes mana soul shards to reduce the resource count and return true if
    successful.
  description: The Consume method attempts to consume a specified amount of mana soul
    shards from the resource pool. It checks whether sufficient resources are available
    before deducting them. This method is typically used in spell or ability systems
    where mana soul shards are consumed as part of the casting cost. The operation
    returns true if the consumption was successful, and false if there were insufficient
    resources. This method does not directly affect player stats or game state beyond
    resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: manaCost
    description: The amount of mana soul shards to consume from the resource pool.
      Must be a positive integer representing the number of shards required for the
      action.
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of mana soul shards were successfully
    consumed, false otherwise. If insufficient resources exist, it will return false
    without modifying the resource count.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Consume method
    code: "if (manaSoulShardResource->Consume(5)) {\n    // Successfully consumed\
      \ 5 mana soul shards\n    // Proceed with spell or ability execution\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Not enough mana soul shards available\n    // Handle insufficient\
      \ resources case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Consume in a spell effect handler
    code: "void SpellEffect::HandleManaSoulShardConsumption(Unit* caster, uint32 shardCost)\
      \ {\n    if (manaSoulShardResource->Consume(shardCost)) {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with spell effect\n        caster->CastSpell(caster, SPELL_ID, true);\n  \
      \  } else {\n        // Send error message to player\n        SendCastFailedMessage(SPELL_ID,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NO_POWER);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the resource pool has been properly initialized
    and contains a valid count of mana soul shards. It is designed to be thread-safe
    in single-threaded environments but may require additional synchronization if
    used across multiple threads. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input parameter beyond ensuring it's a positive integer.
  warnings: Ensure that the manaCost parameter is validated before calling this method,
    as negative values or zero may lead to unexpected behavior. This method should
    not be called in scenarios where resource consumption might cause negative balances
    unless explicitly supported by the system design.
