documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GuildEventCoordinator class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the GuildEventCoordinator
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the coordinator exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global guild event
    handling functionality, such as managing guild member events, guild chat messages,
    and other guild-related activities within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    pointer should be used directly without attempting to delete or manage its lifetime,
    as it represents a globally managed singleton object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single, globally accessible GuildEventCoordinator instance.
    The method never returns NULL under normal operation, as the singleton is initialized
    during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing GuildEventCoordinator for Event Handling
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator* coordinator = GuildEventCoordinator::instance();

      // Use coordinator to handle guild events

      coordinator->HandleGuildChatMessage(player, "Hello guild!");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if GuildEventCoordinator is Available
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator* coord = GuildEventCoordinator::instance();\nif (coord)\n\
      {\n    // Safe to use the coordinator\n    coord->ProcessPendingEvents();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's designed for global access. The singleton
    instance is initialized during server startup and remains valid throughout the
    application lifecycle. Developers should not attempt to manually construct or
    destroy GuildEventCoordinator instances.
  warnings: Do not delete or manage the returned pointer's lifetime, as it's a singleton
    managed by the TrinityCore framework. Accessing this method before server initialization
    may result in undefined behavior if the singleton hasn't been constructed yet.
