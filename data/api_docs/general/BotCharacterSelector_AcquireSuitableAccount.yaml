  class: BotCharacterSelector

  signature: uint32 BotCharacterSelector::AcquireSuitableAccount(const int & request)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a suitable account ID for bot character assignment based
    on request criteria.
  description: The AcquireSuitableAccount method is responsible for selecting an appropriate
    account from the available accounts within the TrinityCore system to assign to
    a bot character. This method evaluates various factors such as account status,
    player count, and resource availability to determine the most suitable account
    for bot usage. It ensures that bots are distributed across accounts in a balanced
    manner to maintain server performance and prevent overloading any single account
    with too many bots. The method takes into consideration the request parameter
    which may contain specific criteria or constraints for account selection.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer parameter that specifies the criteria or requirements
      for selecting a suitable account. This value could represent different aspects
      such as bot type, difficulty level, or resource needs.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    selected account. If no suitable account is found, it may return 0 or throw an
    exception depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Account Acquisition
    code: "uint32 accountId = selector.AcquireSuitableAccount(1); // Request for basic\
      \ bot account\nif (accountId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with bot character creation\
      \ using the acquired account\n    std::cout << \"Acquired account ID: \" <<\
      \ accountId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Account Selection with Error Handling
    code: "int requestType = 3; // Advanced bot configuration request\nuint32 selectedAccount\
      \ = selector.AcquireSuitableAccount(requestType);\nif (selectedAccount == 0)\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where no suitable account was found\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to acquire suitable account for request type %d\", requestType);\n  \
      \  // Implement fallback or error recovery logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ selected account for bot creation\n    sLog->outString(\"Successfully acquired\
      \ account ID: %u\", selectedAccount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in bot management systems where multiple accounts
    are required to host various bot characters. The selection algorithm may consider
    factors like account level, number of existing bots, and server load balancing.
    Implementation details may vary depending on the specific TrinityCore version
    and bot system configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the request parameter is properly validated before passing
    it to this method, as invalid values might lead to unexpected behavior or failed
    account selection. Also, be aware that frequent calls to this method without proper
    throttling could impact server performance.
