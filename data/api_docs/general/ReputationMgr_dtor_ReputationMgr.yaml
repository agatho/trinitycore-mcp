documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ReputationMgr instance and cleans up associated reputation data.
  description: The ReputationMgr destructor is called when a ReputationMgr object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper cleanup of all reputation-related
    data structures, including faction standings, reputation gains, and any cached
    values. This method handles memory deallocation for internal containers storing
    player reputation information and prevents memory leaks during object destruction.
    The destructor does not perform any game logic operations but rather focuses on
    safe resource management.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ReputationMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ReputationMgr* repMgr = new ReputationMgr(player);\n\
      \    // ... use repMgr ...\n    delete repMgr; // Triggers ~ReputationMgr()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are deleted. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process
    ensures that all faction data is properly released and no dangling references
    remain.
