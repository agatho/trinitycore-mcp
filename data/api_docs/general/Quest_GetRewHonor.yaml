  brief: Returns the honor points reward for completing the quest
  description: The GetRewHonor method retrieves the amount of honor points that are
    awarded to the player upon completing the quest. This value represents the total
    honor gained from the quest's completion and is used in game mechanics to calculate
    player honor points. The method is part of the Quest class and provides access
    to the quest's honor reward data, which is essential for determining the player's
    progression in terms of honor points. This method does not require any parameters
    and returns a uint32 value representing the honor points.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the number of honor points awarded upon quest
    completion. It is a uint32 value that indicates how much honor the player will
    receive from completing this specific quest. This value can be zero if the quest
    does not award any honor points, or it may be a positive integer representing
    the actual honor reward.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 honorReward = quest->GetRewHonor();\nif (honorReward > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Player gets honor points\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    such as GetRewMoney or GetRewXP to determine the full reward of a quest. It should
    be noted that this method only returns the honor portion of the reward, not including
    any other rewards like experience points or money.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the quest might
    not have honor rewards; ensure proper checks are made to avoid unexpected behavior
    or errors when dealing with zero honor values.
