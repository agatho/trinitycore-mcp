documentation:
  brief: Publishes a quest event to all registered subscribers in the quest event
    bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a given QuestEvent to all registered
    listeners within the QuestEventBus. This mechanism allows various systems and
    scripts within TrinityCore to react to quest-related occurrences such as quest
    start, quest complete, or objective updates. The method returns true if the event
    was successfully published to at least one subscriber, or false if no subscribers
    were registered for the event type. This is a core component of the event-driven
    architecture used in World of Warcraft's quest system.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the event was successfully published to one or more subscribers;
    false if no subscribers were registered for this event type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Event Publication
    code: "QuestEvent event;\nevent.Type = QUEST_EVENT_TYPE_COMPLETE;\nevent.QuestId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool success = questEventBus.PublishEvent(event);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Event was published to at least one subscriber\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the core quest system. The event
    bus maintains a list of registered callbacks for different quest event types,
    and this method iterates through them to notify all interested parties. Performance
    is generally good as it's designed to be lightweight, but excessive use of events
    may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
