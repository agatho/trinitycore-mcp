api:
  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: RespondToBackupCall
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::RespondToBackupCall(int * player, const int & location)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground AI should respond to a backup call from
    a player.
  description: The RespondToBackupCall method evaluates if the battleground AI instance
    should accept and process a backup request made by a player. This typically occurs
    during battlegrounds when players need assistance or support from nearby AI-controlled
    units. The method checks various conditions such as the player's location, the
    AI's current state, and whether it is appropriate for the AI to provide backup.
    It returns true if the AI decides to respond to the call, otherwise false. This
    method plays a key role in dynamic battleground behavior and player support mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the battleground. This value is modified by the method to reflect the
      actual player being responded to.
  - name: location
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the location or zone ID where
      the backup call originated. Used to determine proximity and relevance of the
      AI's response.
  returns: Returns true if the AI decides to respond to the backup call, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the AI will attempt to assist the player
    at the specified location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI Context
    code: "int playerId = 42;\nint callLocation = 105;\nif (bgAI->RespondToBackupCall(&playerId,\
      \ callLocation)) {\n    // AI will provide backup support\n    // Handle the\
      \ response accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should be called only
    within appropriate battleground contexts. The player ID and location parameters
    must be valid identifiers for the current battleground instance to ensure correct
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before passing it into this
    method, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also, calling
    this method outside of a valid battleground context may result in incorrect or
    unexpected AI responses.
