  class: BotAction
  method: InteractNPC
  signature: BotAction BotAction::InteractNPC(int bot, int npc, uint32 timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates interaction with a specified NPC for a given bot at a specific
    timestamp.
  description: The InteractNPC method triggers an AI action that causes a bot to interact
    with a specified non-player character (NPC) within the game world. This action
    is typically used in automated bot behavior systems where bots need to perform
    interactions such as talking to NPCs, accepting quests, or purchasing items. The
    method requires both the bot identifier and the NPC identifier to determine which
    entities are involved in the interaction. The timestamp parameter allows for precise
    control over when this interaction should occur, enabling scheduling of actions
    within the bot's AI sequence. This method is part of the general bot action category,
    indicating it handles fundamental gameplay interactions rather than specialized
    or combat-related actions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the bot that will perform the NPC interaction.
      This ID corresponds to a specific bot instance within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: npc
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the non-player character (NPC) that
      the bot will interact with. This ID identifies a specific NPC in the game world.
  - name: timestamp
    description: A Unix timestamp indicating when the NPC interaction should take
      place. This allows for scheduling and timing of bot actions within the AI system.
  returns: Returns a BotAction object representing the scheduled NPC interaction action.
    This object can be used to track or modify the action within the bot's AI sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic NPC Interaction
    code: BotAction action = botAction.InteractNPC(12345, 67890, 1678886400);
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling Future Interaction
    code: 'uint32 futureTime = time(nullptr) + 300; // 5 minutes from now

      BotAction action = botAction.InteractNPC(12345, 67890, futureTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both the bot and NPC exist in the game world and
    are accessible to the AI system. The timestamp should be a valid Unix timestamp;
    using an invalid or past timestamp may result in immediate execution or unexpected
    behavior. Implementation details suggest this method likely queues the interaction
    for execution at the specified time, rather than executing immediately.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot ID and NPC ID are valid before calling this method
    to avoid runtime errors. Using a timestamp in the past may cause immediate execution
    which could interfere with other scheduled actions. This method does not validate
    whether the bot is within range of the NPC or if the interaction is otherwise
    possible in game mechanics.
