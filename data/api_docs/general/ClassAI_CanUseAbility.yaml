  class: ClassAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool ClassAI::CanUseAbility(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a class AI can use a specified spell ability.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a ClassAI instance is capable
    of utilizing a given spell ability based on various internal conditions such as
    cooldowns, resource requirements, and AI state. This method is typically used
    within the AI decision-making process to filter out invalid or unavailable abilities
    before attempting to cast them. It ensures that only appropriate spells are considered
    for execution by the AI, contributing to realistic and balanced gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell ability to check for usability.
      This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the AI can use the specified spell ability, otherwise false.
    The method returns false when the spell is on cooldown, lacks required resources
    (mana, rage, energy), or if the AI's current state prevents casting the spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (ai->CanUseAbility(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with casting the spell\n\
      \    ai->DoCastVictim(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Selection
    code: "std::vector<int> availableSpells = {12345, 67890, 54321};\nfor (int spellId\
      \ : availableSpells) {\n    if (ai->CanUseAbility(spellId)) {\n        ai->DoCastVictim(spellId);\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform the actual casting of the spell; it only checks
    eligibility. The AI implementation may internally cache results or use additional
    logic to determine spell availability. Developers should be aware that this check
    might involve complex state evaluation and could potentially impact performance
    if called frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell marked as usable by this method will always
    succeed when cast, as external factors like target conditions or combat state
    changes may still prevent execution. Avoid calling this method excessively during
    high-frequency AI updates to prevent unnecessary overhead.
