  class: PossessedAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void PossessedAI::AttackStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target for a possessed creature.
  description: The AttackStart method is used by the PossessedAI class to begin attacking
    a target entity. This method is typically invoked when a possessed creature (such
    as a player-controlled NPC) needs to engage in combat with another unit. It sets
    up the AI's attack state and begins the combat behavior sequence, including targeting
    the specified unit and initiating melee or ranged attacks depending on the creature's
    capabilities. The method handles the transition from idle or passive state to
    active combat mode.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that the possessed creature will attack.
      This parameter must point to a valid GameObject or Creature instance, otherwise
      undefined behavior may occur.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AttackStart with a creature target
    code: 'Creature* target = ...; // Get a reference to the target creature

      PossessedAI* ai = (PossessedAI*)creature->GetAI();

      ai->AttackStart((int*)target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AttackStart with player target in a possessed state
    code: 'Player* playerTarget = ...; // Get reference to player

      Creature* possessedCreature = ...; // Get the possessed creature

      PossessedAI* ai = (PossessedAI*)possessedCreature->GetAI();

      ai->AttackStart((int*)playerTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target is valid and in the same map as the possessed
    creature. The AI state transition occurs immediately upon calling this method,
    and it may interrupt any ongoing actions such as movement or casting. This method
    should only be called when the possessed creature is in a state where it can engage
    in combat.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null target pointer to AttackStart will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target is valid and exists before
    calling this method. Also, be aware that calling this method on creatures that
    are not actually possessed may lead to unexpected AI behavior.
