  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetOrientationFixed
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetOrientationFixed(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables fixed orientation for spline movement.
  description: The SetOrientationFixed method controls whether the object's orientation
    is fixed during spline-based movement. When enabled, the object maintains its
    current facing direction throughout the movement animation, regardless of the
    path's curvature. This is commonly used for creatures or NPCs that should not
    rotate while moving along a predefined path. The setting affects how the movement
    spline is calculated and rendered in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      fixed orientation for spline movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Fixed Orientation for NPC Movement
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetOrientationFixed(true);

      // Subsequent movement will maintain current facing direction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Fixed Orientation for Natural Rotation
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetOrientationFixed(false);

      // Movement will naturally rotate the object along the path'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a spline movement to ensure
    proper behavior. The fixed orientation setting is typically used for NPCs that
    should not turn while walking or running on a path.
