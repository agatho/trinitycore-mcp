documentation:
  brief: Returns the available space in the player's quest log
  description: The GetQuestLogSpace method retrieves the number of free slots currently
    available in the player's quest log. In World of Warcraft, players can only carry
    a limited number of active quests at any given time, typically 25 slots. This
    method allows scripts and systems to determine how many more quests can be added
    to the player's log before reaching capacity. The returned value represents the
    count of empty quest log slots that are available for new quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of free quest log slots available
    for new quests. Returns 0 if the quest log is full.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Quest Log Space
    code: "void CheckQuestLogSpace(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 space = player->GetQuestManager()->GetQuestLogSpace();\n\
      \    if (space > 0)\n    {\n        // Player can accept more quests\n     \
      \   ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"You have %u quest log\
      \ slots available.\", space);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Quest log\
      \ is full\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Your\
      \ quest log is full. Complete or abandon quests to make space.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly reflects the player's current quest log capacity and
    should be used in conjunction with quest acceptance logic to prevent exceeding
    the maximum allowed quests. The quest log size is fixed at 25 slots in most World
    of Warcraft versions, though this may vary depending on expansion or server configuration.
