  signature: Group * Battleground::GetBgRaid(int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the battleground raid group for the specified team.
  description: The GetBgRaid method retrieves the Group object associated with a specific
    team in the battleground. This method is used to access the raid group structure
    that manages players belonging to either the Alliance or Horde team within the
    context of a battleground instance. The returned Group object can be used to iterate
    through players, check group status, or perform operations on the team's roster.
    This method is typically called during battleground initialization, player assignment,
    or when managing team-based gameplay mechanics such as scoring or reward distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Group object representing the battleground raid for the
    specified team, or nullptr if no group exists for that team.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through Alliance raid members
    code: "Group* allianceRaid = bg->GetBgRaid(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\nif (allianceRaid)\n\
      {\n    for (GroupReference* ref = allianceRaid->GetFirstMember(); ref; ref =\
      \ ref->next())\n    {\n        Player* player = ref->getSource();\n        if\
      \ (player)\n        {\n            // Process each Alliance player in the battleground\n\
      \            sLog->outString(\"Alliance player: %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the battleground has been properly initialized with
    team groups. The returned Group pointer should not be modified directly as it's
    managed by the battleground system. The method is safe to call during active battleground
    operations, but accessing group members during player disconnections or wipes
    may result in invalid references.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned Group object will always contain players
    - groups can be empty or null if no players have been assigned to a team yet.
    Always check for nullptr before using the returned Group pointer to avoid segmentation
    faults.
