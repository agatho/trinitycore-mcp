  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: OnMovementStopped
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::OnMovementStopped()
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot's movement is stopped during AI processing.
  description: The OnMovementStopped method is invoked when a bot's movement has been
    interrupted or completed, allowing the AI to perform necessary cleanup or state
    transitions. This method is typically called by the core AI system when movement-related
    events occur, such as pathfinding completion, obstacle avoidance, or manual interruption
    of movement commands. It serves as a hook for custom bot behaviors that need to
    react to stopping conditions, including updating internal states, triggering actions,
    or preparing for new movement patterns.

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnMovementStopped()\n{\n    // Log that movement has stopped\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u has stopped moving.\", GetBot()->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Perform any necessary cleanup or state updates\n    m_isMoving = false;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI's event handling system and should
    not be called directly from external code. It is expected to be overridden in
    derived classes to implement custom behavior when movement stops. The method may
    be invoked multiple times during a single bot session depending on movement interruptions
    or completions.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy computations or blocking operations within this method
    as it may affect AI responsiveness. Avoid calling movement-related functions directly
    from this method to prevent potential recursion or state inconsistencies.
