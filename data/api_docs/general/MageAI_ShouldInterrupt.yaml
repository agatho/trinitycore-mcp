  class: MageAI
  method: ShouldInterrupt
  signature: bool MageAI::ShouldInterrupt(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Mage AI should interrupt the current spell cast by
    the target unit.
  description: The ShouldInterrupt method evaluates if the Mage AI should interrupt
    an ongoing spell cast by a target unit. This decision is typically based on factors
    such as the type of spell being cast, the threat level of the target, and the
    mage's current spell priority or strategy. The method is part of the Mage's AI
    behavior system and is used during combat to make tactical decisions about when
    to interrupt enemy casts, particularly for spells that could be harmful or disruptive
    to the mage or their group. This method may consider factors like spell school,
    cast time, damage type, and the mage's current mana or spell availability.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell cast
      is being evaluated for interruption. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the Mage AI should interrupt the target's current spell
    cast, false otherwise. The decision is based on combat logic and spell prioritization
    rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (mageAI->ShouldInterrupt(targetUnit)) {\n    mageAI->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat logic
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->GetVictim() && ShouldInterrupt(me->GetVictim()))\
      \ {\n        DoCast(SPELL_POLYMORPH);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may be influenced
    by spell cooldowns, mana availability, and the mage's current combat stance. The
    decision-making process involves evaluating the threat level of the target's spell
    and comparing it against the mage's own tactical priorities.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to prevent null pointer dereferences. The interrupt logic may conflict with other
    AI behaviors if not properly coordinated.
