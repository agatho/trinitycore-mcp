  method: GetPureMaxSkillValue
  signature: uint16 Player::GetPureMaxSkillValue(uint32 skill) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum skill value for a specified skill without any modifiers
    or bonuses applied.
  description: This method retrieves the base maximum skill value for a given skill,
    excluding any temporary bonuses, buffs, or gear modifications that might affect
    the final skill cap. It represents the pure, unmodified skill level that a player
    would have before any additional factors are considered. The method is particularly
    useful for determining baseline skill values in game mechanics calculations where
    specific skill modifications need to be accounted for separately.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the maximum skill value for the specified
    skill, which corresponds to the base skill cap before any modifiers are applied.
    This value typically ranges from 0 to 32767, with 0 indicating no skill or invalid
    skill.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint16 maxSkill = player->GetPureMaxSkillValue(129); // Get the pure maximum
      skill value for Alchemy

      std::cout << "Max Skill: " << maxSkill << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    to calculate final skill values. It should be noted that the returned value represents
    only the base skill cap and does not include any temporary bonuses or modifiers
    from items, spells, or buffs.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with other skill calculation
    methods, as it may lead to incorrect results if used without considering all relevant
    modifiers. This method should be used carefully in scenarios where skill modifications
    are involved.
