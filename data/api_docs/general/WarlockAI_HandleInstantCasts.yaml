  signature: bool WarlockAI::HandleInstantCasts(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the warlock can immediately cast a spell on the target.
  description: The HandleInstantCasts method evaluates if the WarlockAI instance is
    capable of casting an instant spell against the specified target. This method
    typically checks for valid target conditions, spell availability, mana requirements,
    and other combat-related constraints that would prevent an immediate spell cast.
    It serves as a decision-making function within the AI's spell selection logic,
    ensuring that only viable instant casts are attempted during combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the warlock can immediately cast a spell on the target;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (warlockAI->HandleInstantCasts(target)) {\n    // Proceed with casting\
      \ an instant spell\n    warlockAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_IMMOLATE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarlockAI's core combat logic and should be called
    before attempting to cast any instant spells. It may internally check for cooldowns,
    line-of-sight, target validity, and resource availability.
