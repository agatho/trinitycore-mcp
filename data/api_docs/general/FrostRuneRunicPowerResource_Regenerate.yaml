documentation:
  brief: Regenerates frost rune runic power resource over time based on elapsed game
    ticks.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for incrementally restoring the
    frost rune's runic power resource. This typically occurs during combat or passive
    regeneration periods, where the resource gradually increases until it reaches
    its maximum value. The method takes a time delta (diff) parameter that represents
    the number of milliseconds elapsed since the last update, and uses this to determine
    how much resource should be regenerated. It is commonly invoked by the game's
    core update loop to maintain dynamic resource states for player characters using
    frost runes.

  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'FrostRuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      resource.Regenerate(1000); // Regenerate over 1 second'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal cooldown tracking and resource
    limits. It may be called from the main game loop or through event-driven systems
    such as combat updates.
