  description: This method handles the activation of garrison buildings through spell
    effects, typically used in conjunction with garrison building spells. It processes
    the building activation logic and updates the garrison state accordingly. The
    method is part of the broader garrison system implementation and may involve various
    game mechanics related to building construction, upgrades, and resource management.

  notes: Implementation details include handling of building state updates and potential
    resource consumption. Performance considerations involve checking for valid building
    states before activation. Thread safety is ensured through proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the spell's target is a valid garrison
    building. Improper usage may lead to invalid state updates or crashes.
