  class: InteractionManager
  method: SellItem
  signature: bool InteractionManager::SellItem(Player * bot, Creature * vendor, Item
    * item, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Sells an item from a bot's inventory to a vendor creature.
  description: The SellItem method facilitates the selling of a specified item from
    a player bot's inventory to a vendor creature within the World of Warcraft game
    environment. It handles the transaction logic, including updating the bot's inventory,
    modifying the vendor's stock, and transferring gold to the bot's account. The
    method ensures that the item being sold is valid, the vendor accepts that item
    type, and sufficient quantity exists in the bot's inventory. This function is
    typically used by AI systems or automated scripts to manage a bot's economy and
    resource management during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to sell
      the item. Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor to whom the
      item is being sold. Must be a valid vendor creature with sellable inventory.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object that the bot wishes to sell. Must be a
      valid item in the bot's inventory and acceptable by the vendor.
  - name: count
    description: Number of items to sell from the stack. Must be a positive integer
      not exceeding the quantity available in the bot's inventory for the specified
      item.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully sold, false otherwise. Failure
    can occur due to invalid parameters, insufficient item quantity, vendor rejection,
    or transaction errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Selling
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; Creature* vendor = ...; Item* item = ...;

      bool success = bot->GetSession()->GetInteractionManager()->SellItem(bot, vendor,
      item, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Selling Multiple Items
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; Creature* vendor = ...; Item* item = ...;

      uint32 count = 5;

      bool success = bot->GetSession()->GetInteractionManager()->SellItem(bot, vendor,
      item, count);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore transaction system and may
    involve database updates. It should only be called when both the bot and vendor
    are in valid states (e.g., not in combat or dead). The method does not perform
    any checks for item durability or quality, assuming these are handled by the calling
    code.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid pointers or zero count may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the bot has sufficient permissions and that the vendor accepts
    the specified item type before invoking this function. Do not call this from within
    a combat state as it might cause synchronization issues.
