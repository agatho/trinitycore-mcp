  signature: void GossipHandler::LoadKnownPaths()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all known gossip paths for NPC interactions within
    the game world.
  description: The LoadKnownPaths method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all predefined gossip paths that define how NPCs interact with players through
    dialogue options. This method typically runs during server startup or when a new
    map is loaded, ensuring that all available gossip interactions are properly registered
    in memory. It handles the retrieval of gossip data from database tables such as
    `gossip_menu` and related entries, and prepares them for use in player-NPC conversations.
    The method does not accept any parameters and performs no direct return operations;
    instead, it modifies internal state to make gossip menus available for runtime
    interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeGossip()\n{\n    sGossipHandler->LoadKnownPaths();\n\
      }\n\n// Called during server startup to prepare all gossip paths"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked once at server boot time or when loading a
    new map. It relies on database entries being correctly populated with gossip menu
    data and associated options. Performance considerations may arise if there are
    thousands of gossip entries, as each must be parsed and cached in memory.
  warnings: Improperly configured gossip entries in the database can cause crashes
    or missing dialogue options during runtime. Ensure that all referenced IDs in
    gossip tables exist to prevent invalid memory access.
