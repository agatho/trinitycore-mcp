  class: Corpse
  method: SetCellCoord
  signature: void Corpse::SetCellCoord(const int & cellCoord)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cell coordinate for this corpse object, updating its spatial positioning
    within the game world.
  description: The SetCellCoord method assigns a specific cell coordinate to a Corpse
    object, which is used internally by TrinityCore's grid-based spatial management
    system. This method updates the corpse's location data to reflect its position
    within a particular grid cell, enabling proper handling of corpse visibility,
    respawn mechanics, and spatial queries. The cell coordinate typically represents
    the grid cell in which the corpse resides, allowing the server to efficiently
    manage and update corpse states based on player movement and zone transitions.
    This method is generally called during corpse creation or when a corpse's position
    needs to be recalculated due to environmental changes.
  parameters:
  - name: cellCoord
    description: The integer value representing the grid cell coordinate where this
      corpse is located. This value corresponds to the spatial grid system used by
      TrinityCore, typically ranging from negative to positive values based on world
      coordinates mapped to grid cells.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Corpse's Cell Coordinate
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      corpse->SetCellCoord(15); // Sets the corpse to cell coordinate 15'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Corpse Position After Respawn
    code: "if (player->GetCorpse())\n{\n    player->GetCorpse()->SetCellCoord(player->GetGridX());\
      \ // Update corpse cell based on player's current grid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal spatial data structures. It should
    only be called when the corpse's actual position in the world has changed, not
    merely for display purposes. The method does not validate whether the provided
    cell coordinate is within valid bounds; it simply assigns the value as given.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or inappropriate cell coordinate may
    cause issues with corpse visibility and spatial queries. Ensure that the cell
    coordinate corresponds to a valid grid cell in the current map before calling
    this method.
