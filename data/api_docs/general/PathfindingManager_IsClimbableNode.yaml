  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsClimbableNode
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsClimbableNode(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified node in the pathfinding grid is climbable,
    allowing units to traverse vertical obstacles.
  description: The IsClimbableNode method checks if a given node within the pathfinding
    system's grid is marked as climbable. This functionality is essential for determining
    whether creatures or players can navigate vertically traversable terrain such
    as cliffs, ledges, or other elevated structures without requiring a flight path
    or special movement ability. The method evaluates the node's properties against
    predefined criteria that define climbability in the game world. It typically operates
    on internal pathfinding data structures and returns a boolean result indicating
    whether climbing is permitted at that specific location.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer representing the position identifier or index of the node
      within the pathfinding grid. This value usually corresponds to a unique node
      in the navigation mesh, often derived from coordinates or grid cell indices.
  returns: Returns true if the specified node is marked as climbable and allows vertical
    traversal; otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates
    that movement through this node would be blocked by an obstacle or terrain feature
    that cannot be climbed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check climbability of a node
    code: "int nodeIndex = 1234;\nif (pathfindingManager->IsClimbableNode(nodeIndex))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with climbing logic\n    printf(\"Node %d is climbable\\\
      n\", nodeIndex);\n} else {\n    // Handle non-climbable terrain\n    printf(\"\
      Node %d is not climbable\\n\", nodeIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsClimbableNode in pathfinding decision making
    code: "class AIHandler {\npublic:\n    bool CanMoveToPosition(int position) {\n\
      \        if (pathfindingManager->IsClimbableNode(position)) {\n            return\
      \ true; // Allow movement\n        }\n        return false; // Prevent movement\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal pathfinding data structures such
    as the NavMesh or grid-based navigation system. It may be used in conjunction
    with other pathfinding methods to determine valid movement paths for NPCs or players.
    The node position parameter should correspond to a valid index within the current
    pathfinding context.
  warnings: Ensure that the input 'pos' parameter refers to a valid node within the
    active pathfinding grid, as invalid indices may lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect results. This method does not validate node boundaries or existence
    in isolation.
