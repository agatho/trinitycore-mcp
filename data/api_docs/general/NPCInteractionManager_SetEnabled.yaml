  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables NPC interaction functionality within the manager.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether NPC interactions are active
    or inactive in the NPCInteractionManager. When enabled, the manager will process
    and handle NPC interaction events such as gossip options, quest interactions,
    and dialogue triggers. When disabled, these interactions are ignored, effectively
    disabling all NPC-related player interactions. This method is typically used to
    temporarily disable NPC interactions during specific game events, combat scenarios,
    or when transitioning between different game states. The state change is immediate
    and affects all subsequent NPC interaction attempts.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether NPC interactions should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable NPC Interactions
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      manager->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable NPC Interactions During Combat
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      // Disable during combat

      manager->SetEnabled(false);

      // ... combat logic ...

      // Re-enable after combat

      manager->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state flag of the NPCInteractionManager.
    It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with proper game state management
    to ensure consistent behavior during transitions between different gameplay modes.
  warnings: Calling SetEnabled(false) will immediately prevent any ongoing NPC interactions
    from proceeding, potentially interrupting player experiences. Ensure that disabling
    NPC interactions aligns with the intended game flow and does not negatively impact
    user experience.
