  brief: Plays a sound effect to all players within the battlefield area.
  description: The DoPlaySoundToAll method broadcasts a specified sound ID to all
    players currently present in the battlefield. This function is typically used
    to trigger audio cues for events such as capture point captures, battle start/end
    announcements, or other significant gameplay moments. The sound is played synchronously
    across all connected clients within the battlefield's scope. This method does
    not require any specific preconditions beyond the battlefield being active and
    players being present.
  parameters:
  - name: SoundID
    description: The unique identifier of the sound to be played. This ID corresponds
      to entries in the game's sound database and must reference a valid sound file
      that is accessible to the client.

  - title: Announce Battle Start
    code: battlefield->DoPlaySoundToAll(12345); // Triggers a battle start announcement
      sound to all players

  notes: This method operates on the battlefield's current player list and will only
    affect players who are actively participating in the battlefield. It is not intended
    for use outside of active battlefield contexts. The sound ID must be valid and
