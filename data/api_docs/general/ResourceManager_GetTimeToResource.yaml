  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetTimeToResource
  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::GetTimeToResource(ResourceType type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the time in milliseconds required to generate the specified amount
    of resource based on current resource regeneration rate.
  description: The GetTimeToResource method computes how long it will take for a player
    or unit to accumulate a given amount of a specific resource type (such as mana,
    rage, energy, or focus) from their current value, taking into account the active
    regeneration rate. This method is commonly used in game logic to determine when
    a resource will be fully replenished, particularly for abilities that require
    specific resource amounts. The calculation considers the current resource amount
    and the rate at which it regenerates, returning the time in milliseconds needed
    to reach the target amount. If the target amount is already met or exceeded, the
    method returns 0. This function is essential for UI elements, cooldown calculations,
    and ability usage validation within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value indicating which resource type to calculate
      time for (e.g., RESOURCE_MANA, RESOURCE_RAGE, RESOURCE_ENERGY, RESOURCE_FOCUS).
  - name: amount
    description: The target amount of the specified resource type that needs to be
      accumulated. Must be a non-negative integer.
  returns: Returns the time in milliseconds required to accumulate the specified amount
    of resource from the current value, or 0 if the amount is already met or exceeded.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate mana regeneration time
    code: uint32 manaTime = resourceManager->GetTimeToResource(RESOURCE_MANA, 500);
      // Calculates time to get 500 mana points
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if energy will be full soon
    code: "uint32 energyTime = resourceManager->GetTimeToResource(RESOURCE_ENERGY,\
      \ 100); // Time to fully regenerate energy\nif (energyTime <= 5000) // Less\
      \ than 5 seconds\n{\n    // Trigger UI notification or ability activation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that resource regeneration is continuous and linear.
    It does not account for temporary modifiers, buffs, or debuffs that might affect
    regeneration rates. The implementation may vary depending on the specific unit
    type (player vs NPC) and their current state. For performance-critical code paths,
    caching results or using precomputed values may be beneficial.
  warnings: The method returns 0 if the requested amount is already met or exceeded,
    which can lead to unexpected behavior in conditional logic if not properly handled.
    Ensure that resource types are valid enum values; invalid values may result in
    undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
