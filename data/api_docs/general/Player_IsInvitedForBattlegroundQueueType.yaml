  method: IsInvitedForBattlegroundQueueType
  signature: bool Player::IsInvitedForBattlegroundQueueType(int bgQueueTypeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is invited for a specific battleground queue type.
  description: This method determines whether the player has been invited to join
    a specific battleground queue type, such as Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin. It
    is commonly used in battleground queue management systems to verify invitation
    status before allowing players to enter battlegrounds. The method returns true
    if the player is currently invited for the specified queue type, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper queue synchronization and
    preventing players from entering battlegrounds without proper invitations.
  parameters:
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: The battleground queue type identifier that the player might be invited
      for. Valid values include 0 (for Warsong Gulch), 1 (for Arathi Basin), and 2
      (for Eye of the Storm). This parameter corresponds to specific battleground
      types defined in the game's queue system.
  returns: Returns true if the player is invited for the specified battleground queue
    type, false otherwise. The method does not return null values as it is a boolean
    function.
  examples:
  - title: Check Invitation Status
    code: "if (player->IsInvitedForBattlegroundQueueType(0))\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ invited for Warsong Gulch\n    // Proceed with queue entry logic\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Player is not invited\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other queue-related methods
    to manage player invitations and battleground entry. It should be called within
    the context of a player's queue status checks, and may involve synchronization
    with server-side queue systems.
  warnings: This method does not check if the player has already entered the battleground;
    it only verifies invitation status. Players might still be able to enter battlegrounds
    without being invited if they are in the correct queue state.
