documentation:
  brief: Loads all active complaint tickets from the database into memory for processing.
  description: The LoadComplaintTickets method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the SupportMgr class with all currently active complaint tickets
    stored in the TrinityCore database. This method is typically invoked during server
    startup or when the support system needs to refresh its ticket cache. It retrieves
    ticket data including ticket ID, player GUID, timestamp, and complaint details,
    then organizes them for efficient access and processing by other support-related
    functions. The method ensures that all pending tickets are available for staff
    review without requiring repeated database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSupportSystem()\n{\n    sSupportMgr->LoadComplaintTickets();\n\
      \    // Tickets are now loaded and ready for processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query to fetch all active tickets, which
    may cause a temporary performance impact during server startup. The loaded tickets
    are stored in memory and remain accessible until explicitly cleared or the manager
    is destroyed. This method should only be called once per server session to avoid
    duplicate ticket entries.
