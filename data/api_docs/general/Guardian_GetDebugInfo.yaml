  class: Guardian
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Guardian::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the guardian object including its type, owner,
    and current state.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides a comprehensive string representation
    of a Guardian object's internal state for debugging purposes. This includes details
    such as the guardian's type (e.g., pet, guardian), its owner's GUID, current health
    and mana values, and other relevant runtime information. The method is primarily
    used by developers and administrators to diagnose issues with guardians in the
    game world, particularly when investigating behavior anomalies or performance
    problems. It does not modify any internal state of the object and can be called
    safely during normal gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the guardian
    including its type, owner GUID, health, mana, and other relevant properties. The
    string is formatted in a human-readable way for logging or debugging purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: "Guardian* guardian = player->GetGuardian();\nif (guardian)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ debugInfo = guardian->GetDebugInfo();\n    sLog->outString(\"Guardian Debug\
      \ Info: %s\", debugInfo.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Debug Info for Logging
    code: "void LogGuardianState(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Unit* guardian = player->GetGuardian())\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outString(\"[Guardian State] %s\", guardian->GetDebugInfo().c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for debugging and development purposes only. The
    format of the returned string may change between different TrinityCore versions.
    The method performs no game logic operations and is safe to call from any thread
    context where the guardian object is accessible.
  warnings: The debug information returned by this method should not be used for gameplay
    logic or decision making, as it's designed purely for diagnostic purposes. Calling
    this method on a null guardian pointer will result in undefined behavior if not
    properly checked first.
