  class: Garrison
  method: GetPlot
  signature: const Plot * Garrison::GetPlot(uint32 garrPlotInstanceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific plot from the garrison using its instance ID.
  description: The GetPlot method retrieves a const pointer to a Plot object within
    the Garrison class based on the provided garrPlotInstanceId parameter. This method
    allows access to detailed information about a particular plot, such as its type,
    state, and associated buildings or upgrades. The returned Plot object is read-only,
    ensuring data integrity while allowing inspection of the garrison's layout. It's
    commonly used in garrison management systems to fetch specific plot details for
    UI updates, building placement validation, or quest progression checks.
  parameters:
  - name: garrPlotInstanceId
    description: The unique instance identifier for the plot within the garrison.
      This value corresponds to the Plot's internal ID used to distinguish different
      plots in the garrison's layout.
  returns: A const pointer to the Plot object if a valid plot with the specified instance
    ID exists; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching plot is found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Plot
    code: "const Plot* plot = garrison->GetPlot(12345);\nif (plot != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Use plot data\n    uint32 plotType = plot->GetType();\n    // Process\
      \ plot information\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid plot ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through Plots
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < MAX_PLOTS; ++i) {\n    const Plot* plot = garrison->GetPlot(i);\n\
      \    if (plot != nullptr) {\n        // Process valid plot\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Plot ID: \" << plot->GetId() << std::endl;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation using the provided instance ID, which
    may involve internal data structure traversal. For optimal performance in tight
    loops, consider caching results or pre-fetching plot data where possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the garrPlotInstanceId parameter is valid and corresponds
    to an existing plot within the garrison; otherwise, the method will return nullptr
    without error. Always check for null before dereferencing the returned pointer.
