  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetInsideUnits
  signature: const int & AreaTrigger::GetInsideUnits() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of units currently inside the area trigger.
  description: The GetInsideUnits method retrieves the number of game objects (typically
    players or creatures) that are currently within the boundaries of this area trigger.
    This is a read-only accessor that provides real-time information about the trigger's
    occupancy. The returned value represents the total count of entities currently
    inside the trigger's active area, which can be used for various game mechanics
    such as quest progression, combat triggers, or event activation. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the number of units currently
    inside the area trigger. The value will be zero if no units are present, and will
    increase as units enter the trigger's area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nint unitCount = trigger->GetInsideUnits();\n\
      if (unitCount > 0)\n{\n    // Trigger is currently active with units inside\n\
      \    // Perform actions based on the number of units\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Player Presence
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nconst int& count = trigger->GetInsideUnits();\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Notify players or activate events\n    // Example:\
      \ trigger->ActivateForPlayers();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an internal counter, so it's efficient
    and does not involve copying data. The count is automatically updated by the core
    engine as units enter or leave the area trigger's boundaries.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value is only valid at the time of the call
    and may change immediately after due to concurrent gameplay events. If you need
    to maintain a consistent reference to the number of units, consider caching the
    result in your own variable.
