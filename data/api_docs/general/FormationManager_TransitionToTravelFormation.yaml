documentation:
  brief: Transitions all units in the formation to a travel formation state.
  description: The TransitionToTravelFormation method changes the current formation
    state of all units managed by this FormationManager to a travel formation. This
    typically adjusts unit positioning, movement behavior, and group coordination
    to enable efficient travel across the game world. The method is commonly used
    when a group of units needs to move together in a structured manner, such as during
    questing or instance traversal. It ensures that all units maintain proper spacing
    and follow established formation rules while traveling.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = player->GetFormationManager();

      manager->TransitionToTravelFormation();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal state updates and should be called when
    the formation is ready to begin moving. It does not directly control movement;
    instead, it prepares units for travel by adjusting their formation behavior.
