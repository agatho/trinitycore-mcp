  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: EnablePredictiveTracking
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::EnablePredictiveTracking(Player * bot, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables predictive tracking for the specified player's objectives.
  description: The EnablePredictiveTracking method controls whether a player's objective
    tracker will display predicted progress or only current progress. When enabled,
    the tracker may show anticipated completion times or progress based on current
    activity. This feature is typically used in botting or automation scenarios where
    players want to anticipate objective completion. The method modifies internal
    tracking state for the specified player without affecting other players or game
    mechanics outside of the objective system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which predictive tracking should
      be enabled or disabled. Must not be null.
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      predictive tracking for the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable predictive tracking for a bot player
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer

      ObjectiveTracker::EnablePredictiveTracking(myBot, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable predictive tracking for a player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid Player pointer

      ObjectiveTracker::EnablePredictiveTracking(targetPlayer, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags within the ObjectiveTracker class.
    It may be used primarily in AI-controlled bots or automation scripts to provide
    more accurate progress estimation. The effect is localized to the specific player
    object passed as parameter.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. This method should not
    be called during critical game state transitions where objective tracking might
    be actively updating.
