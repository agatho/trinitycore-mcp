  class: CriteriaTreeEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int CriteriaTreeEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with this criteria tree entry for conditional
    evaluation and behavior control.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags configured for this CriteriaTreeEntry. These flags typically define how
    the criteria tree should be evaluated, whether it's active, required, or has specific
    behavioral attributes within the World of Warcraft achievement and quest systems.
    The returned value is a bitmask that can be checked against predefined flag constants
    to determine specific properties of the criteria tree. This method is commonly
    used during achievement processing, quest validation, and conditional logic evaluation
    in TrinityCore's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined bitwise flags for this criteria tree
    entry. Each bit corresponds to a specific attribute or behavior (e.g., active
    state, required flag, etc.). The value should be checked against predefined constants
    using bitwise operations to determine individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if Criteria Tree is Active
    code: "CriteriaTreeEntry* entry = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteriaTree(12345);\nif (entry\
      \ && (entry->GetFlags() & CRITERIA_FLAG_ACTIVE))\n{\n    // This criteria tree\
      \ is currently active\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluating Multiple Criteria Flags
    code: "CriteriaTreeEntry* entry = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteriaTree(12345);\nint flags\
      \ = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & CRITERIA_FLAG_REQUIRED)\n{\n    // This\
      \ criteria is required for completion\n}\nif (flags & CRITERIA_FLAG_HIDDEN)\n\
      {\n    // This criteria should be hidden from UI\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined as constants in the
    TrinityCore codebase, such as CRITERIA_FLAG_ACTIVE, CRITERIA_FLAG_REQUIRED, or
    CRITERIA_FLAG_HIDDEN. Developers should use bitwise operations to test individual
    flag states rather than direct equality comparisons. The method is thread-safe
    and can be called from any context where a CriteriaTreeEntry instance is available.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned integer value directly as it represents a cached
    bitmask. If flag modifications are needed, use the appropriate setter methods
    or internal APIs. Incorrect bitwise operations may lead to unexpected behavior
    in achievement or quest completion logic.
