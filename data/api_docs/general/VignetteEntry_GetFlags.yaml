  class: VignetteEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int VignetteEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a vignette entry, determining its
    behavior and visibility properties.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the combined
    flags of a VignetteEntry. These flags define various properties and behaviors
    of the vignette, such as whether it is visible, interactive, or has special activation
    conditions. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, vignettes are visual
    markers or objectives that appear in the game world, often related to quest markers,
    treasures, or special events. The returned integer value is typically a bitmask
    where each bit represents a specific flag. Developers can use bitwise operations
    to check for individual flag states. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call multiple times.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flags of the vignette entry. Each
    bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior of the vignette,
    such as visibility, interactivity, or activation status. The exact meaning of
    each flag depends on the game's internal definitions and can be checked using
    bitwise operations.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a vignette is visible
    code: "VignetteEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetVignetteEntry(12345);\nif (entry\
      \ && (entry->GetFlags() & VIGNETTE_FLAG_VISIBLE)) {\n    // The vignette is\
      \ visible\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combine multiple flag checks
    code: "VignetteEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetVignetteEntry(12345);\nint flags\
      \ = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & VIGNETTE_FLAG_INTERACTIVE && flags & VIGNETTE_FLAG_VISIBLE)\
      \ {\n    // The vignette is both visible and interactive\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned integer is a bitmask, so individual flag values should be checked
    using bitwise AND operations. Flag definitions (like VIGNETTE_FLAG_VISIBLE or
    VIGNETTE_FLAG_INTERACTIVE) are typically defined in the game's internal headers
    or documentation and may vary between different versions of TrinityCore or custom
    modifications.
