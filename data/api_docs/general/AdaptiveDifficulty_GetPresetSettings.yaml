documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the difficulty settings for a specified preset.
  description: The GetPresetSettings method fetches the predefined difficulty settings
    associated with a given DifficultyPreset enumeration value. This function is used
    to retrieve configuration data that defines how difficulty scaling, loot distribution,
    and other game mechanics behave for specific difficulty levels in World of Warcraft
    content. The returned DifficultySettings object contains various parameters such
    as health multipliers, damage modifiers, and spawn rates tailored for the requested
    preset. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a lookup
    operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DifficultySettings object containing all relevant configuration values
    for the specified difficulty preset. Returns an empty or default-initialized structure
    if the preset is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve settings for normal difficulty
    code: "DifficultySettings settings = difficultySystem.GetPresetSettings(DifficultyPreset::NORMAL);\n\
      if (settings.IsValid()) {\n    // Use settings for custom logic\n    float healthMod\
      \ = settings.GetHealthMultiplier();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if a preset has valid settings
    code: "auto settings = difficultySystem.GetPresetSettings(DifficultyPreset::HEROIC);\n\
      if (settings.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed with applying or using these\
      \ settings\n    LOG_INFO(\"Loaded settings for heroic mode\");\n} else {\n \
      \   LOG_ERROR(\"Failed to load settings for heroic mode\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during zone initialization or when difficulty
    changes are applied. It's thread-safe as it only reads from constant data structures
    and does not perform any locking operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the DifficultyPreset enum value passed to this function is
    valid; invalid values may result in undefined behavior or default settings being
    returned.
