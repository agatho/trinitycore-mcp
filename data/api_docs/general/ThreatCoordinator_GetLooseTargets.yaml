  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GetLooseTargets
  signature: int ThreatCoordinator::GetLooseTargets() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of loose targets in the threat coordinator's target list.
  description: The GetLooseTargets method retrieves the count of loose targets currently
    managed by the ThreatCoordinator. In the context of World of Warcraft's AI system,
    loose targets refer to units that are not directly engaged in combat but are still
    considered for threat calculation and targeting decisions. This method is typically
    used by AI scripts or threat management systems to determine how many non-combatant
    targets are present in the current threat state. The value returned can influence
    decision-making processes such as whether to switch targets, initiate new attacks,
    or maintain current focus.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of loose targets currently tracked by
    the ThreatCoordinator. A return value of zero indicates no loose targets are present,
    while a positive integer indicates the count of targets that are not actively
    engaged in combat but are still considered for threat calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int looseTargets = threatCoordinator.GetLooseTargets();\nif (looseTargets\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process loose targets\n    printf(\"Found %d loose targets\\\
      n\", looseTargets);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Target Management Decision
    code: "int looseTargets = threatCoordinator.GetLooseTargets();\nint engagedTargets\
      \ = threatCoordinator.GetEngagedTargets();\n\nif (looseTargets > 0 && engagedTargets\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // No engaged targets, consider targeting a loose one\n    threatCoordinator.SelectNewTarget();\n\
      }\nelse if (looseTargets == 0 && engagedTargets > 0)\n{\n    // Continue focusing\
      \ on engaged targets\n    threatCoordinator.ContinueCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other threat management
    functions to maintain proper combat state. The implementation likely involves
    iterating through internal target lists and counting those that meet the criteria
    for 'loose' status, which generally means they are not currently in combat with
    the creature but are still within threat range or influence.
  warnings: Be aware that the count returned by this method may change between calls
    if targets are added or removed from the threat coordinator's internal tracking
    system. This method should not be used as a definitive indicator of target status
    without considering concurrent modifications to the threat state.
