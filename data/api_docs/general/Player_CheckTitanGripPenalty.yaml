documentation:
  brief: Checks and applies TitanGrip penalty mechanics for the player.
  description: This method evaluates the player's current state to determine if TitanGrip
    penalties should be applied. It typically checks whether the player has an active
    TitanGrip effect or is in a state where such penalties would be relevant. The
    method ensures that proper game mechanics are enforced for TitanGrip-related behaviors,
    including handling of cooldowns and effects that prevent certain actions during
    TitanGrip states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: player->CheckTitanGripPenalty();
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking whether the player is currently under
    TitanGrip effects, and applying necessary penalties to prevent actions like casting
    spells or using abilities during the penalty period. Performance considerations
    may arise from frequent checks during combat.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's typically
    invoked by internal game systems when appropriate. Misuse could lead to incorrect
    behavior or unintended cooldowns.
