  signature: void GuildBankManager::UpdateMemberBankProfile(uint32 playerGuid, BankOperation
    operation, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a guild member's bank profile based on a specified operation and
    item.
  description: The UpdateMemberBankProfile method modifies a guild member's bank-related
    data in response to a specific operation involving an item. This method is typically
    invoked when a player interacts with the guild bank, such as withdrawing or depositing
    items. It ensures that the member's personal bank tab usage statistics and item
    tracking are updated accordingly within the guild bank system. The operation parameter
    defines whether the action is a deposit, withdrawal, or other bank-related activity,
    while the item ID identifies which item is being processed.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose bank profile will
      be updated. This value must correspond to an active guild member.
  - name: operation
    description: Specifies the type of bank operation being performed. Valid values
      typically include deposit, withdrawal, or other transaction types defined by
      the BankOperation enum.
  - name: itemId
    description: The identifier of the item involved in the operation. This value
      is used to track which item was deposited or withdrawn from the guild bank.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a member's profile after withdrawing an item
    code: GuildBankManager::UpdateMemberBankProfile(12345, BankOperation::WITHDRAW,
      45678);
    language: cpp
  - title: Update a member's profile after depositing an item
    code: GuildBankManager::UpdateMemberBankProfile(playerGuid, BankOperation::DEPOSIT,
      itemId);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank data structures and
    may trigger updates to the player's bank tab usage logs. It is assumed that this
    function is called internally by the core game logic upon successful bank transactions.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid corresponds to an actual guild member, otherwise
    the operation may fail silently or cause inconsistencies in the bank records.
    The operation parameter must be a valid BankOperation type; invalid values could
    lead to undefined behavior.
