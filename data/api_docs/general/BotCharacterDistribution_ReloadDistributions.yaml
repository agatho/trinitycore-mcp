  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: ReloadDistributions
  signature: void BotCharacterDistribution::ReloadDistributions()
documentation:
  brief: Reloads all bot character distribution configurations from the database or
    configuration files.
  description: The ReloadDistributions method refreshes the internal cache of bot
    character distribution settings, ensuring that any changes made to the underlying
    database tables or configuration files are reflected in the active game state.
    This method is typically invoked when administrators need to update bot behavior
    rules without restarting the server. It may involve re-reading data from the 'bot_character_distribution'
    table and recalculating or reinitializing distribution logic for various bot types
    and levels. The operation is generally non-blocking but can cause temporary performance
    degradation during reload.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reload Bot Distributions Command
    code: BotCharacterDistribution::instance()->ReloadDistributions();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in production environments as it may
    temporarily disrupt bot behavior until the reload is complete. The reload process
    might involve locking tables or temporary data invalidation.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively using distribution logic could
    lead to inconsistent behavior until the reload completes. It's recommended to
    execute this during low-traffic periods or when no active bots are using the affected
    distributions.
