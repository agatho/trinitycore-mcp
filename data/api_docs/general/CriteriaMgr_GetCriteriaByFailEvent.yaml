  class: CriteriaMgr
  method: GetCriteriaByFailEvent
  signature: const CriteriaList * CriteriaMgr::GetCriteriaByFailEvent(int failEvent,
    int32 asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of criteria associated with a specific failure event and
    asset in the TrinityCore framework.
  description: 'The GetCriteriaByFailEvent method is used to fetch a collection of
    criteria that are triggered or linked when a specified failure event occurs within
    the game context. This function is typically employed in achievement or quest
    systems where certain conditions must be met upon failure of an action. The method
    takes two parameters: failEvent, which identifies the type of failure event, and
    asset, which may represent additional context such as a quest ID or objective
    index. It returns a pointer to a CriteriaList containing all matching criteria
    entries, or nullptr if no criteria are found for the given event and asset combination.'
  parameters:
  - name: failEvent
    description: An integer identifier representing the type of failure event that
      triggers the criteria lookup. This value corresponds to predefined failure event
      types within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: asset
    description: A signed 32-bit integer used as a contextual parameter for the failure
      event, often representing identifiers like quest IDs, objective indices, or
      other relevant data associated with the event.
  returns: A pointer to a const CriteriaList object containing criteria entries linked
    to the specified failure event and asset. Returns nullptr if no matching criteria
    are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve criteria for a quest failure
    code: "const CriteriaList* criteria = criteriaMgr->GetCriteriaByFailEvent(QUEST_FAIL_EVENT,\
      \ 12345);\nif (criteria)\n{\n    // Process the list of criteria\n    for (auto&\
      \ criterion : *criteria)\n    {\n        // Handle each criterion\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for criteria on a specific objective failure
    code: "const CriteriaList* critList = criteriaMgr->GetCriteriaByFailEvent(OBJECTIVE_FAIL_EVENT,\
      \ 67890);\nif (critList && !critList->empty())\n{\n    // Apply logic based\
      \ on found criteria\n    for (const auto& criterion : *critList)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Evaluate each criterion's requirements\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ No criteria defined for this failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal criteria management system and should
    be used carefully within the context of achievement or quest handling. The CriteriaList
    returned by this function is read-only and must not be modified directly to avoid
    unintended side effects in the game logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value indicates valid or active criteria;
    always verify the contents of the CriteriaList before processing. Improper use
    of this method can lead to incorrect achievement progression or quest behavior.
