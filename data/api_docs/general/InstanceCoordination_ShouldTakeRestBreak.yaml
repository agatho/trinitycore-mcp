  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: ShouldTakeRestBreak
  signature: bool InstanceCoordination::ShouldTakeRestBreak(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group should take a rest break during instance coordination.
  description: The ShouldTakeRestBreak method evaluates if a player group is eligible
    to take a rest break within an instance environment. This method typically checks
    various conditions such as group composition, instance rules, player states, and
    cooldowns to determine if resting is permitted. It's commonly used in conjunction
    with instance management systems to enforce game balance and prevent abuse of
    resting mechanics during challenging encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group should take a rest break based on instance coordination
    rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Logic
    code: "if (instanceCoordination->ShouldTakeRestBreak(playerGroup)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ group to rest\n    playerGroup->SetResting(true);\n} else {\n    // Prevent\
      \ resting and enforce instance rules\n    playerGroup->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Resting is not allowed at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal instance state tracking and group
    management systems. Developers should ensure that all relevant game mechanics
    are considered when implementing custom logic based on this check.
  warnings: Improper implementation of rest break logic could lead to unbalanced gameplay
    or exploit opportunities. Ensure that all conditions are properly validated before
    allowing resting.
