  method: GetRelevance
  signature: float Action::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the relevance score of an action for use in bot decision-making.
  description: The GetRelevance method calculates and returns a float value representing
    how relevant or important the current action is within the context of the AI's
    decision-making process. This score is typically used by the BotAI system to prioritize
    actions when multiple options are available. The relevance score can influence
    which action gets executed next, with higher scores generally indicating more
    urgent or beneficial actions to perform. The method takes into account various
    factors such as target conditions, resource availability, and situational context
    to determine this score.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of the action. Higher values
    indicate greater relevance or priority for execution. The exact range and interpretation
    may vary based on implementation details but typically ranges from 0.0 (least
    relevant) to 1.0 (most relevant).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in BotAI Context
    code: "float relevance = action->GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.7f)\n{\n\
      \    // Execute high-priority action\n    ai->ExecuteAction(action);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Action Relevances
    code: "Action* currentAction = ai->GetCurrentAction();\nAction* nextAction = ai->GetNextAction();\n\
      \nfloat currentRelevance = currentAction->GetRelevance(ai);\nfloat nextRelevance\
      \ = nextAction->GetRelevance(ai);\n\nif (nextRelevance > currentRelevance)\n\
      {\n    // Switch to more relevant action\n    ai->SetCurrentAction(nextAction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making cycle and
    should be implemented efficiently as it may be invoked frequently. The relevance
    calculation might involve checking target health, distance, threat level, or other
    contextual factors depending on the specific action type.
  warnings: The returned relevance score should not be used directly for action execution
    without proper validation. Ensure that the BotAI context is valid before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
