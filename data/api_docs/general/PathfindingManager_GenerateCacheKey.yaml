  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GenerateCacheKey
  signature: std::string PathfindingManager::GenerateCacheKey(const int & start, const
    int & goal)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique cache key for pathfinding between two nodes.
  description: The GenerateCacheKey method creates a deterministic string identifier
    based on the start and goal node indices provided. This cache key is used to store
    and retrieve precomputed pathfinding results in the PathfindingManager's internal
    cache, improving performance by avoiding redundant calculations. The generated
    key typically combines both node identifiers in a consistent format to ensure
    that paths between the same nodes always produce the same cache key. This method
    is essential for efficient pathfinding operations in TrinityCore's navigation
    system, particularly when dealing with dynamic environments where paths may need
    to be recalculated but can benefit from caching.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The index or identifier of the starting node for pathfinding. This
      represents the source location in the navigation mesh.
  - name: goal
    description: The index or identifier of the goal node for pathfinding. This represents
      the destination location in the navigation mesh.
  returns: A std::string representing the unique cache key for the specified start
    and goal nodes. The format typically combines both node identifiers in a consistent
    manner to ensure deterministic caching behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = ...;

      int startNode = 100;

      int goalNode = 200;

      std::string cacheKey = manager->GenerateCacheKey(startNode, goalNode);

      // Resulting cacheKey might be something like "100_200" or similar format'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be fast and deterministic. It should not perform
    any heavy computations or I/O operations. The cache key generation algorithm must
    remain consistent across different runs of the application to ensure proper caching
    behavior.
