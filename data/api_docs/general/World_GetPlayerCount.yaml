api:
  class: World
  method: GetPlayerCount
  signature: uint32 World::GetPlayerCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of connected players on the server.
  description: The GetPlayerCount method retrieves the total count of players currently
    logged into and connected to the World of Warcraft server. This value represents
    all active player sessions in the game world, including both regular players and
    those who may be in specific game states such as being in a battleground or instance.
    The method provides a real-time snapshot of server population and is commonly
    used for server monitoring, load balancing, and game logic that depends on player
    presence. It's important to note that this count includes all connected players
    regardless of their location within the game world or their current activity status.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of currently connected players
    on the server. This number will be zero if no players are logged in, and will
    increase as players log in and decrease as they log out.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Player Count
    code: "void ShowCurrentPlayerCount()\n{\n    uint32 playerCount = sWorld->GetPlayerCount();\n\
      \    printf(\"Current number of players online: %u\\n\", playerCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Player Count for Server Load Management
    code: "void CheckServerLoad()\n{\n    uint32 playerCount = sWorld->GetPlayerCount();\n\
      \    if (playerCount > 1000)\n    {\n        // Trigger high-load handling\n\
      \        sWorld->SetMaxPlayerCount(1200);\n    }\n    else if (playerCount <\
      \ 100)\n    {\n        // Trigger low-load handling\n        sWorld->SetMaxPlayerCount(500);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value is updated in real-time as players connect or disconnect, making
    it suitable for dynamic server management systems. Performance-wise, this operation
    is lightweight since it typically involves a simple atomic read of an internal
    counter maintained by the World object.
  warnings: While this method provides the current player count, it does not distinguish
    between different types of player sessions (e.g., regular players vs. GMs, or
    players in different zones). Also, be aware that during server shutdown or maintenance
    periods, the value may fluctuate as players are disconnected.
