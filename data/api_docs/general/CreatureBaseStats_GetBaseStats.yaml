  class: CreatureBaseStats
  method: GetBaseStats
  signature: const CreatureBaseStats * CreatureBaseStats::GetBaseStats(uint8 level,
    uint8 unitClass)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves base statistics for a creature based on its level and class.
  description: The GetBaseStats method fetches the base statistics for a creature
    in World of Warcraft, specifically tailored to the creature's level and unit class.
    This function is typically used by the game engine to determine default health,
    mana, damage, and other combat-related attributes for creatures at different levels
    and classes. It serves as a lookup mechanism that accesses pre-defined creature
    stat tables within the TrinityCore database or static data structures. The returned
    pointer points to a constant structure, ensuring that base stats cannot be modified
    through this interface, which maintains data integrity during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level of the creature for which to retrieve base statistics.
      Valid range is typically 1-255, though actual supported levels depend on game
      content and expansion.
  - name: unitClass
    description: The unit class identifier of the creature (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue).
      This value corresponds to the UnitClass enum or similar classification system
      used internally by TrinityCore to categorize creature types.
  returns: A pointer to a constant CreatureBaseStats structure containing the base
    statistics for the specified level and class. Returns nullptr if no matching stats
    are found for the given parameters, indicating that either an invalid level or
    unit class was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const CreatureBaseStats* stats = creatureBaseStats->GetBaseStats(60, CLASS_WARRIOR);\n\
      if (stats != nullptr) {\n    // Use stats for creature initialization\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Base Health: \" << stats->baseHealth << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "const CreatureBaseStats* stats = creatureBaseStats->GetBaseStats(1000,\
      \ CLASS_MAGE);\nif (stats == nullptr) {\n    // Handle invalid level or class\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Invalid creature stats requested for level %u and\
      \ class %u\", 1000, CLASS_MAGE);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with valid stats\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or map structure that
    maps (level, unitClass) pairs to precomputed CreatureBaseStats objects. The implementation
    may involve caching or static initialization for performance reasons, as creature
    base stats are frequently accessed during creature creation and gameplay. The
    returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid only for the duration of the current
    game tick or until the next call to GetBaseStats.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned CreatureBaseStats structure through
    the returned pointer, as it points to a constant object. Modifying it will result
    in undefined behavior or compilation errors. Also, be aware that invalid combinations
    of level and unitClass may return nullptr, so always check for null before dereferencing
    the result.
