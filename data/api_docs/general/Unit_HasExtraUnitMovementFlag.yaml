documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a specific extra movement flag set.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object possesses a particular
    extra movement flag, which is used to control various movement behaviors and states
    in World of Warcraft. The function accepts a uint32 parameter representing the
    movement flag to check for, and returns true if that flag is currently set on
    the unit. This functionality is essential for managing unit movement states, particularly
    in scenarios involving special movement types like flying, swimming, or other
    custom movement flags. The method is commonly used in conjunction with movement-related
    systems to ensure proper handling of unit behavior during different game states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified extra movement flag is set on the unit, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HasExtraUnitMovementFlag(MOVEMENTFLAG_FLYING)) {\n    // Unit\
      \ is currently flying\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    functions to determine the current state of a unit's movement. It's important
    to note that this flag checking mechanism is part of the broader movement system
    and may be affected by various game mechanics such as aura effects or movement
    restrictions.
