  class: Battlefield
  method: OnPlayerJoinWar
  signature: void Battlefield::OnPlayerJoinWar(Player * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player joins a battlefield during a war.
  description: The OnPlayerJoinWar method is invoked when a player successfully joins
    a battlefield instance during an active war. This method typically performs necessary
    setup and initialization for the player within the battlefield context, such as
    updating player state, applying battlefield-specific buffs or debuffs, synchronizing
    player data with the battlefield system, and potentially triggering related events
    or notifications. The method ensures that the player is properly integrated into
    the ongoing battlefield combat mechanics and that their actions are correctly
    tracked within the battlefield framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who joined the
      battlefield war.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom battlefield handler
    code: "class MyBattlefield : public Battlefield\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerJoinWar(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when player joins battlefield\n\
      \        player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Welcome to the battlefield!\");\n\
      \        // Apply initial battlefield effects\n        player->AddAura(12345,\
      \ player); // Example aura\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player enters a battlefield zone during an active war. Developers should ensure
    that any custom logic implemented here does not interfere with core battlefield
    mechanics or cause performance bottlenecks. The method may be invoked multiple
    times for the same player if they rejoin a battlefield after leaving.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or database operations within this
    method as it can block the game loop and affect performance. Do not call methods
    that might recursively trigger battlefield events, which could lead to stack overflow
    or unexpected behavior.
