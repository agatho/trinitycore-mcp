  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSplitGuildBankItem(WorldPackets::Guild::SplitGuildBankItem
    & splitGuildBankItem)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild bank item split request from a player.
  description: Handles the client-initiated request to split a stack of items in the
    guild bank into two separate stacks. This method validates the player's permissions,
    checks if the split operation is valid (e.g., sufficient item count, proper slot
    positions), and then performs the split by updating both the source and destination
    slots in the guild bank. The operation requires the player to be a member of a
    guild with appropriate permissions to manage the guild bank. This method is part
    of the WorldSession's packet handling system for guild-related operations.
  parameters:
  - name: splitGuildBankItem
    description: A packet structure containing information about the item split request,
      including source and destination slot positions, and the quantity to be moved.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic guild bank item split handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSplitGuildBankItem(WorldPackets::Guild::SplitGuildBankItem\
      \ & splitGuildBankItem)\n{\n    // Validate player is in a guild\n    if (!GetPlayer()->GetGuildId())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Process the split operation\n    GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->SplitItemInBank(splitGuildBankItem);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the WorldSession's packet processing
    pipeline when a client sends a guild bank item split request. It assumes that
    the player has already been validated for guild membership and permissions. The
    actual item movement logic is delegated to the Guild class.
