  signature: void MonkAI::HandleAdvancedMistweaverManagement()
documentation:
  brief: Manages advanced mistweaver abilities and resource optimization for the Monk
    AI.
  description: The HandleAdvancedMistweaverManagement method is responsible for implementing
    sophisticated decision-making logic specific to the Mistweaver monk class in the
    TrinityCore AI system. This method evaluates the current state of the monk's resources,
    such as mana and chi, and makes intelligent decisions about when to use abilities
    like Renewing Mist, Essence Font, and other core mechanics. It ensures optimal
    resource allocation and ability usage based on combat conditions, target health
    percentages, and cooldown states. The method integrates with the broader MonkAI
    framework to provide a cohesive and efficient gameplay experience for Mistweaver
    monks within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    HandleAdvancedMistweaverManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked after all basic state checks have been performed. It assumes that the
    monk's current target and combat state are properly initialized. The implementation
    may involve complex calculations related to spell priorities, resource management,
    and timing decisions.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method without proper AI state setup can lead
    to incorrect ability usage or resource mismanagement. Developers should ensure
    that all prerequisite conditions for mistweaver abilities are met before calling
    this method.
