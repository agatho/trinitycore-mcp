  class: ThreatReference
  method: IsAvailable
  signature: bool ThreatReference::IsAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the threat reference is currently valid and usable within
    the game system.
  description: The IsAvailable method determines if a ThreatReference object is in
    a valid state for use. This typically checks if the referenced unit or entity
    still exists, is not in an invalid state, and can be safely used for threat calculations
    or related operations. The method ensures that attempting to access or modify
    threat data through this reference won't result in undefined behavior or crashes
    due to dangling pointers or destroyed objects. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, threat references are commonly used in AI systems and combat mechanics
    where units maintain threat tables for mobs and players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat reference is valid and can be safely used; returns
    false if the reference is invalid, stale, or points to a destroyed entity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (threatRef.IsAvailable()) {\n    // Safe to perform threat-related operations\n\
      \    Unit* target = threatRef.GetTarget();\n    if (target) {\n        // Process\
      \ threat logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Threat Management in Combat System
    code: "void UpdateThreatList() {\n    for (auto& ref : threatList) {\n       \
      \ if (!ref.IsAvailable()) {\n            // Remove invalid references from list\n\
      \            ref = nullptr;\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Proceed\
      \ with valid threat reference processing\n        ProcessThreat(ref);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal checks such as verifying if the referenced
    object is still alive, not in a deletion queue, and hasn't been marked as invalid
    by the game engine. It's recommended to call this method before any operation
    that relies on the threat reference to prevent runtime errors.
  warnings: Do not assume that a ThreatReference remains valid indefinitely. Always
    check IsAvailable() before using the reference, especially in asynchronous or
    multi-threaded contexts where the referenced object might be destroyed between
    checks.
