  brief: Plays a specified animation kit on the unit
  description: This method plays a one-shot animation kit on the Unit, which is typically
    used for visual effects like casting spells or performing actions. The animation
    kit ID parameter specifies which animation to play, and it's usually a predefined
    value in the game database. This method is commonly used in conjunction with spell
    effects or other gameplay mechanics where visual animations are required.
  parameters:
  - name: animKitId
    description: The animation kit ID to play, which defines the specific animation
      sequence to execute. This value typically corresponds to entries in the AnimationKit.db2
      file and is usually a 16-bit integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:

  notes: The method is typically used for visual effects and does not directly affect
    gameplay mechanics. It's important to note that the animation kit ID must be valid
    and correspond to an existing animation in the database.
  warnings: This method should only be called on units that are capable of performing
    animations, such as players or NPCs. Calling this method on units without proper
    animation support may result in no visual effect or errors.
