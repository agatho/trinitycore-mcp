  signature: void PossessedAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming units that come within the possessed creature's line of
    sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core component of the PossessedAI
    class, responsible for handling units that enter the possessed creature's line
    of sight. This method is typically invoked by the game engine when a unit (such
    as a player or NPC) moves into the creature's detection range. It enables the
    possessed AI to react to nearby entities, potentially initiating combat behavior,
    following targets, or performing other AI-driven actions based on the possessed
    creature's specific implementation. The method does not take any parameters and
    is part of the standard AI update loop in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update
    code: "void PossessedAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // This method is called internally during movement\
      \ updates\n    MoveInLineOfSight(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the core game engine when units enter
    the creature's line of sight. It should not be manually invoked unless in very
    specific custom AI scenarios. The implementation likely includes checks for unit
    visibility, faction detection, and threat updates.
  warnings: Do not override this method without understanding its role in the AI system.
    Incorrectly modifying or bypassing it may lead to unexpected behavior such as
    creatures failing to detect targets or improper combat engagement.
