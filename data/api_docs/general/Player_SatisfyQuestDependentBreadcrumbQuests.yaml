documentation:
  brief: Satisfies breadcrumb quests dependent on a specific quest
  description: This method processes and satisfies all breadcrumb quests that are
    dependent on the provided quest information. It checks if the player has completed
    the necessary conditions to fulfill these dependent quests, typically used during
    quest completion or advancement. The method is part of the quest system's internal
    mechanics and ensures proper quest progression when a quest is completed.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that serves as the basis for determining
      dependent breadcrumb quests. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send messages to the player about
      quest completion. If true, relevant messages are sent; if false, no messages
      are sent.
  returns: Returns true if all dependent breadcrumb quests were successfully satisfied,
    otherwise false. The method may return false if the player lacks the necessary
    conditions or if the quest system fails to properly process the dependent quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      bool result = player->SatisfyQuestDependentBreadcrumbQuests(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during quest completion or advancement and
    may involve internal checks for quest dependencies. It's important to note that
    the method does not directly modify quest progress but rather ensures proper fulfillment
    of dependent quests.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to quest progression issues,
    where dependent quests might not be properly satisfied, causing players to remain
    stuck in quest progression loops. Always ensure that qInfo parameter is valid
    before calling this method.
