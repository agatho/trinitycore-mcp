  class: CreatureAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void CreatureAI::AttackStart(int * victim)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior against a specified target for the creature AI.
  description: The AttackStart method is used to begin the combat behavior of a CreatureAI
    instance, targeting a specific victim. This method typically triggers the AI to
    engage in melee or ranged attacks depending on the creature's defined behavior
    and weapon type. It is commonly invoked when a creature detects an enemy within
    its aggro range or when explicitly commanded to attack a target. The method sets
    up the necessary state for combat, including target tracking and attack scheduling.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: Pointer to the target entity that the creature will begin attacking.
      This parameter must point to a valid GameObject or Unit object representing
      the enemy target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attack Start Usage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      Player* target = ...;

      creature->AI()->AttackStart(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Attack Start
    code: "if (creature->IsHostileTo(target))\n{\n    creature->AI()->AttackStart(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly perform damage calculations; it only initiates
    the attack sequence. The actual combat mechanics are handled by other AI methods
    such as UpdateAI and DoMeleeAttack. Ensure that the victim pointer is valid before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling AttackStart with a null or invalid victim pointer may result in
    crashes or unexpected behavior. Always validate the target before initiating an
    attack. Additionally, calling this method repeatedly without proper cooldowns
    can cause performance issues.
