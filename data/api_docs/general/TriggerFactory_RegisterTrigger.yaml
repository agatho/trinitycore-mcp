  method: RegisterTrigger
  signature: void TriggerFactory::RegisterTrigger(const std::string & name, std::function<std::shared_ptr<Trigger>
    ()> creator)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new trigger creator function with the specified name in the TriggerFactory.
  description: The RegisterTrigger method allows developers to register a trigger
    creation factory function under a specific name within the TriggerFactory. This
    enables dynamic instantiation of different trigger types at runtime based on the
    registered name. The method takes a string identifier and a std::function that
    returns a std::shared_ptr<Trigger>, allowing for flexible and extensible trigger
    system design. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to support
    modular trigger systems such as quest triggers, event triggers, or custom game
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the trigger type being registered.
      This name will be used later to retrieve and instantiate the trigger.
  - name: creator
    description: A std::function object that takes no parameters and returns a std::shared_ptr<Trigger>.
      This function is invoked when a trigger of the specified name needs to be instantiated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Registration
    code: "TriggerFactory::Instance()->RegisterTrigger(\"QuestStart\", []() {\n  \
      \  return std::make_shared<QuestStartTrigger>();\n});"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Trigger Registration with Parameters
    code: "TriggerFactory::Instance()->RegisterTrigger(\"SpellCast\", [](const std::string&\
      \ spellName) {\n    return std::make_shared<SpellCastTrigger>(spellName);\n\
      });"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or module loading
    to register all available trigger types. The registration process is thread-safe,
    but it's recommended to perform all registrations before the server begins accepting
    connections. The factory pattern used here allows for easy extension of trigger
    functionality without modifying existing code.
  warnings: Registering a trigger with an already-existing name will overwrite the
    previous registration, potentially causing unexpected behavior if not handled
    carefully. Ensure that trigger names are unique and descriptive to avoid conflicts
    in large modded environments.
