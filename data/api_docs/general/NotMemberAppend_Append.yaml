documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    object for players not currently in the channel.
  description: The NotMemberAppend::Append method is responsible for populating a
    WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet with relevant information when a player
    attempts to perform an action on a channel they are not a member of. This typically
    occurs during operations such as sending messages to a channel, requesting channel
    information, or attempting to join a channel that requires specific permissions.
    The method ensures that appropriate error messages and status codes are included
    in the notification packet so that the client can properly respond to the user's
    request. It is part of TrinityCore's channel management system and handles scenarios
    where access control prevents a player from interacting with certain channels.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify object that
      will be populated with notification data for non-member actions.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in channel access control
    code: 'NotMemberAppend append;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);

      // The notifyPacket now contains appropriate error data for non-member access'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with channel command handler
    code: "void HandleChannelMessage(ChatHandler* handler, std::string const& channelName)\
      \ {\n    if (!handler->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->InChannel(channelName)) {\n\
      \        NotMemberAppend append;\n        WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify\
      \ notifyPacket;\n        append.Append(notifyPacket);\n        handler->SendPacket(&notifyPacket);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // ... normal message handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the context of channel-related operations
    where access control checks have failed. It's important to note that this method
    does not perform any validation or authentication itself; it simply formats the
    response packet for non-member scenarios. The actual logic determining whether
    a player is a member should be handled before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when a player is confirmed to not
    be a member of the target channel, otherwise incorrect error messages may be sent
    to the client. Improper use could lead to misleading UI feedback for players attempting
    to interact with channels they do not belong to.
