  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: SetMinDataPoints
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::SetMinDataPoints(uint32_t points)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum number of data points required for learning analytics processing.
  description: The SetMinDataPoints method configures the minimum threshold of data
    points that must be collected before the LearningAnalytics system begins processing
    or generating insights. This parameter is crucial for ensuring that analytics
    are only performed when sufficient data is available, preventing unreliable results
    from being generated with sparse datasets. The value typically represents the
    number of observations or samples needed to achieve statistical significance in
    the learning algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: points
    description: The minimum number of data points required for analytics processing.
      Must be a positive integer value representing the count of observations needed
      before analysis can commence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Minimum Data Points to 100
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.SetMinDataPoints(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Analytics Threshold for High Accuracy
    code: "LearningAnalytics* analytics = sWorld->GetLearningAnalytics();\nif (analytics)\n\
      {\n    analytics->SetMinDataPoints(500);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during system initialization or configuration
    phases. The value set here directly impacts when learning algorithms will begin
    processing data, which can affect performance and accuracy of the analytics results.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may result in unreliable analytics due to insufficient
    data, while setting it too high may delay analysis completion unnecessarily. Ensure
    that the chosen value aligns with available data collection capabilities and desired
    accuracy thresholds.
