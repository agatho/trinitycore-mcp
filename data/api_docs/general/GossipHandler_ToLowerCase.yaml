  method: ToLowerCase
  signature: std::string GossipHandler::ToLowerCase(const std::string & text) const
documentation:
  brief: Converts the input string to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison in
    gossip interactions.
  description: The ToLowerCase method takes a const reference to a std::string and
    returns a new std::string with all characters converted to their lowercase equivalents.
    This utility function is commonly used within the GossipHandler class to normalize
    user input or NPC dialogue text when performing case-insensitive matching operations
    during quest interactions, gossip menu selections, or command processing. The
    method ensures consistent string comparison regardless of input case, which is
    essential for maintaining reliable gameplay mechanics in TrinityCore's gossip
    system. It does not modify the original string but creates and returns a new transformed
    string.
  parameters: []
  returns: A new std::string containing the lowercase version of the input text. The
    returned string will be identical in length to the input, with all alphabetic
    characters converted to lowercase while preserving non-alphabetic characters such
    as numbers, spaces, and punctuation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for gossip menu matching
    code: "std::string userInput = \"Hello World\";\nstd::string lowerInput = GossipHandler::ToLowerCase(userInput);\n\
      // Result: \"hello world\"\nif (lowerInput == \"hello world\") {\n    // Process\
      \ greeting\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Case-insensitive quest name comparison
    code: "std::string questName = \"The Lost Artifact\";\nstd::string userInput =\
      \ \"THE LOST ARTIFACT\";\nif (GossipHandler::ToLowerCase(questName) == GossipHandler::ToLowerCase(userInput))\
      \ {\n    // Accept quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses standard C++ locale-aware character conversion. For performance-critical
    sections involving many string conversions, consider caching results or using
    pre-converted strings where possible. The implementation is thread-safe as it
    operates on local copies of input data without side effects.
  warnings: Be aware that this function only converts ASCII alphabetic characters
    to lowercase. Unicode or non-ASCII characters may not be handled correctly in
    all locales. For internationalized text processing, additional locale-specific
    handling might be required.
