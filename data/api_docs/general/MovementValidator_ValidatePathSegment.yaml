  class: MovementValidator
  method: ValidatePathSegment
  signature: bool MovementValidator::ValidatePathSegment(Player * bot, const int &
    start, const int & end) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates a path segment between two points for a player character.
  description: The ValidatePathSegment method checks whether a movement path between
    specified start and end points is valid for a given player character. It evaluates
    path feasibility based on terrain, obstacles, and game mechanics constraints.
    This validation ensures that bots or AI-controlled characters do not attempt invalid
    movements that would result in failure or client-side errors. The method typically
    integrates with TrinityCore's movement system to verify path integrity before
    execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose movement
      is being validated.
  - name: start
    description: Integer index or identifier representing the starting point of the
      path segment.
  - name: end
    description: Integer index or identifier representing the ending point of the
      path segment.
  returns: Returns true if the path segment from start to end is valid and can be
    traversed by the player; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Validation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized\nint start = 0;\nint end = 5;\n\
      bool isValid = MovementValidator().ValidatePathSegment(bot, start, end);\nif\
      \ (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Logic
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool MoveToTarget(Player* bot, int targetIndex)\
      \ {\n        int currentPos = GetCurrentPosition(bot);\n        if (MovementValidator().ValidatePathSegment(bot,\
      \ currentPos, targetIndex)) {\n            // Execute movement\n           \
      \ return true;\n        }\n        return false; // Invalid path\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal pathfinding algorithms and collision detection
    to determine validity. It may cache previous validation results for performance
    optimization in frequently accessed paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the start and end indices are within valid bounds to prevent
    undefined behavior or crashes. Incorrect usage of invalid indices can lead to
    assertion failures or memory corruption.
