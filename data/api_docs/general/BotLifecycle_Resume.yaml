documentation:
  brief: Resumes the bot lifecycle, continuing execution after a previous suspension.
  description: The Resume method in the BotLifecycle class is responsible for resuming
    the execution flow of a bot that was previously suspended. This typically occurs
    when a bot's operations have been paused due to external conditions such as server
    load, player interaction, or administrative commands. The method ensures that
    the bot continues from its last known state, maintaining continuity in its behavior
    and task execution. It is commonly used in conjunction with the Pause method to
    provide controlled execution management for AI-driven characters within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Basic Bot Resume Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycle* botLifecycle = player->GetBotLifecycle();

      botLifecycle->Resume();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on a bot that has been previously paused.
    Calling Resume on an already running bot may have undefined behavior. The implementation
    likely involves updating internal state flags and rescheduling any pending tasks
    or timers.
  warnings: Calling Resume without prior Pause may lead to inconsistent bot behavior
    or unexpected execution states. Ensure proper synchronization when calling this
    method in multi-threaded environments.
