  method: SendRaidGroupOnlyMessage
  signature: void Player::SendRaidGroupOnlyMessage(int reason, int32 delay) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a raid group-only message to the player's party members with specified
    reason and delay.
  description: This method sends a special message to all players in the player's
    raid group, informing them of a specific reason for the message with a configurable
    delay. The message is only sent to players within the same raid group, not to
    other party members or players outside the raid. It is typically used for communication
    purposes such as notifying raid members about events, changes, or status updates.
    The method allows for customization of the reason and delay parameters, making
    it flexible for various in-game scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: The reason code for the message, indicating why the message is being
      sent. This could be a predefined value or custom code depending on the context.
  - name: delay
    description: The delay in milliseconds before the message is sent. A negative
      value indicates immediate sending, while positive values allow for delayed delivery.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendRaidGroupOnlyMessage(100, 500);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      int reason = 200;

      int32 delay = 1000;

      player->SendRaidGroupOnlyMessage(reason, delay);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with raid group management and
    communication systems. It should be used carefully to avoid sending unnecessary
    messages to players. The delay parameter allows for timing control, which can
    be useful for coordinating events or actions within the raid group.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to confusion or incorrect messaging
    in a raid group. Care should be taken when choosing the reason and delay values
    to ensure proper communication.
