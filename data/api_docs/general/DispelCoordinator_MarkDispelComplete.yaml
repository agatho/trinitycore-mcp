documentation:
  brief: Marks a dispel assignment as complete within the coordinator
  description: The MarkDispelComplete method is responsible for signaling that a specific
    dispel assignment has been successfully processed and completed. This method updates
    internal state tracking to reflect that the dispel operation associated with the
    provided assignment is no longer active or pending. It typically involves removing
    the assignment from active tracking lists, notifying dependent systems, and potentially
    triggering follow-up actions such as updating player status or releasing resources.
    The method operates on a DispelAssignment object which contains all relevant information
    about the dispel being marked complete.
  parameters:
  - name: assignment
    description: A const reference to a DispelAssignment object that represents the
      specific dispel operation to be marked as complete. This object should contain
      valid assignment data including target information, dispel type, and any associated
      identifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MarkDispelComplete
    code: 'DispelAssignment assignment;

      // ... populate assignment with relevant data ...

      coordinator.MarkDispelComplete(assignment);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the dispel system when a dispel
    operation reaches its completion state. It's important that the DispelAssignment
    passed to this method is valid and properly initialized, as invalid data could
    lead to inconsistent internal state or unexpected behavior.
