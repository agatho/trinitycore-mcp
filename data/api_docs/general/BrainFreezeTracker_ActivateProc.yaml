  class: BrainFreezeTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void BrainFreezeTracker::ActivateProc()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the Brain Freeze proc mechanism for the associated spell or effect.
  description: The ActivateProc method enables the Brain Freeze effect, which typically
    occurs when a specific spell or ability is cast that triggers the proc. This method
    likely sets internal flags or state variables to indicate that the proc is active
    and ready to be triggered by subsequent events. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    Mage class abilities, this could relate to the Brain Freeze talent that reduces
    the cast time of Frost spells after casting certain abilities. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations, but may modify
    internal state or trigger related callbacks within the spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void FrostboltSpell::HandleHit()\n{\n    // Trigger Brain Freeze proc activation\n\
      \    brainFreezeTracker.ActivateProc();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger spell proc system and may be called
    internally by the core engine when certain conditions are met. It's important
    to ensure that ActivateProc is only called when appropriate to avoid unintended
    behavior or exploits in gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method could lead to incorrect proc activation
    timing, potentially causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior for players
    using Mage Frost abilities.
