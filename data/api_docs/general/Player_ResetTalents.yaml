documentation:
  brief: Resets the player's talent points and returns true if successful.
  description: The ResetTalents method resets all talent points for the player, allowing
    them to relearn talents from scratch. This method is commonly used during character
    creation or when a player wishes to reset their talents without spending any gold.
    The method returns true if the reset was successful and false otherwise. It typically
    requires the player to be in a state where they can spend talent points, such
    as being in a trainer's presence or having sufficient available talent points.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the talent reset was successful, false otherwise. The method
    may return false if the player does not have enough talent points or if the reset
    process fails due to game mechanics restrictions.
  examples:

      \ now relearn talents\n}"
