  signature: bool ResourceManager::WillHaveEnoughIn(ResourceType type, uint32 amount,
    uint32 timeMs)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if a resource will be sufficient within a specified time period
  description: The WillHaveEnoughIn method evaluates whether the current resource
    balance will be sufficient to meet a future demand over a given time interval.
    It considers the resource type, required amount, and time duration to predict
    availability. This method is commonly used in game mechanics for resource management,
    crafting systems, and quest progression checks where future resource consumption
    needs to be anticipated. The function typically accounts for resource generation
    rates, existing reserves, and any pending consumptions during the specified timeframe.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ResourceType enum value identifying which type of resource to
      evaluate (e.g., gold, mana, health, or custom resources). Must be a valid resource
      type defined in the ResourceManager.
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of the specified resource that is required. Must be
      a non-negative integer representing the amount needed.
  - name: timeMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds over which the resource requirement
      will be evaluated. Must be a positive integer indicating how long into the future
      to check resource sufficiency.
  returns: Returns true if the resource manager predicts that sufficient resources
    will be available within the specified time period; otherwise returns false. The
    method may also return false if the resource type is invalid or if the time interval
    is zero.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player has enough gold in 5 minutes
    code: "if (resourceManager.WillHaveEnoughIn(ResourceType::GOLD, 1000, 300000))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with purchase\n    std::cout << \"Sufficient gold available\
      \ in 5 minutes\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Notify player or delay action\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Not enough gold available in 5 minutes\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Verify mana availability for spell casting
    code: "uint32 requiredMana = 50;\nuint32 timeToCast = 1000; // 1 second\nif (resourceManager.WillHaveEnoughIn(ResourceType::MANA,\
      \ requiredMana, timeToCast)) {\n    // Allow spell to be cast\n    player.CastSpell(spellId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Schedule spell or show error message\n    player.SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough mana to cast this spell now.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform calculations based on resource regeneration rates,
    which could vary per resource type and player state. It's recommended to call
    this function before committing to actions that depend on future resource availability
    to prevent invalid operations or game state inconsistencies.
  warnings: The method might not account for external factors such as temporary resource
    modifiers, buffs, or debuffs that could affect actual resource generation rates.
    Additionally, in high-frequency scenarios, repeated calls may impact performance
    due to internal calculations and potential database lookups.
