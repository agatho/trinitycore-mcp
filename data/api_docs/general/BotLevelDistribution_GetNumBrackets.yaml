  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: GetNumBrackets
  signature: uint32 BotLevelDistribution::GetNumBrackets() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of level brackets defined in the bot level distribution
    configuration.
  description: The GetNumBrackets method retrieves the count of distinct level brackets
    that are configured within the BotLevelDistribution class. This is typically used
    to determine how many different level ranges or tiers exist for bot character
    creation or assignment. The method provides a simple way to iterate over all available
    brackets or validate the configuration. It does not perform any calculations or
    dynamic updates; it simply returns a cached value representing the static number
    of brackets defined in the distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of level brackets configured
    in the BotLevelDistribution instance. This value is typically used for loop bounds
    or array indexing when accessing bracket-specific data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Iterate Brackets
    code: "BotLevelDistribution distribution;\nuint32 numBrackets = distribution.GetNumBrackets();\n\
      for (uint32 i = 0; i < numBrackets; ++i)\n{\n    // Access bracket data using\
      \ index i\n    // e.g., distribution.GetBracketInfo(i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Configuration Before Use
    code: "BotLevelDistribution distribution;\nuint32 numBrackets = distribution.GetNumBrackets();\n\
      if (numBrackets == 0)\n{\n    // Handle invalid configuration\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Bot level distribution has no brackets defined!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(\"\
      Loaded %u bot level brackets\", numBrackets);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a precomputed value. It's likely
    optimized for performance and should not be called frequently in tight loops.
    The returned value reflects the static configuration at the time of object initialization
    or last update, not dynamic runtime changes.
