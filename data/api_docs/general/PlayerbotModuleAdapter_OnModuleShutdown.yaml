documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for the player bot module
  description: The OnModuleShutdown method is called when the player bot module is
    being unloaded or shut down. This method handles necessary cleanup tasks such
    as releasing resources, saving persistent data, and ensuring proper termination
    of any active bot behaviors or processes. It serves as the primary entry point
    for module deinitialization within the TrinityCore player bot system. The method
    is invoked automatically by the core framework during module unload operations
    and should not be called manually unless specifically required by custom extensions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Module shutdown cleanup
    code: "class MyPlayerbotModule : public PlayerbotModuleAdapter\n{\npublic:\n \
      \   void OnModuleShutdown() override\n    {\n        // Save any pending bot\
      \ data\n        SaveBotData();\n        \n        // Clean up allocated resources\n\
      \        CleanupResources();\n        \n        // Log shutdown event\n    \
      \    sLog->outString(\"MyPlayerbotModule: Shutdown complete\");\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the module's unload sequence and should not
    perform operations that might block or take significant time. It's recommended
    to keep shutdown operations lightweight to avoid delaying the server's shutdown
    process. The method may be invoked multiple times during a server's lifetime,
    particularly during hot-reloads of modules.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy I/O operations or locking operations within this
    method as it can cause server delays or deadlocks during shutdown. Do not assume
    that all subsystems are still available when this method is called, as the shutdown
    sequence may have already begun.
