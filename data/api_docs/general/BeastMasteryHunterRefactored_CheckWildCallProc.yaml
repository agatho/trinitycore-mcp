  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::CheckWildCallProc()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a Wild Call proc should be triggered for the Beast Mastery hunter.
  description: The CheckWildCallProc method evaluates whether the conditions for triggering
    a Wild Call proc are met for a Beast Mastery hunter. This method is typically
    invoked during combat events such as spell casts or attacks to determine if the
    hunter's pet should receive a proc effect from the Wild Call ability. It checks
    various internal states and cooldowns related to the hunter's pet and the Wild
    Call talent, ensuring that procs are applied correctly according to game mechanics
    and balance rules. The method does not directly modify any state but rather performs
    conditional logic to determine if further action is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat event
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler() {\n    hunter->CheckWildCallProc();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI logic for Beast Mastery hunters and
    should not be called directly from external systems unless simulating combat events.
    It relies on the hunter's current pet state and talent configuration to make decisions.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of appropriate combat contexts as it may
    lead to incorrect behavior or performance issues due to unnecessary checks.
