  class: WorldObjectSpellAreaTargetCheck
  method: WorldObjectSpellAreaTargetCheck
  signature: void WorldObjectSpellAreaTargetCheck::WorldObjectSpellAreaTargetCheck(float
    range, const int * position, WorldObject * caster, WorldObject * referer, const
    SpellInfo * spellInfo, SpellTargetCheckTypes selectionType, const int * condList,
    SpellTargetObjectTypes objectType, WorldObjectSpellAreaTargetSearchReason searchReason)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell area target check with specified parameters for validating
    spell targets within a given range.
  description: The WorldObjectSpellAreaTargetCheck constructor initializes a spell
    target validation object that checks whether a given WorldObject meets specific
    criteria to be a valid target for a spell. It defines the search parameters including
    the range, position, caster, referent object, spell information, selection type,
    conditional list, object type, and reason for the search. This mechanism is used
    during spell targeting to ensure only appropriate targets are selected based on
    game rules and conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance within which targets are considered valid for
      the spell. Must be a positive float value representing the radius of the area
      check.
  - name: position
    description: A pointer to an array containing the x, y, z coordinates of the center
      point for the area check. Should contain exactly three elements.
  - name: caster
    description: The WorldObject that is casting the spell. This object's properties
      and state are used in target validation logic.
  - name: referer
    description: A reference WorldObject used to determine context or relative positioning
      for the target check. May be null if not needed.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing details about the spell
      being cast, including targeting rules and restrictions.
  - name: selectionType
    description: An enum value indicating how targets should be selected (e.g., nearest,
      furthest, random). Defines the logic for choosing valid targets from the area.
  - name: condList
    description: Pointer to a list of conditions that must be satisfied by potential
      targets. Each condition is typically an ID or flag used for filtering.
  - name: objectType
    description: Specifies the type of WorldObject to consider as valid targets (e.g.,
      players, creatures, game objects). Used to filter out incompatible object types.
  - name: searchReason
    description: Indicates why this target search is being performed. Helps determine
      appropriate filtering and validation logic based on context (e.g., area effect,
      single target).
  returns: null

      \                     selectionType, condList, objectType, searchReason);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically used internally by the spell system during target
    selection. It does not perform actual target validation but sets up the parameters
    for later evaluation. The constructor itself does not validate inputs; it merely
    stores them for use in subsequent checks.
  warnings: Ensure that all pointers passed to this constructor are valid and initialized
    before calling, as invalid pointers may cause crashes or undefined behavior during
    target validation. The condList array must be properly terminated or have a known
    size to avoid buffer overruns.
