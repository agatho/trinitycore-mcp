documentation:
  brief: Processes internal auction events within the AuctionManager system
  description: The OnEventInternal method serves as the core event handler for the
    AuctionManager class, processing various internal auction-related events such
    as auction creation, cancellation, bidding, and expiration. This method is responsible
    for managing the state transitions of auctions and coordinating with other systems
    like the database and player communication modules. It typically operates within
    the game's main loop or event queue system, ensuring that auction activities are
    properly synchronized with the overall game state. The method handles both incoming
    events from the game engine and internal state changes that affect auction behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The internal event identifier that specifies which type of auction
      event occurred. This integer value corresponds to predefined auction event types
      such as AUCTION_CREATED, AUCTION_CANCELLED, AUCTION_BID_PLACED, or AUCTION_EXPIRED.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Processing an Auction Creation Event
    code: "void AuctionManager::OnEventInternal(const int& event)\n{\n    switch (event)\n\
      \    {\n        case AUCTION_CREATED:\n            // Handle new auction creation\n\
      \            break;\n        case AUCTION_CANCELLED:\n            // Handle\
      \ auction cancellation\n            break;\n        default:\n            //\
      \ Handle unknown events\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's event processing system
    and should not be invoked directly by other components. The method assumes that
    all necessary data structures are properly initialized before execution. Performance
    considerations include avoiding heavy operations within this method to prevent
    blocking the main game loop.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method may cause undefined behavior if the auction
    manager is not properly initialized or if required subsystems are not available.
    This method should only be called from trusted event handling contexts.
