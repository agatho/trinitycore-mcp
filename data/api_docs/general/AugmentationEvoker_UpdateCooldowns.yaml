documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for augmentation abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown states of augmentation evoker abilities within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically called during each update cycle to decrement active cooldown
    timers and reset them when they expire. It ensures that players cannot immediately
    re-use abilities after casting them, maintaining game balance and enforcing proper
    ability usage timing. The method processes all active cooldowns for the evoker's
    augmentation abilities and handles their state transitions from active cooldown
    to ready status.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Cooldowns Call
    code: "void SomeEvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    _augmentationEvoker->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main AI update loop with the time
    delta (diff) parameter representing milliseconds since last update. The implementation
    likely uses internal tracking of cooldown timers and may interact with the player's
    spell cooldown system. Performance-wise, this should be lightweight as it only
    processes active cooldowns rather than all possible abilities.
