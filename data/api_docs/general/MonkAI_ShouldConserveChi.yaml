  class: MonkAI
  method: ShouldConserveChi
  signature: bool MonkAI::ShouldConserveChi()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Monk AI should conserve chi resources during combat.
  description: The ShouldConserveChi method evaluates the current state of the Monk
    AI to decide if it should prioritize conserving chi instead of spending it on
    abilities. This decision is typically based on factors such as available chi points,
    imminent threat levels, and the effectiveness of chi-consuming abilities versus
    alternative actions. The method plays a crucial role in optimizing resource management
    for Monk classes within the TrinityCore framework, particularly for AI-controlled
    monks in scenarios like battlegrounds or scripted encounters where automatic decision-making
    is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should conserve chi, false otherwise. A return value
    of true indicates that the monk's current strategy prioritizes preserving chi
    for more critical abilities or situations, while false suggests that chi can be
    safely spent on active abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Logic
    code: "if (monkAI->ShouldConserveChi()) {\n    // Avoid spending chi on abilities\
      \ like Tiger Palm or Blackout Kick\n    // Instead, focus on defensive maneuvers\
      \ or waiting for better opportunities\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Strategy
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldConserveChi())\
      \ {\n        // Implement chi conservation logic\n        DoNotUseChiSpendingAbilities();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Proceed with normal chi usage\n        UseChiSpendingAbilities();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal state variables such as current
    chi amount, target threat level, and cooldowns of key abilities. It may also consider
    the monk's class specialization (e.g., Brewmaster vs Windwalker) when making decisions
    about chi conservation.
  warnings: Developers should be cautious when relying on this method in custom AI
    implementations, as incorrect logic could lead to inefficient resource usage or
    unexpected behavior during combat. Ensure that all related chi management systems
    are properly synchronized with this decision-making process.
