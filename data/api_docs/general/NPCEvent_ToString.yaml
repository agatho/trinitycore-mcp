  brief: Converts NPC event data into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a textual representation of an NPCEvent
    object, typically used for debugging, logging, or displaying event information
    in a readable format. This method is commonly utilized in TrinityCore's AI and
    event handling systems to serialize event data for monitoring or diagnostic purposes.
    The output format usually includes key event identifiers, types, and relevant
    parameters that help developers understand the nature and context of the NPC event
    without requiring deep inspection of internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the NPCEvent object,
    typically including event type, associated GUIDs, and other identifying characteristics
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'NPCEvent event;

      // ... populate event data ...

      std::string eventString = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("npc.event", "NPC Event occurred: %s", eventString.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Event Handler Context
    code: "void HandleNPCEvent(NPCEvent& event) {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"npc.event\",\
      \ \"Processing event: %s\", event.ToString().c_str());\n    // ... process event\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for development and debugging purposes.
    The exact format of the returned string may vary based on the specific implementation
    of NPCEvent, but it typically includes essential identifying information about
    the event. The method should not be relied upon for critical game logic as its
    primary purpose is informational.
  warnings: The output format of ToString() is not guaranteed to be stable across
    different TrinityCore versions and should not be parsed programmatically in production
    code. Relying on specific string formats may break compatibility when upgrading
    the core.
