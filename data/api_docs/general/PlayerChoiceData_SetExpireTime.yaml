  signature: void PlayerChoiceData::SetExpireTime(int expireTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the expiration time for a player choice dialog.
  description: The SetExpireTime method configures the time at which a player choice
    dialog will expire and become unavailable. This is typically used to manage the
    duration of interactive choices presented to players, ensuring they must make
    selections within a specified timeframe. The method updates an internal timer
    that governs when the choice becomes invalid. This functionality is integral to
    maintaining game flow and preventing stale interactions in dynamic player encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: expireTime
    description: The time value in seconds after which the player choice dialog should
      expire. A value of 0 typically means immediate expiration, while positive values
      indicate a delay before expiration occurs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Expire Time to 30 Seconds
    code: 'PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = new PlayerChoiceData();

      choiceData->SetExpireTime(30); // Choice expires in 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Immediate Expiration
    code: 'PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = new PlayerChoiceData();

      choiceData->SetExpireTime(0); // Choice expires immediately'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal game timer system and may
    affect how the player choice is handled in the UI. Developers should be aware
    that setting a very short expiration time might result in choices not being visible
    to players long enough to make selections.
