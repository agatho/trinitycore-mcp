  class: MechanicDatabase
  method: LoadMechanicData
  signature: void MechanicDatabase::LoadMechanicData()
documentation:
  brief: Loads mechanic-related data from the database into memory for use in game
    mechanics processing.
  description: The LoadMechanicData method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with mechanic definitions stored in the TrinityCore database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that all mechanic-related information, such as spell effects, aura states,
    and movement restrictions, are available for real-time game processing. The method
    retrieves data from relevant database tables and constructs in-memory representations
    that can be efficiently accessed by other subsystems during gameplay. It performs
    necessary validation and error handling to ensure data integrity before making
    the loaded data available to the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'MechanicDatabase mechanicDb;

      mechanicDb.LoadMechanicData();

      // Data is now loaded and ready for use in game mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading mechanic data. It's not thread-safe and should be executed on the main
    thread. The method may block briefly while reading from the database, so it's
    recommended to call it during server startup rather than runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate data entries. Ensure that any existing mechanic data
    is properly cleared before reloading.
