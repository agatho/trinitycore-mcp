  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: StartOperation
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::StartOperation(uint32_t botGuid, MLOperationType
    operation, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Starts tracking performance metrics for a specified bot operation with given
    context.
  description: The StartOperation method initializes performance tracking for a specific
    machine learning operation performed by a bot identified by its GUID. It records
    the beginning of an operation type (such as training or inference) and associates
    it with a contextual description that can be used for debugging or analysis. This
    method is typically called before executing a bot operation to ensure accurate
    timing and resource usage measurements. The tracking mechanism helps in identifying
    bottlenecks and optimizing performance across different operations within the
    ML system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot performing the operation. Must
      be a valid, non-zero GUID representing an active bot instance.
  - name: operation
    description: Type of machine learning operation being started. Should be one of
      the predefined MLOperationType values such as TRAINING, INFERENCE, or EVALUATION.
  - name: context
    description: Descriptive string providing additional context about the operation.
      Can be used for logging, debugging, or categorizing performance data. Should
      not be empty.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      MLOperationType opType = MLOperationType::TRAINING;

      std::string context = "Model training for AI assistant";

      tracker.StartOperation(botGuid, opType, context);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Context
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = playerBot->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      MLOperationType opType = MLOperationType::INFERENCE;

      std::string context = "Inference for spell prediction at level " + std::to_string(playerBot->GetLevel());

      tracker.StartOperation(botGuid, opType, context);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MLPerformanceTracker instance is properly initialized
    and has access to necessary tracking resources. The operation type should match
    predefined constants in MLOperationType enum for correct categorization. Performance
    metrics are typically stored internally and may be flushed or logged upon completion
    of the operation.
  warnings: Calling StartOperation without a valid bot GUID or empty context string
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect tracking data. Ensure that each StartOperation
    call has a corresponding EndOperation call to avoid resource leaks or inaccurate
    timing measurements.
