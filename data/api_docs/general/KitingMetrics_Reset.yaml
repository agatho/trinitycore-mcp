  signature: void KitingMetrics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all kiting metrics to their default values, clearing accumulated data.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal counters and tracking
    variables within the KitingMetrics class. This method is typically invoked when
    starting a new kiting session or when resetting performance statistics. It ensures
    that all previous kiting data is discarded and the metrics are ready for fresh
    measurements. The reset operation affects all tracked values including distance
    traveled, time spent kiting, and any calculated averages or totals.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'KitingMetrics metrics;

      metrics.Reset(); // Clears all kiting data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Before New Session
    code: 'KitingMetrics playerMetrics;

      // ... collect kiting data ...

      playerMetrics.Reset(); // Prepare for next session

      // ... start new kiting session ...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of all internal state variables. It
    should be called before beginning a new kiting analysis to ensure accurate measurements.
    The operation is lightweight and does not involve any external system calls or
    database operations.
