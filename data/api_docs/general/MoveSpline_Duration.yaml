  class: MoveSpline
  method: Duration
  signature: int32 MoveSpline::Duration() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total duration in milliseconds of the movement
    spline.
  description: The Duration method computes the total time required to complete the
    movement defined by this MoveSpline instance. This value represents the cumulative
    duration of all individual segments within the spline, taking into account acceleration,
    deceleration, and any pauses or delays in the movement path. The returned value
    is expressed in milliseconds and can be used for timing-related operations such
    as synchronization with animations, scheduling subsequent actions, or calculating
    movement speed. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's movement system
    to determine how long a creature or player will take to traverse a given path.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the total duration of the movement spline in
    milliseconds. A negative value typically indicates an error or invalid state,
    while zero may indicate no movement is required or the spline has not been initialized
    properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Get Movement Duration
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = player->movespline;\nint32 duration = spline->Duration();\n\
      if (duration > 0)\n{\n    // Use duration for timing operations\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Movement will take %d milliseconds\", duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Duration for Animation Synchronization
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = creature->movespline;\nint32 movementDuration = spline->Duration();\n\
      if (movementDuration > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule an event to occur when movement\
      \ completes\n    creature->AddDelayedEvent(movementDuration, [creature]() {\n\
      \        creature->HandleMovementComplete();\n    });\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on the internal state of the MoveSpline
    and its segments. The duration may vary depending on factors such as movement
    speed modifiers, terrain effects, and whether the spline includes waypoints or
    direct movement. It's important to note that this value is computed at the time
    of calling and may change if the spline is modified afterward.
  warnings: The returned duration value can be zero or negative if the spline has
    not been properly initialized or contains invalid data. Always validate the return
    value before using it in time-sensitive operations to prevent unexpected behavior.
