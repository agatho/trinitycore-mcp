  method: GetDistanceToLeader
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::GetDistanceToLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the current unit and
    its leader in the group.
  description: The GetDistanceToLeader method computes the straight-line distance
    (Euclidean distance) between the AI-controlled unit that owns this behavior and
    the leader of the group it follows. This value is typically used by AI logic to
    determine whether the unit should move closer to or farther from its leader, particularly
    in scenarios involving formation following or maintaining group cohesion. The
    calculation accounts for 3D spatial positioning including height differences.
    This method assumes that a valid leader exists within the context of the behavior;
    otherwise, it may return an undefined or zero distance depending on internal implementation
    details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float representing the Euclidean distance in yards between the unit and
    its leader. Returns 0.0f if no valid leader is present or if the unit and leader
    occupy the same position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check distance for following logic
    code: "if (followerBehavior->GetDistanceToLeader() > 10.0f)\n{\n    // Move towards\
      \ the leader\n    follower->MoveTowards(leader);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance to control movement speed
    code: "float distance = followerBehavior->GetDistanceToLeader();\nif (distance\
      \ > 5.0f)\n{\n    float speed = std::min(distance * 0.5f, 10.0f); // Gradually\
      \ increase speed\n    follower->SetSpeed(speed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning data from the unit and its leader.
    It is recommended to call this method only when both entities are in the same
    map instance to ensure valid results. The returned value includes vertical distance
    (Z-axis), so it reflects true 3D space rather than just horizontal distance.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always implies a meaningful
    distance; if the leader is not properly initialized or has an invalid position,
    the result may be misleading. Also, this method should not be called in high-frequency
    loops without considering performance implications due to potential map and position
    lookups.
