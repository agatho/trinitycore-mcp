  class: InteractionManager
  method: AccessBank
  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::AccessBank(Player * bot, WorldObject
    * banker)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates bank access interaction for a bot player with a banker object.
  description: The AccessBank method handles the process of allowing a bot player
    to interact with a banker object to access their bank. This method typically manages
    the interaction state, validates the player's ability to access the bank, and
    triggers the appropriate UI or game mechanics for bank operations. It is part
    of the InteractionManager's suite of methods that facilitate NPC interactions
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method ensures proper context and state
    management during the bank access sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to access
      the bank.
  - name: banker
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject representing the banker NPC with whom
      the interaction occurs.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the bank
    access attempt. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_TARGET, or
    IN_PROGRESS depending on the implementation and current game state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bank Access
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nWorldObject* banker = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = interactionManager->AccessBank(bot, banker);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    // Bank access granted\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Different Interaction Results
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nWorldObject* banker = ...;\nInteractionResult result\
      \ = interactionManager->AccessBank(bot, banker);\nswitch (result) {\n    case\
      \ InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Proceed with bank operations\n   \
      \     break;\n    case InteractionResult::FAILED:\n        // Handle failure\
      \ case\n        break;\n    case InteractionResult::INVALID_TARGET:\n      \
      \  // Target is not a valid banker\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves state tracking and may require the bot to be
    within a specific range of the banker. It's designed for automated bot behavior
    and should be used in conjunction with other interaction management methods. The
    actual bank UI and functionality are typically handled by the game client or additional
    subsystems.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot player and banker objects are valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method. Improper handling of invalid targets may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method should not be called during
    critical game states where interaction is restricted.
