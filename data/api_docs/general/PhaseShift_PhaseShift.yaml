  brief: Moves the phase shift data from a source object to the current object, effectively
    transferring ownership of the phase shift state.
  description: The PhaseShift::PhaseShift(PhaseShift&& right) method is a move constructor
    that transfers the phase shift state from another PhaseShift object to the current
    instance. This operation is typically used when constructing a new PhaseShift
    object by moving an existing one, avoiding unnecessary copying of phase data.
    The source object 'right' is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move
    operation. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this method supports
    efficient management of phase shifts for players and game objects, particularly
    when handling dynamic phase changes such as zone transitions, instance phases,
    or event-based phase modifications. This move constructor is essential for optimizing
    performance when dealing with temporary or intermediate PhaseShift objects.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'PhaseShift sourcePhase;

      // ... populate sourcePhase with phase data ...

      PhaseShift newPhase = std::move(sourcePhase); // Uses the move constructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Function Parameter
    code: "void ProcessPhase(PhaseShift&& phase) {\n    // Process the moved phase\n\
      \    // sourcePhase is now in a valid but unspecified state\n}\nPhaseShift myPhase;\n\
      ProcessPhase(std::move(myPhase));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an optimized move operation that transfers internal
    resources rather than copying them. The moved-from object should not be used after
    this operation, though it remains in a valid state. In TrinityCore, phase shifts
    are commonly managed through smart pointers or containers where move semantics
    help reduce memory allocations and improve performance during frequent phase changes.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source PhaseShift object should
    not be accessed or used as its state is undefined but still valid. Attempting
    to use the moved-from object may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the
    game logic.
