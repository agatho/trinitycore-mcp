  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: AnalyzeCompetition
  signature: CompetitorAnalysis MarketAnalysis::AnalyzeCompetition(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market competition for a specified item and returns detailed competitor
    analysis data.
  description: The AnalyzeCompetition method performs a comprehensive evaluation of
    the competitive landscape for a given item within the game's economy. It examines
    factors such as pricing trends, supply availability, demand patterns, and player
    behavior related to the specified item. This method is typically used by in-game
    systems or external tools to provide insights into market dynamics. The analysis
    includes data on competing vendors, auction house listings, and potential profit
    margins for traders. The method requires that the item ID be valid and that the
    item exists within the game's database. It may also depend on active market data
    collection processes being enabled.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to analyze for market competition.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  returns: Returns a CompetitorAnalysis object containing detailed metrics about competing
    items, pricing information, supply-demand ratios, and other relevant market data
    for the specified item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "CompetitorAnalysis analysis = marketAnalyzer.AnalyzeCompetition(12345);\n\
      if (analysis.IsValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Competitive pricing: \" << analysis.GetAveragePrice()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Data Processing
    code: "uint32 itemId = 67890;\nCompetitorAnalysis result = marketAnalyzer.AnalyzeCompetition(itemId);\n\
      \n// Process the analysis results\nif (result.GetMarketShare() > 0.5f) {\n \
      \   // Item has strong market presence\n    Log(\"High market competition detected\
      \ for item \" + std::to_string(itemId));\n} else if (result.GetPriceVariance()\
      \ > 1000) {\n    // Significant price fluctuations\n    Log(\"Unstable pricing\
      \ observed for item \" + std::to_string(itemId));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries and potentially time-consuming computations
    depending on the complexity of market data. It should not be called excessively
    in performance-critical sections of code. The returned CompetitorAnalysis object
    is thread-safe for read operations but should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId may result in undefined behavior
    or return empty/invalid analysis data. Ensure that the item exists in the database
    before calling this method. Avoid using this method in high-frequency loops as
    it may impact server performance.
