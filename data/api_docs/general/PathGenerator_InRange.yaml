  signature: bool PathGenerator::InRange(const int & p1, const int & p2, float r,
    float h) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if two points are within a specified range and height difference.
  description: The InRange method determines whether two given points (p1 and p2)
    are within a defined spherical range and vertical height difference. This utility
    function is commonly used in pathfinding and AI logic to evaluate proximity between
    positions. It performs a 3D distance check using Euclidean distance for horizontal
    components and absolute height difference. The method is typically employed by
    the PathGenerator class to validate waypoints or target locations during navigation
    calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: p1
    description: Reference to the first point identifier or index used in path generation
  - name: p2
    description: Reference to the second point identifier or index used in path generation
  - name: r
    description: Maximum allowed horizontal distance (radius) between the two points
  - name: h
    description: Maximum allowed vertical height difference between the two points
  returns: Returns true if both the horizontal distance and vertical height difference
    between the two points are within the specified limits; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic proximity check
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      int pointA = 5;

      int pointB = 10;

      bool isInRange = pathGen.InRange(pointA, pointB, 10.0f, 5.0f);

      // Returns true if points A and B are within 10 units horizontally and 5 units
      vertically'
    language: cpp
  - title: Path validation for AI movement
    code: "if (pathGen.InRange(currentWaypoint, targetPoint, 3.0f, 2.0f)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with movement to target\n    MoveToTarget();\n} else {\n    // Replan\
      \ path or adjust strategy\n    ReplanPath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that p1 and p2 refer to valid indices or identifiers
    within the PathGenerator's internal point structure. The range 'r' represents
    a horizontal radius in world coordinates, while 'h' is the maximum allowed vertical
    difference. Performance is optimized for frequent calls during path evaluation
    but may become expensive if used excessively in tight loops without proper caching.
  warnings: Ensure that p1 and p2 are valid indices before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. The height parameter 'h' should be positive; negative
    values may produce unexpected results. When using this in real-time AI systems,
    consider caching results to prevent redundant calculations.
