documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PerformanceOptimizer instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PerformanceOptimizer class is responsible for
    releasing any memory or system resources that were allocated during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents
    memory leaks when the optimizer object goes out of scope. In the context of TrinityCore,
    this may involve resetting performance monitoring counters, freeing allocated
    buffers, or unregistering from performance tracking systems. The destructor is
    automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object is destroyed, typically
    at the end of its scope or when explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope exit
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;\n    // ...\
      \ perform operations ...\n    // optimizer is automatically destroyed here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of heap-allocated instance
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer* optimizer = new PerformanceOptimizer();

      // ... perform operations ...

      del optimizer; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing heap-allocated
    objects. It is important to ensure that all references to the object are cleared
    before destruction to avoid dangling pointers. The performance optimizer may maintain
    internal state that needs to be properly reset during destruction.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it
    will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that any resources held by the optimizer
    are properly released before the object is destroyed to prevent resource leaks.
