documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the preferred class specializations associated with a given group
    role.
  description: The GetPreferredClassSpecsForRole method returns an integer value representing
    the bitmask of preferred class specializations for a specified group role. This
    functionality is used within TrinityCore's group management and raid assignment
    systems to determine which class specializations are most suitable for fulfilling
    specific roles such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. The returned value typically
    encodes multiple specialization IDs using bit flags, allowing for efficient storage
    and comparison of role preferences across different classes and specs. This method
    is primarily utilized during group creation, raid assignment, and role optimization
    processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask representing the preferred class specializations for
    the specified group role. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific
    class specialization ID, with set bits indicating that the associated specialization
    is preferred for the given role.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Preferred Specs for Tank Role
    code: "int tankSpecs = roleDefinitions.GetPreferredClassSpecsForRole(GroupRole::TANK);\n\
      // Returns bitmask of preferred tanking specs (e.g., Warrior Arms, Paladin Protection)\n\
      if (tankSpecs & (1 << 1)) // Check if Warrior Arms is preferred\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ Warrior Arms specialization logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely uses internal lookup tables or configuration data to map
    group roles to their corresponding preferred class specializations. The returned
    bitmask format suggests that this implementation supports multiple simultaneous
    specializations per role, which is common in TrinityCore's raid management system.
    Developers should be aware that the exact bit positions and values may vary between
    different versions of TrinityCore.
  warnings: The return value represents a bitmask, so bitwise operations must be used
    to extract individual specialization IDs. Incorrect bit manipulation can lead
    to incorrect role assignments or group composition issues. Additionally, this
    method may not account for player-specific preferences or dynamic role changes
    during group activities.
