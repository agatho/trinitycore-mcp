  class: MovementInfo
  method: GetExtraMovementFlags2
  signature: uint32 MovementInfo::GetExtraMovementFlags2() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the second set of extra movement flags from the MovementInfo object.
  description: The GetExtraMovementFlags2 method returns the secondary set of movement
    flags that are used in World of Warcraft's client-server communication protocol.
    These flags typically represent additional movement-related states or behaviors
    beyond the standard movement flags, such as flying, swimming, or other specialized
    movement modes. The returned value is a 32-bit unsigned integer where each bit
    corresponds to a specific movement state. This method is commonly used during
    packet processing and movement validation within TrinityCore's networking and
    movement systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the second set of extra movement flags. Each
    bit in this value corresponds to a specific movement state or behavior as defined
    by the game's movement flag constants.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MovementInfo movementInfo;\n// ... populate movementInfo with data ...\n\
      uint32 extraFlags = movementInfo.GetExtraMovementFlags2();\nif (extraFlags &\
      \ MOVEFLAG2_FLYING)\n{\n    // Handle flying movement state\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Movement Flags
    code: "void DebugMovementInfo(const MovementInfo& info)\n{\n    uint32 flags1\
      \ = info.GetExtraMovementFlags2();\n    printf(\"Extra Movement Flags 2: 0x%08X\\\
      n\", flags1);\n    // Print individual flag states\n    if (flags1 & MOVEFLAG2_FLYING)\
      \ printf(\"Flying\\n\");\n    if (flags1 & MOVEFLAG2_SWIMMING) printf(\"Swimming\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MovementInfo class which is used extensively in
    TrinityCore's movement handling system. The returned flags are typically combined
    with other movement flag sets to fully describe a unit's current movement state.
    The implementation assumes that the MovementInfo object has been properly initialized
    and populated with valid data before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the MovementInfo object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing uninitialized or corrupted movement data
    may lead to undefined behavior. This method should not be called on objects that
    have not been fully constructed or populated with movement data.
