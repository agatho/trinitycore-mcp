documentation:
  brief: Replaces placeholders in a response template with player-specific data
  description: The PersonalizeResponse method processes a response template string
    by substituting placeholder variables with corresponding player data. This method
    is typically used in guild-related communications where standardized messages
    need to be customized for individual players. The method handles various placeholder
    formats and ensures proper data injection while maintaining message integrity.
    It's commonly employed in guild management systems, automated responses, and player
    interaction scripts within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to fetch player-specific data for template substitution.
  - name: responseTemplate
    description: A string containing the response template with placeholders that
      will be replaced with actual player data. Placeholders are typically formatted
      as {player_name}, {guild_rank}, etc.
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the personalized response with all placeholders
    replaced by corresponding player data. If the input is invalid or no player data
    is found, returns an empty string.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      std::string templateStr = "Welcome {player_name} to our guild! Your rank is
      {guild_rank}";

      std::string personalized = guildIntegration->PersonalizeResponse(&playerId,
      templateStr);

      // Returns: "Welcome JohnDoe to our guild! Your rank is Officer"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: 'int* invalidPlayer = nullptr;

      std::string templateStr = "Hello {player_name}";

      std::string result = guildIntegration->PersonalizeResponse(invalidPlayer, templateStr);

      // Returns: empty string due to null pointer'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player data is accessible through the provided GUID.
    The implementation may involve database lookups or cached player information.
    Performance considerations include potential database queries for player data
    retrieval, especially in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior or an empty return value. Ensure that the response template
    contains valid placeholders that correspond to available player data fields.
