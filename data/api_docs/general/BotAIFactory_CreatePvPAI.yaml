  class: BotAIFactory
  method: CreatePvPAI
  signature: int BotAIFactory::CreatePvPAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a PvP AI behavior for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreatePvPAI method is responsible for setting up a PvP (Player
    vs Player) artificial intelligence behavior for a given bot player within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method configures the bot's AI to engage in combat
    scenarios typical of PvP encounters, including targeting, movement, and spell
    usage strategies appropriate for player-versus-player gameplay. The method typically
    involves initializing various AI components such as threat management, ability
    selection, and tactical decision-making systems that are specific to PvP environments.
    It ensures that the bot behaves in a manner consistent with expected PvP player
    behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the PvP
      AI is being created. This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to an
      existing bot player instance.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while negative
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid input parameters,
    insufficient memory, or already initialized AI state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nint result =\
      \ BotAIFactory::CreatePvPAI(myBot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created for the bot\n    printf(\"PvP AI created successfully\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to create PvP AI, error code:\
      \ %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void InitializeBot(Player* bot) {\n  \
      \      int aiResult = BotAIFactory::CreatePvPAI(bot);\n        if (aiResult\
      \ != 0) {\n            // Log error and potentially disable bot\n          \
      \  sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize PvP AI for bot %s\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \            return;\n        }\n        // Proceed with other bot initialization\
      \ steps\n        bot->SetPvP(true);\n        bot->SetInCombat(true);\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's bot AI system and assumes that the
    Player object passed in has been properly initialized as a bot. The method may
    perform internal checks to ensure the player is suitable for PvP AI behavior,
    such as verifying it's not already assigned another AI type. Performance-wise,
    this method should be called during bot initialization or when transitioning between
    different AI modes.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an actual bot instance, not a regular player. Passing a null pointer or a non-bot
    player may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, calling this method
    on a bot that already has an active PvP AI may result in unexpected behavior or
    resource leaks.
