  method: DeactivateBot
  signature: void BotAIActivation::DeactivateBot(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates a specified bot AI instance by setting its active state to false.
  description: The DeactivateBot method is used to disable a specific bot AI instance
    within the TrinityCore framework. This function takes a pointer to an integer
    representing the bot's identifier and sets its activation status to inactive,
    effectively stopping the bot's AI behavior. The method is typically called when
    a bot needs to be temporarily or permanently disabled, such as during player logout,
    server shutdown, or when transitioning between different game states. It ensures
    that the bot stops executing its AI routines and releases any resources it was
    using.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the bot
      to be deactivated. The value pointed to should contain a valid bot GUID or index
      within the system's bot management structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      BotAIActivation::DeactivateBot(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Deactivation
    code: "if (player->HasBot()) {\n    int* botPtr = player->GetBot();\n    BotAIActivation::DeactivateBot(botPtr);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot identifier is valid and corresponds
    to an existing bot instance. The implementation likely involves updating internal
    tracking structures to mark the bot as inactive, which may include stopping AI
    threads or clearing pending actions. It's important to ensure that the pointer
    passed to this function points to a valid memory location containing a proper
    bot ID.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to this method could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the bot identifier is valid before calling
    DeactivateBot, especially if the bot might have already been removed from the
    system.
