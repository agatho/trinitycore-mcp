  method: GetNativeObjectScale
  signature: float Pet::GetNativeObjectScale() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the native scale factor of the pet object.
  description: The GetNativeObjectScale method retrieves the base scale value that
    represents the natural size of the pet in the game world. This scale factor is
    used internally by the TrinityCore engine to determine how the pet should be rendered
    and positioned relative to other objects. The returned value typically corresponds
    to the default scale set during the pet's creation or initialization, and may
    differ from the current visual scale if the pet has been modified through effects
    or spells. This method provides access to the fundamental scaling property that
    underlies the pet's physical representation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the native scale factor of the pet. This is
    typically a positive number, with 1.0f representing normal scale, values less
    than 1.0f indicating smaller size, and values greater than 1.0f indicating larger
    size.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve pet scale
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      float scale = myPet->GetNativeObjectScale();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Pet native scale: %f", scale);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing native and current scale
    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      float nativeScale = myPet->GetNativeObjectScale();

      float currentScale = myPet->GetObjectScale();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Native: %f, Current: %f", nativeScale, currentScale);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the base scale value and does not account for temporary
    modifications such as those caused by spells or effects. The native scale is usually
    set during pet creation and remains constant unless explicitly modified through
    specific game mechanics. This value serves as a reference point for calculating
    visual scaling adjustments.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the original scale factor, not the current
    visual scale. If you need to know how the pet currently appears, use GetObjectScale()
    instead. Modifying the native scale directly may cause unexpected behavior in
    the game world rendering.
