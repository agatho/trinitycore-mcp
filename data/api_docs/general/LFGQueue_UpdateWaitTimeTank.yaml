documentation:
  brief: Updates the wait time for tank roles in the LFG queue for a specific dungeon.
  description: The UpdateWaitTimeTank method is responsible for updating the average
    wait time that players have been queued for tank roles within a specific dungeon.
    This method is part of the LFG (Looking for Group) system in TrinityCore, which
    manages group matching and queue times for various game content such as dungeons,
    raids, and battlegrounds. The method takes a new wait time value and a dungeon
    identifier to update internal tracking data used for queue statistics and player
    experience optimization. It likely affects how long players are informed they've
    been waiting and may influence matchmaking algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: waitTime
    description: The updated average wait time in seconds for tank roles in the LFG
      queue. This value represents how long players have been waiting for a tank role
      in the specified dungeon.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon or instance type. This ID corresponds
      to specific content such as a particular raid, dungeon, or scenario that players
      are queueing for.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update tank wait time for a specific dungeon
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetLFGQueue();

      int32 newWaitTime = 180; // 3 minutes

      uint32 dungeonId = 1234; // Example dungeon ID

      lfgQueue->UpdateWaitTimeTank(newWaitTime, dungeonId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the LFG system when queue statistics
    are recalculated or updated. It may be part of a larger system that tracks and
    displays wait times to players in the UI. The implementation may involve thread-safe
    operations since queue management occurs concurrently with player activities.
