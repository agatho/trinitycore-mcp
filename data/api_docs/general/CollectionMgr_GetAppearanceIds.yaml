  class: CollectionMgr
  method: GetAppearanceIds
  signature: int CollectionMgr::GetAppearanceIds() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of appearance IDs available in the collection
    manager.
  description: The GetAppearanceIds method returns an integer representing the count
    of appearance IDs stored within the CollectionMgr instance. This method is typically
    used to determine how many visual appearances (such as cosmetic items, mounts,
    pets, etc.) are available for a player or in the global collection. It does not
    return the actual appearance IDs themselves but rather provides a count that can
    be used for iteration or validation purposes. The method is read-only and does
    not modify any internal state of the CollectionMgr.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of appearance IDs in the
    collection. Returns zero if no appearances are registered or if the collection
    is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Appearance Count
    code: "int appearanceCount = sCollectionMgr->GetAppearanceIds();\nif (appearanceCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"server.loading\", \"Loaded %d appearance IDs.\"\
      , appearanceCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple count operation and is generally fast. However,
    the actual number of appearance IDs may vary depending on the game version, expansion
    content, and whether player-specific data has been loaded.
