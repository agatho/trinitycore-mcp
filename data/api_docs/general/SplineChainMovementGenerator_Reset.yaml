  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void SplineChainMovementGenerator::Reset(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the spline chain movement generator to its initial state, clearing
    any active spline paths and preparing for new movement sequences.
  description: The Reset method in SplineChainMovementGenerator is responsible for
    cleaning up and reinitializing the movement generator's internal state. It typically
    clears any existing spline paths or movement data that may have been set during
    previous movement operations. This method ensures that the movement generator
    starts fresh, allowing new spline chain sequences to be initiated without interference
    from prior movement states. The reset operation is commonly invoked when transitioning
    between different movement behaviors or when a unit's movement needs to be interrupted
    and restarted.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that owns this movement generator. This
      parameter specifies which unit's movement state will be reset.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'Unit* targetUnit = ...;

      SplineChainMovementGenerator* movementGen = new SplineChainMovementGenerator();

      movementGen->Reset(targetUnit);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset During Movement Transition
    code: "void OnMovementInterrupted(Unit* unit)\n{\n    if (unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == SPLINE_CHAIN_MOTION_TYPE)\n    {\n        SplineChainMovementGenerator*\
      \ gen = static_cast<SplineChainMovementGenerator*>(\n            unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      \        gen->Reset(unit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on movement generators that are currently
    not actively executing movement. Calling Reset during active movement may result
    in undefined behavior or incomplete cleanup of internal data structures.
  warnings: Do not call Reset on a movement generator that is currently in the middle
    of executing a spline chain sequence, as this can lead to memory corruption or
    inconsistent movement state. Always ensure the movement generator is in an idle
    or stopped state before invoking Reset.
