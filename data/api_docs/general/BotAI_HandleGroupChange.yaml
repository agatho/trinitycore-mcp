  brief: Handles group change events for bot AI, updating group membership and related
    behaviors.
  description: The HandleGroupChange method in the BotAI class is responsible for
    managing changes to a bot's group membership within the World of Warcraft environment.
    This method ensures that when a bot joins or leaves a group, all relevant AI behaviors,
    targeting logic, and coordination mechanisms are properly updated. It typically
    handles synchronization of group-related data such as group leader status, shared
    loot settings, and tactical positioning. The method may also trigger updates to
    the bot's behavior state machine to reflect its new group context.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n    HandleGroupChange();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked whenever group membership changes occur. It may internally check for group
    validity and ensure that bot behavior adapts to new group dynamics.
