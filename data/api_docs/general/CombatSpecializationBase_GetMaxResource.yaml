  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetMaxResource
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetMaxResource() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum resource value for the combat specialization.
  description: The GetMaxResource method retrieves the upper limit of the resource
    associated with a specific combat specialization. This value typically represents
    the maximum amount of mana, rage, energy, or other resource type that a player
    or creature can possess while using this specialization. The returned value is
    used in various game mechanics such as resource regeneration calculations, ability
    cost validation, and UI display of resource bars. This method is commonly called
    during combat state updates and resource management operations to ensure accurate
    tracking of available resources within the context of the current specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum resource amount that can be held
    for this combat specialization. This value is typically used as a cap in resource
    calculations and UI rendering.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Max Resource
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      uint32 maxResource = spec->GetMaxResource();

      printf("Maximum resource: %u\n", maxResource);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Max Resource in Resource Management
    code: "uint32 currentResource = player->GetPower(POWER_MANA);\nuint32 maxResource\
      \ = spec->GetMaxResource();\nif (currentResource >= maxResource)\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle resource overflow or full state\n    player->SetPower(POWER_MANA, maxResource);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during combat updates and
    should ideally have minimal performance overhead. The returned value may vary
    depending on the specialization class, level, and any applicable buffs or debuffs
    that modify resource capacity.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatSpecializationBase object is valid before calling
    this method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    This method does not account for temporary modifications to resource limits from
    effects like talents or items; it returns the base maximum value.
