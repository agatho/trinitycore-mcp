documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the map associated with this terrain info instance
  description: The GetMapName method retrieves the human-readable name of the map
    that the TerrainInfo object represents. This is typically used in World of Warcraft
    server-side code to identify maps by their display names rather than internal
    identifiers. The returned string is managed internally by the system and should
    not be modified or freed by callers. The method is thread-safe and can be called
    from any context where a valid TerrainInfo instance exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: A null-terminated C-string containing the display name of the map, or nullptr
    if the terrain info instance is invalid or the map name cannot be determined
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve map name
    code: "TerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo(mapId, x, y);\nif (terrain)\n\
      {\n    const char* mapName = terrain->GetMapName();\n    if (mapName)\n    {\n\
      \        printf(\"Current map: %s\\n\", mapName);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using map name in player communication
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nTerrainInfo* terrain = sTerrainMgr->GetTerrainInfo(player->GetMapId(),\
      \ player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY());\nif (terrain && terrain->GetMapName())\n\
      {\n    player->SendNotification(\"You are currently in %s\", terrain->GetMapName());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string pointer is valid only for the lifetime of the TerrainInfo
    object. Do not cache or store the returned pointer beyond the scope of the current
    function call unless you are certain about the object's lifetime. This method
    may return nullptr if the map data is not loaded or if there's an internal error
    in retrieving the name.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null TerrainInfo pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the TerrainInfo instance is valid before calling
    GetMapName(). The returned string should never be modified or freed by the caller
    as it's managed internally by the system.
