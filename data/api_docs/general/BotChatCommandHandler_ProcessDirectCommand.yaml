  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: ProcessDirectCommand
  signature: CommandResult BotChatCommandHandler::ProcessDirectCommand(const CommandContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a direct chat command issued by a player in the World of Warcraft
    client.
  description: The ProcessDirectCommand method handles incoming chat commands from
    players within the TrinityCore server environment. It interprets the command context,
    validates the command syntax and permissions, and executes the appropriate action
    or returns an error result. This method is typically invoked when a player types
    a command in the chat window, such as '/help' or '/teleport'. The method ensures
    proper command routing and maintains game state consistency by validating inputs
    before execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a CommandResult enum value indicating whether the command was processed
    successfully, encountered an error, or requires further handling. Possible values
    may include COMMAND_OK for successful execution, COMMAND_ERROR for invalid syntax
    or permissions, and COMMAND_NOT_FOUND if the command does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Processing
    code: "CommandResult result = chatHandler->ProcessDirectCommand(context);\nif\
      \ (result == COMMAND_OK)\n{\n    // Command executed successfully\n    ChatHandler::SendSysMessage(session,\
      \ \"Command executed successfully.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's command system and integrates with
    the existing chat handler infrastructure. It relies on proper initialization of
    the CommandContext object containing the player session, command string, and other
    relevant data. The method may perform database lookups or network operations depending
    on the command being processed.
  warnings: Improperly formatted CommandContext objects can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the context contains valid session information
    before calling this method. Be cautious when implementing custom commands as they
    must properly handle all possible input variations and edge cases.
