documentation:
  brief: Sets the flag for a specific bag slot in the player's inventory.
  description: The SetBagSlotFlag method allows developers to modify or set flags
    on a specific bag slot within the player's inventory. This method is typically
    used to control access permissions or special properties of bag slots, such as
    whether they are locked, can be opened, or have other special characteristics.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other inventory management methods to
    ensure proper handling of items and bags during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bagIndex
    description: The index of the bag slot to modify, typically ranging from 0 to
      35 (inclusive). This represents the position within the player's bag inventory.
  - name: flags
    description: The flags to set on the specified bag slot. These can include various
      combinations of lock flags, open flags, or other special properties depending
      on the context and game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Bag Slot Flag
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetBagSlotFlag(0, 1); // Set flag for bag slot 0 to 1 (e.g., lock)

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal inventory system and should only be used
    when necessary. It directly affects how bags are handled in-game, particularly
    in relation to item management and access control.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect behavior in bag handling
    or even game crashes if flags are set incorrectly. Always ensure that the bagIndex
    is within valid bounds before calling this method.
