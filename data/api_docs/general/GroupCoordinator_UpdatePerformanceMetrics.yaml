  brief: Updates performance metrics for the group coordinator.
  description: The UpdatePerformanceMetrics method collects and processes various
    performance-related data points for the GroupCoordinator instance. This includes
    tracking group member activity, processing latency, and resource utilization within
    the group management system. The method is typically invoked periodically to maintain
    up-to-date performance statistics that can be used for optimization, debugging,
    or monitoring purposes. It ensures that the coordinator maintains accurate metrics
    for group operations such as member synchronization, loot distribution, and communication
    overhead.
