  method: VendorListReceived
  signature: NPCEvent NPCEvent::VendorListReceived(int playerGuid, int npcGuid, uint32
    vendorEntry, int items)
documentation:
  brief: Handles vendor list received event for an NPC interaction with a player
  description: The VendorListReceived method is triggered when a player interacts
    with an NPC vendor and the vendor's item list is successfully retrieved. This
    method processes the vendor entry data and associated items, typically used in
    quest progression or merchant interactions within the World of Warcraft game environment.
    It serves as part of the event handling system for NPC vendor transactions, allowing
    scripts and AI behaviors to respond to successful vendor list retrieval events.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player interacting with the vendor
      NPC
  - name: npcGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC vendor being interacted with
  - name: vendorEntry
    description: The database entry ID of the vendor, used to identify specific vendor
      types in the game world
  - name: items
    description: Pointer or reference to the list of items available from the vendor,
      typically containing item data structures
  returns: Returns an NPCEvent object representing the processed vendor list received
    event, which can be used for further event handling or chaining

  - title: Basic Vendor List Received Handling
    code: "void HandleVendorListReceived(NPCEvent event) {\n    int playerGuid = event.GetPlayerGuid();\n\
      \    int npcGuid = event.GetNpcGuid();\n    uint32 vendorEntry = event.GetVendorEntry();\n\
      \    \n    // Process the vendor list\n    if (event.VendorListReceived(playerGuid,\
      \ npcGuid, vendorEntry, items)) {\n        // Vendor list successfully processed\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Vendor list received for player %d\", playerGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Vendor List Processing with Item Validation
    code: "NPCEvent ProcessVendorInteraction(int playerGuid, int npcGuid, uint32 vendorEntry)\
      \ {\n    // Retrieve vendor items\n    std::vector<VendorItem> vendorItems =\
      \ GetVendorItems(vendorEntry);\n    \n    // Validate items before processing\n\
      \    for (auto& item : vendorItems) {\n        if (!item.IsValid()) {\n    \
      \        sLog->outError(\"Invalid vendor item found: %u\", item.GetItemId());\n\
      \            continue;\n        }\n        \n        // Process valid items\n\
      \        HandleVendorItem(playerGuid, npcGuid, item);\n    }\n    \n    // Trigger\
      \ vendor list received event\n    return NPCEvent::VendorListReceived(playerGuid,\
      \ npcGuid, vendorEntry, &vendorItems);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the game's internal event system
    when a player opens a vendor interface. The items parameter may be a pointer to
    a container of vendor item data structures that contain information about available
    products, prices, and availability. Implementation should handle potential null
    or invalid item data gracefully.
  warnings: Ensure proper validation of the items parameter before processing, as
    malformed vendor item data can cause crashes or unexpected behavior. The method
    assumes valid GUIDs and vendor entries; invalid inputs may lead to undefined behavior
    or failed event handling.
