  method: HasCrowdControl
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::HasCrowdControl() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the current behavior manager has any active crowd control effects
    applied.
  description: The HasCrowdControl method determines whether the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    instance currently has any crowd control effects active on the associated unit.
    This method is typically used within AI logic to make decisions based on the unit's
    current state, such as whether it can perform certain actions or should enter
    a specific behavior mode. Crowd control effects include stuns, fears, snares,
    and other mechanics that restrict movement or action. The method evaluates the
    internal state of the behavior manager and returns true if any such effects are
    present, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit managed by this behavior manager currently has
    active crowd control effects applied; returns false if no crowd control effects
    are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (behaviorManager.HasCrowdControl())\n{\n    // Unit is under crowd control,\
      \ avoid aggressive actions\n    unit->GetAI()->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on Crowd Control State
    code: "if (!behaviorManager.HasCrowdControl())\n{\n    // Only allow normal combat\
      \ behavior when not under crowd control\n    if (unit->GetVictim())\n      \
      \  unit->Attack(unit->GetVictim(), true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Maintain defensive\
      \ stance while under crowd control\n    unit->GetAI()->DoFleeToGetAssistance();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of active crowd control effects.
    It should be called frequently in AI update loops to ensure accurate state detection.
    The implementation may consider various Auras and debuffs that are classified
    as crowd control effects within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: The method only reflects the current state at the time of invocation.
    If crowd control status changes between calls, the result may be outdated. Ensure
    proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
