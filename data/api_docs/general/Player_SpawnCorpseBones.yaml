documentation:
  brief: Creates and spawns the player's corpse bones upon death, optionally saving
    the character state.
  description: The SpawnCorpseBones method is responsible for creating and spawning
    the physical corpse bones of a player when they die. This method handles the game
    mechanics related to corpse generation, including setting up the corpse's position,
    orientation, and associated data such as inventory items and equipment. The optional
    triggerSave parameter determines whether the character's state should be saved
    to the database immediately after the corpse is spawned. This method is typically
    invoked internally by the game engine during player death processing and is crucial
    for maintaining proper game state and allowing players to recover their bodies
    later.
  parameters:
  - name: triggerSave
    description: When true, triggers an immediate save of the character's state to
      the database. When false, only creates the corpse bones without saving.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse spawning with save
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SpawnCorpseBones(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Corpse spawning without immediate save
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SpawnCorpseBones(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the game engine during player
    death processing. The actual corpse creation involves setting up a GameObject
    of type GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CORPSE, which stores the player's appearance and inventory
    data. The triggerSave parameter affects whether the character's state is persisted
    immediately or deferred to a later save cycle.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless you
    understand the full implications of corpse creation and database persistence.
    Improper use may lead to inconsistent game state or database corruption. The method
    assumes the player is in a valid death state and will not handle cases where the
    player is still alive.
