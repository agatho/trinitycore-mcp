  class: MaelstromResource
  method: ConsumeMaelstromWeapon
  signature: bool MaelstromResource::ConsumeMaelstromWeapon(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes Maelstrom weapon resource stacks and returns true if successful.
  description: The ConsumeMaelstromWeapon method reduces the current stack count of
    the Maelstrom weapon resource by the specified amount. This method is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage the consumption of Maelstrom
    resources, which are often associated with abilities like Maelstrom Weapon proc
    effects. The method checks if sufficient stacks are available before consuming
    them and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the operation. It
    is commonly invoked when a player's weapon procs or when certain abilities consume
    resource stacks.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of Maelstrom weapon resource stacks to consume from the
      current total. Must be a positive integer value representing the desired stack
      reduction.
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of stacks were successfully consumed,
    or false if there were insufficient stacks available to fulfill the request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to consume one Maelstrom stack
    code: "if (player->GetMaelstromResource()->ConsumeMaelstromWeapon(1)) {\n    //\
      \ Successfully consumed one stack\n    // Proceed with ability activation or\
      \ effect application\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming multiple stacks for a powerful ability
    code: "uint32 requiredStacks = 5;\nif (player->GetMaelstromResource()->ConsumeMaelstromWeapon(requiredStacks))\
      \ {\n    // Apply the powerful ability effect\n    player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ 123456, true); // Example spell\n} else {\n    // Not enough stacks - notify\
      \ player or prevent ability usage\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough\
      \ Maelstrom energy.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MaelstromResource class which manages the resource
    tracking for Maelstrom Weapon effects. The implementation likely involves atomic
    operations or locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during concurrent access.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly cast spells or apply
    effects - it only handles the resource consumption aspect.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking the current stack count may result
    in unexpected behavior if insufficient stacks are available. Always verify the
    current resource level before attempting to consume a specific number of stacks,
    especially when dealing with abilities that require multiple stacks.
