  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordHealingDone
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordHealingDone(int * target, int amount, int overheal)
documentation:
  brief: Records healing done by a Monk AI to track performance metrics and overhealing
    statistics.
  description: The RecordHealingDone method is used within the MonkAI class to log
    information about healing actions performed by a monk character. This method tracks
    both the amount of healing applied and any overhealing that occurred, which is
    essential for performance analysis, combat simulation, and maintaining accurate
    combat logs in TrinityCore. The method updates internal tracking structures to
    maintain statistics on effective healing and overheal amounts for the monk's AI
    behavior. It does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but serves as a data
    collection utility for monitoring and reporting.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that received the healing. This parameter
      represents the unit being healed and is used to associate the healing event
      with a specific target in tracking systems.
  - name: amount
    description: The total amount of healing applied to the target. This value represents
      the raw healing points delivered during the healing action.
  - name: overheal
    description: The amount of healing that exceeded the target's maximum health,
      representing overhealing. This value is used to track wasted healing and calculate
      efficiency metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Record
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      int healAmount = 500;

      int overhealAmount = 100;

      monkAI->RecordHealingDone(&target, healAmount, overhealAmount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Healing Efficiency
    code: "void MonkAI::OnHeal(Unit* target, int baseHeal, int overheal) {\n    int\
      \ effectiveHeal = baseHeal - overheal;\n    RecordHealingDone(&target, baseHeal,\
      \ overheal);\n    // Additional logic to analyze healing efficiency\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the MonkAI system when processing
    healing events. The target parameter should be a valid pointer to a Unit object;
    otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The method assumes that all parameters
    are properly validated before being passed in.
  warnings: Passing null or invalid pointers for the target parameter can lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the amount and overheal values are
    non-negative integers representing actual healing points.
