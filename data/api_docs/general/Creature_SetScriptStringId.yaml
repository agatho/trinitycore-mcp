  class: Creature
  method: SetScriptStringId
  signature: void Creature::SetScriptStringId(std::string id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the script string identifier for a creature, allowing for custom scripting
    and identification within the game world.
  description: This method assigns a unique string identifier to a Creature object,
    which is used for script identification and retrieval within the TrinityCore framework.
    The string ID serves as a key for accessing specific creature behaviors or scripts
    in the database, enabling developers to create custom AI behaviors or modify existing
    creature scripts without altering the core game mechanics. This method is typically
    used during creature initialization or when setting up custom script configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The string identifier to assign to the creature. This should be a
      unique, non-empty string that can be used to reference the creature's script
      in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script ID Assignment
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetScriptStringId("custom_script_12345");'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other creature scripting
    methods and should be called during creature initialization or when setting up
    custom behavior. This method does not directly affect the creature's AI behavior
    but rather provides a way to identify and retrieve specific scripts.
  warnings: Improper use of script string IDs can lead to conflicts in database queries,
    especially if duplicate IDs are assigned to different creatures. Care should be
    taken to ensure unique identifiers when using this method.
