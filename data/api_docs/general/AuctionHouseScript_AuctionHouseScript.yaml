  class: AuctionHouseScript
  method: AuctionHouseScript
  signature: void AuctionHouseScript::AuctionHouseScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AuctionHouseScript instance with the specified name.
  description: The AuctionHouseScript constructor initializes a new auction house
    script instance with the provided name. This method is typically used to register
    custom auction house behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The name parameter
    serves as a unique identifier for the script, allowing the game server to distinguish
    between different auction house implementations. When called, this constructor
    sets up the internal state of the script object and prepares it for integration
    with the auction house system. This is an essential part of extending or modifying
    default auction house functionality in TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that serves as the unique identifier for
      this AuctionHouseScript instance. This name is used by the server to register
      and retrieve the script implementation within the auction house system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AuctionHouseScript Initialization
    code: "class MyAuctionHouseScript : public AuctionHouseScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  MyAuctionHouseScript() : AuctionHouseScript(\"MyCustomAuctionHouse\")\n \
      \   {\n        // Custom initialization code here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object construction, typically
    within a class that inherits from AuctionHouseScript. The name parameter must
    be a valid null-terminated C-string and should be unique among all registered
    auction house scripts to prevent conflicts.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on already initialized objects as
    it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure the name parameter is properly null-terminated
    to avoid memory corruption issues.
