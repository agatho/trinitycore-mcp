  signature: bool FriendlyCCedInRange::operator()(int * u) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a friendly unit is within range and affected by crowd control.
  description: The operator() method evaluates whether a friendly unit is within a
    specified range and currently under the effects of a crowd control (CC) ability.
    This function is typically used in AI decision-making logic to determine if it's
    safe or appropriate to perform actions on nearby friendly units that are already
    incapacitated by CC effects. The method takes an integer pointer as input which
    likely represents a unit identifier or index, and returns true if the conditions
    are met, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: u
    description: Pointer to an integer representing a unit identifier or index. This
      parameter is used to reference a specific friendly unit in the game world for
      evaluation.
  returns: 'Returns true if the specified friendly unit is within range and affected
    by crowd control, otherwise false. A return value of true indicates that the unit
    meets both criteria: proximity and CC status.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (FriendlyCCedInRange()(unitIndex)) {\n    // Perform action on friendly\
      \ unit under CC\n    DoSomethingWithCCedUnit();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI behavior system
    code: "class MyAI : public UnitAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI() override {\n\
      \        if (FriendlyCCedInRange()(targetUnit)) {\n            // Safe to assist\
      \ CCed ally\n            return AssistAlly();\n        }\n        return false;\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI framework in TrinityCore where
    unit states and proximity are evaluated. The implementation may involve checking
    the unit's current CC status through the game's spell system and verifying spatial
    distance using internal range calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer pointer 'u' points to a valid friendly unit, otherwise
    behavior is undefined. This method should not be called on hostile units as it
    assumes a friendly context.
