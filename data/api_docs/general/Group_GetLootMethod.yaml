  class: Group
  method: GetLootMethod
  signature: LootMethod Group::GetLootMethod() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot distribution method currently set for the group.
  description: The GetLootMethod function returns the current loot distribution method
    used by the group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, groups can use different
    loot rules such as free-for-all, round-robin, master loot, or need-before-greed.
    This method allows scripts and systems to determine how loot is distributed among
    group members. The returned LootMethod enum value indicates which distribution
    style is active for the group. This function does not modify any state and is
    purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A LootMethod enum value representing the current loot distribution method
    of the group. Possible values include: LOOT_METHOD_FREEFORALL, LOOT_METHOD_ROUNDROBIN,
    LOOT_METHOD_MASTERLOOT, LOOT_METHOD_NEEDBEFOREGREED, and others defined in the
    TrinityCore loot system.'
  examples:
  - title: Check current loot method
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    LootMethod method\
      \ = group->GetLootMethod();\n    switch (method)\n    {\n        case LOOT_METHOD_FREEFORALL:\n\
      \            // Handle free-for-all loot\n            break;\n        case LOOT_METHOD_MASTERLOOT:\n\
      \            // Handle master loot\n            break;\n        default:\n \
      \           // Handle other methods\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. It returns
    immediately without performing expensive operations. The returned value reflects
    the group's current loot settings, which may change during gameplay when a player
    modifies the group's loot rules.
