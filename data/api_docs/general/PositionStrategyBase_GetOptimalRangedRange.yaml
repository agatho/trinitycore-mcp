  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: GetOptimalRangedRange
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::GetOptimalRangedRange()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal ranged attack distance for a unit based
    on its positioning strategy.
  description: The GetOptimalRangedRange method determines the ideal distance at which
    a unit should engage in ranged combat, taking into account factors such as weapon
    range, movement capabilities, and tactical positioning. This value is typically
    used by AI systems to decide when to initiate or maintain ranged attacks. The
    method considers the unit's current state, including whether it is moving, attacking,
    or under threat, to compute an appropriate engagement range that maximizes effectiveness
    while minimizing vulnerability. It serves as a core component in determining combat
    behavior for ranged units within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal ranged attack distance in
    yards. This value is typically positive and indicates the preferred distance at
    which a unit should maintain to perform effective ranged attacks, or zero if no
    valid range can be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float optimalRange = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetStrategy()->GetOptimalRangedRange();\n\
      if (optimalRange > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the calculated range for positioning\
      \ logic\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"Optimal ranged range: {} yards\", optimalRange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI decision-making processes and may be
    called frequently during combat updates. The returned value should not be directly
    used as a fixed distance for movement, but rather as a reference point for positioning
    calculations. Implementation details may vary depending on the specific PositionStrategyBase
    subclass being used.
  warnings: The method assumes that the unit has valid positioning data and that it
    is in an appropriate combat state. Calling this method on units that are not engaged
    in combat or have invalid movement states may result in unexpected behavior or
    incorrect range calculations.
