  class: ArenaAI
  method: MoveToPillar
  signature: bool ArenaAI::MoveToPillar(int * player, const ArenaPillar & pillar)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the AI-controlled player to a specified arena pillar position.
  description: The MoveToPillar method instructs an ArenaAI-controlled player to navigate
    to a designated arena pillar location. This functionality is typically used during
    arena matches to position players at strategic locations, such as for battleground
    objectives or specific tactical placements. The method utilizes the provided pillar
    data to calculate movement path and execute the motion. It returns true if the
    movement initiation was successful, otherwise false. The player parameter likely
    represents a reference to the controlled unit, while the pillar defines the target
    location within the arena environment.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the arena context. This value is used to identify which specific player
      entity should perform the movement action.
  - name: pillar
    description: Reference to an ArenaPillar object containing the coordinates and
      properties of the target pillar position in the arena. This structure defines
      where the player should move to during gameplay.
  returns: Returns true if the movement command was successfully initiated for the
    specified player toward the given pillar location; otherwise returns false, which
    may indicate failure due to invalid parameters, pathfinding issues, or unit state
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement to Pillar
    code: "int playerId = 1;\nArenaPillar targetPillar;\ntargetPillar.x = 100.0f;\n\
      targetPillar.y = 200.0f;\ntargetPillar.z = 50.0f;\nbool success = arenaAI->MoveToPillar(&playerId,\
      \ targetPillar);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Movement initiated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Movement Based on Pillar Type
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nArenaPillar centerPillar;\ncenterPillar.x = 0.0f;\n\
      centerPillar.y = 0.0f;\ncenterPillar.z = 0.0f;\nif (arenaAI->MoveToPillar(&playerId,\
      \ centerPillar))\n{\n    // Proceed with next AI action after successful movement\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the arena AI system and assumes that the player entity
    has valid movement capabilities. The ArenaPillar structure should contain proper
    coordinate values for accurate positioning. Movement behavior may depend on the
    current state of the arena match and player unit status.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active unit before
    calling this method. Invalid pillar data or uninitialized variables could lead
    to undefined behavior or failed movement attempts.
