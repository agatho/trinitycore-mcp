  signature: void WarriorAI::ManageAdvancedThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Manages advanced threat generation and handling for warrior AI behavior.
  description: The ManageAdvancedThreat method is responsible for controlling how
    a warrior AI generates, maintains, and responds to threat levels within the game
    environment. This includes calculating threat based on melee attacks, abilities,
    and defensive actions, as well as managing the AI's targeting behavior in relation
    to threat distribution. The method ensures that the warrior maintains appropriate
    threat levels to keep aggro on the primary target while avoiding unnecessary threat
    spikes that could cause the AI to switch targets unexpectedly. It integrates with
    the core threat system to ensure proper combat flow and adherence to class-specific
    mechanics such as taunts, rage generation, and ability usage based on threat conditions.

  - title: Basic Threat Management Call
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        warriorAI->ManageAdvancedThreat();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked only when the AI is in combat. It relies on internal threat tracking mechanisms
    and may interact with other AI subsystems such as target selection and ability
    casting.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of combat or without proper
    AI state management can lead to inconsistent threat behavior and potential target
    switching issues. The method assumes that the AI's current target is valid and
    that threat calculations are properly initialized.
