documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one BotSessionManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for BotSessionManager performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source object to the destination object. This
    method ensures that any session data, configuration settings, and internal state
    information are properly transferred. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system,
    this operation is crucial when duplicating or reassigning bot session configurations.
    The operator handles memory management internally to prevent resource leaks and
    ensures that both objects remain in a consistent state after assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotSessionManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current BotSessionManager object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSessionManager manager1;

      BotSessionManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // or

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'BotSessionManager manager1, manager2, manager3;

      manager1 = manager2 = manager3; // Chained assignment

      // All three managers now contain the same session data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements a deep copy strategy to ensure that internal
    pointers and dynamically allocated memory are properly duplicated. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded environments, though this depends
    on the specific implementation details of the BotSessionManager class.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large BotSessionManager objects as it may cause
    performance overhead due to deep copying. Also ensure that no circular references
    exist in the internal data structures to prevent memory leaks or infinite loops
    during assignment.
