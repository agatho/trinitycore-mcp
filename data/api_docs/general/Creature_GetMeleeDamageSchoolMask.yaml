  brief: Returns the school mask of the creature's melee damage
  description: This method retrieves the school mask associated with the creature's
    melee attack damage. It is used to determine the damage type of the creature's
    physical attacks, which affects how damage is calculated and applied in combat.
    The method returns an integer representing the damage school mask, typically corresponding
    to one of the standard damage types such as physical, holy, fire, frost, nature,
    shadow, or arcane. This information is crucial for understanding how the creature
    interacts with resistances and damage reduction mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the school mask of the melee damage. The
    value corresponds to standard damage types like physical (0), holy (1), fire (2),
    frost (3), nature (4), shadow (5), or arcane (6). If no valid damage type is found,
    it may return 0 or a negative value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      int damageType = creature->GetMeleeDamageSchoolMask(0);

      // Returns the school mask for melee damage

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related functions
    to determine how damage is processed. It may be affected by buffs or debuff states,
    and should be used carefully during combat calculations.
  warnings: The method may return invalid values if the creature does not have a valid
    melee attack. Care should be taken when using this method in combat calculations
    as it can affect damage output.
