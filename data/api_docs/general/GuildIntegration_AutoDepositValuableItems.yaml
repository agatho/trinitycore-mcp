  class: GuildIntegration
  method: AutoDepositValuableItems
  signature: void GuildIntegration::AutoDepositValuableItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Deposits valuable items from a player's inventory into the guild bank.
  description: The AutoDepositValuableItems method automatically transfers items of
    significant value from a specified player's inventory to the guild bank. This
    functionality is typically used in guild management systems to ensure that high-value
    loot is safely stored within the guild's shared resources. The method evaluates
    items based on their item level, quality, and other relevant criteria to determine
    whether they should be auto-deposited. It requires a valid player reference to
    operate correctly and may involve checks for guild bank space availability and
    player permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to locate and access the specific player's inventory
      for item evaluation and transfer.
  returns: None. The method performs its operation internally without returning any
    value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildIntegration;

      guildIntegration.AutoDepositValuableItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player exists and has a valid connection to
    the game world. It may perform checks for guild bank capacity and item eligibility
    before depositing items. The implementation might be optimized for performance
    by batching operations or using asynchronous processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an active player
    object; otherwise, the method could cause undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    verify that the player has sufficient permissions to access their inventory and
    that guild bank space is available before invoking this method.
