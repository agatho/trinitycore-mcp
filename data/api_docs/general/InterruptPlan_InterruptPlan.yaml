documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new interrupt plan instance for handling spell interruption
    logic in the game engine.
  description: The InterruptPlan constructor initializes a new instance of the InterruptPlan
    class, setting up internal state for managing spell interruption events. This
    class is typically used within the TrinityCore AI system to define how spells
    should be interrupted under various conditions such as damage taken, movement,
    or other player actions. The constructor prepares the object's data structures
    and default values necessary for spell interruption handling without requiring
    additional parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InterruptPlan instance
    code: 'InterruptPlan plan;

      // The plan is now initialized and ready to be used for spell interruption logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic object state. The actual spell interruption
    behavior is typically handled through other methods in the class that are called
    during gameplay events.
