    std::string & password)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to join a chat channel with an optional password.
  description: The JoinChannel method is used by players to join a specific chat channel
    in the World of Warcraft game. It takes a channel name and an optional password
    as parameters. If the channel requires a password, it must be provided; otherwise,
    an empty string can be passed. The method handles the logic for validating the
    player's ability to join the channel, checking permissions, and managing the player's
    presence in the channel. This function is part of the SocialManager class which
    manages all social interactions within the game including chat channels, friends
    lists, and guild communications.
  parameters:
  - name: channelName
    description: The name of the chat channel to join. Must be a valid channel name
      that exists or can be created by the player.
  - name: password
    description: Optional password required to join a protected channel. If the channel
      does not require a password, an empty string may be passed.
  returns: Returns true if the player successfully joins the channel, false otherwise.
    Failure can occur due to invalid channel name, incorrect password, insufficient
    permissions, or if the player is already in the channel.
  examples:
  - title: Join a public channel
    code: "if (socialManager->JoinChannel(\"General\", \"\")) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ joined the General channel\n    sLog->outString(\"Player joined General channel\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to join the channel\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed\
      \ to join General channel\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Join a password-protected channel
    code: "std::string channelName = \"Trade\";\nstd::string password = \"secret123\"\
      ;\nif (socialManager->JoinChannel(channelName, password)) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player joined Trade channel successfully\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to join Trade channel - incorrect password or access denied\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player issues a /join command in-game.
    The implementation checks for existing channel membership, validates the channel
    name against server rules, and ensures the player has proper permissions to join.
    It also handles internal state updates for the player's social presence.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent channel name will
    result in a failed join attempt. Players must be careful when joining password-protected
    channels as incorrect passwords will prevent access. Repeated failed attempts
    may lead to temporary restrictions on chat functionality.
