  class: KitingManager
  method: EvaluateKitingTriggers
  signature: KitingTrigger KitingManager::EvaluateKitingTriggers(const KitingContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates kiting triggers based on the current kiting context and returns
    the appropriate trigger action.
  description: The EvaluateKitingTriggers method analyzes the provided kiting context
    to determine the most suitable kiting trigger for the current game state. This
    method is typically used in AI-driven kiting behavior systems to decide when and
    how a unit should perform kiting actions such as moving, turning, or adjusting
    speed. It processes various factors like distance to target, threat level, and
    movement constraints within the kiting context to return a KitingTrigger object
    that represents the recommended action. The method assumes that the input context
    has been properly initialized with relevant data before being passed to this function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingTrigger enum value representing the determined kiting action based
    on the evaluation of the provided kiting context. Possible values may include
    actions like KITING_TRIGGER_MOVE, KITING_TRIGGER_TURN, KITING_TRIGGER_SPEED_ADJUST,
    or KITING_TRIGGER_NONE if no trigger is applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'KitingContext context;

      // Initialize context with relevant data

      KitingTrigger trigger = kitingManager.EvaluateKitingTriggers(context);

      // Use the returned trigger to determine next action'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger kiting AI system and relies on accurate input
    from the KitingContext. It's recommended that the context be updated regularly
    with current unit state information for optimal behavior. The implementation may
    involve complex logic to evaluate multiple conditions and should be tested thoroughly
    in various combat scenarios.
