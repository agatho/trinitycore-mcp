  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: InterpolatePosition
  signature: int FollowBehaviorUtils::InterpolatePosition(const int & start, const
    int & end, float factor)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates an interpolated integer position between a start and end value
    based on a given factor.
  description: The InterpolatePosition method performs linear interpolation between
    two integer values, start and end, using a floating-point factor. This is commonly
    used in game AI behaviors to smoothly transition positions or values over time.
    The factor should typically be between 0.0f and 1.0f, where 0.0f returns the start
    value and 1.0f returns the end value. Values outside this range may produce extrapolated
    results. This method is particularly useful in pathfinding, movement smoothing,
    and animation blending within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting integer value for interpolation. This represents the
      initial position or value in the interpolation sequence.
  - name: end
    description: The ending integer value for interpolation. This represents the target
      position or value in the interpolation sequence.
  - name: factor
    description: A floating-point interpolation factor between 0.0f and 1.0f. Values
      closer to 0.0f return values closer to start, while values closer to 1.0f return
      values closer to end. Values outside this range will produce extrapolated results.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the interpolated position between start
    and end based on the provided factor. The result is typically a value between
    start and end (inclusive), or potentially beyond these bounds if the factor is
    outside [0.0f, 1.0f].
  examples:
  - title: Basic interpolation between two positions
    code: int currentPos = FollowBehaviorUtils::InterpolatePosition(10, 50, 0.5f);
      // Returns 30
    language: cpp
  - title: Smooth movement with factor progression
    code: "for (float t = 0.0f; t <= 1.0f; t += 0.1f) {\n    int pos = FollowBehaviorUtils::InterpolatePosition(0,\
      \ 100, t);\n    // Use pos for smooth movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs simple linear interpolation and does not account for
    complex motion paths or acceleration/deceleration. It's designed for straightforward
    numeric interpolation rather than sophisticated AI pathing calculations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using factors outside the [0.0f, 1.0f] range as this
    will produce extrapolated results which may not be desired in all contexts. Ensure
    that start and end values are appropriate for the intended use case to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
