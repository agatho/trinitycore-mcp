  class: Group
  method: Create
  signature: bool Group::Create(Player * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new group with the specified player as the leader
  description: The Group::Create method initializes a new group in the game world,
    designating the provided player as the group leader. This method sets up the necessary
    group structure including member tracking, loot settings, and communication channels.
    The operation is typically invoked when a player forms a new group, either through
    the UI or programmatically. It ensures that all group-related systems are properly
    initialized for the new group instance.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will become the group leader. This
      player must be valid and online in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully created with the specified leader,
    false otherwise. The method may fail if the leader is already in a group or if
    there are system resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Creation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nif (player->GetGroup() ==\
      \ nullptr) {\n    Group* newGroup = new Group();\n    if (newGroup->Create(player))\
      \ {\n        // Group successfully created\n        player->SetGroup(newGroup);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the caller has already allocated memory for the
    Group object. The group leader must be online and valid. The method internally
    handles initialization of group members, permissions, and synchronization with
    the game world state.
  warnings: Do not call this method on a player who is already part of another group.
    This could lead to undefined behavior or group corruption. Always verify that
    the player is not in an existing group before calling Create.
