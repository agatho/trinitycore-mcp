  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::IsCCOnCooldown(int * player, CCType ccType) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a crowd control ability is currently on cooldown for the specified
    player.
  description: The IsCCOnCooldown method determines whether a specific type of crowd
    control effect is currently inactive (on cooldown) for a given player. This method
    is typically used within the PvPCombatAI class to manage and track the availability
    of crowd control abilities during player versus player combat scenarios. It evaluates
    the cooldown status of the specified CC type and returns true if the ability is
    on cooldown, false otherwise. The method relies on internal tracking mechanisms
    to maintain accurate cooldown state information for each player's abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for whom the cooldown status is being
      checked. This parameter must point to a valid Player instance or be null.
  - name: ccType
    description: The type of crowd control effect to check. This should be an enum
      value representing a specific CC ability (e.g., stun, fear, silence). The exact
      values depend on the CCType enumeration defined in the codebase.
  returns: Returns true if the specified crowd control ability is currently on cooldown
    for the player, false if it is available for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (pvpAI->IsCCOnCooldown(player, CC_STUN)) {\n    // Stun is on cooldown,\
      \ cannot use\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with using stun ability"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple CC Types
    code: "bool canUseFear = !pvpAI->IsCCOnCooldown(player, CC_FEAR);\nbool canUseSilence\
      \ = !pvpAI->IsCCOnCooldown(player, CC_SILENCE);\n\nif (canUseFear && canUseSilence)\
      \ {\n    // Both fear and silence are available\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FEAR_AND_SILENCE, true);\n} else if (canUseFear) {\n    // Only fear\
      \ is available\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FEAR, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object passed in is valid and properly
    initialized. The cooldown tracking mechanism may rely on internal timers or game
    state updates that are managed by the AI system. Performance-wise, this check
    should be relatively fast as it only involves a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The CCType parameter must correspond to valid values
    defined in the CCType enumeration; invalid values may lead to unexpected results
    or crashes.
