  signature: void CombatStateAnalyzer::UpdateEnemyMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates combat metrics for enemy targets in the current combat state.
  description: The UpdateEnemyMetrics method is responsible for recalculating and
    refreshing various combat statistics and performance indicators related to enemy
    units within the active combat scenario. This method typically gathers data such
    as damage dealt, healing received, threat levels, and other relevant combat analytics
    for each enemy target. It is commonly invoked during combat updates or when new
    combat events occur to ensure that the analyzer maintains accurate and up-to-date
    information about enemy behavior and performance. The method does not require
    any input parameters and operates on the internal state of the CombatStateAnalyzer
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void MyCombatSystem::OnCombatUpdate()\n{\n    analyzer.UpdateEnemyMetrics();\n\
      \    // Proceed with further combat logic using updated metrics\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during active combat to maintain accurate
    enemy state tracking. It may involve performance overhead if invoked too frequently
    without batching updates. The internal data structures used by this method are
    assumed to be thread-safe in a single-threaded context, but care must be taken
    when using it in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of an active combat context may result in
    invalid or stale metrics being calculated. Ensure that combat state is properly
    initialized before calling this function.
