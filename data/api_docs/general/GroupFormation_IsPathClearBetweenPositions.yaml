  method: IsPathClearBetweenPositions
  signature: bool GroupFormation::IsPathClearBetweenPositions(const int & start, const
    int & end) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a clear path exists between two positions in a group formation.
  description: The IsPathClearBetweenPositions method evaluates whether there is an
    unobstructed line of sight or navigable route between two specified positions
    within a group formation context. This functionality is typically used to ensure
    that group members can move cohesively without collisions or blocked pathways.
    The method likely performs pathfinding checks using internal navigation data structures
    and considers factors such as terrain, obstacles, and group member positioning.
    It returns true if the path is clear and false otherwise, making it essential
    for maintaining proper group movement behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position index or identifier within the group formation.
      This value represents a specific point from which the path check begins.
  - name: end
    description: The ending position index or identifier within the group formation.
      This value represents a specific point to which the path is being checked for
      clearance.
  returns: Returns true if there is a clear, navigable path between the start and
    end positions; otherwise returns false if an obstruction or invalid route exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Clear Check
    code: "if (groupFormation->IsPathClearBetweenPositions(0, 3)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with movement\n    MoveToPosition(3);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative path\
      \ or wait\n    WaitAndRetry();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Formation Path Validation
    code: "bool isValidPath = groupFormation->IsPathClearBetweenPositions(\n    playerGroup->GetMemberPositionIndex(player1),\n\
      \    playerGroup->GetMemberPositionIndex(player2)\n);\nif (isValidPath) {\n\
      \    // Allow players to move together\n    player1->MoveTo(player2->GetPosition());\n\
      } else {\n    // Adjust formation or notify user\n    SendFormationWarning();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal navigation mesh data and may involve
    performance considerations when checking multiple positions. It should be used
    judiciously during group movement operations to avoid excessive computation overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the start and end indices are valid within the current group
    formation; invalid indices may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    This method does not account for dynamic obstacles that might appear between checks.
