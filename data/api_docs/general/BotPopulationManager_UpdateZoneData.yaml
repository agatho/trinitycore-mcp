  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: UpdateZoneData
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::UpdateZoneData(uint32 zoneId, uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates zone data for bot population management based on the provided zone
    and map identifiers.
  description: The UpdateZoneData method is responsible for refreshing or initializing
    zone-specific information within the BotPopulationManager. This function likely
    handles population counts, spawn rates, or other zone-related configurations that
    affect how bots are distributed or behave in specific areas of the game world.
    It takes a zone identifier and a map identifier as inputs to determine which zone's
    data should be updated. The method is typically invoked when a bot enters a new
    zone or when zone-specific settings need to be recalculated. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining realistic bot behavior and population distribution
    across different zones in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which data needs to be updated.
      This value corresponds to the zone ID used internally by TrinityCore's map system.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map containing the specified zone. This
      helps determine the correct context for zone-specific bot population calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update zone data for a specific zone and map
    code: 'BotPopulationManager* manager = BotPopulationManager::Instance();

      manager->UpdateZoneData(1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during bot initialization or when a player enters
    a new zone. It may trigger internal recalculations of bot spawn points, population
    limits, or behavior patterns specific to the given zone and map combination.
