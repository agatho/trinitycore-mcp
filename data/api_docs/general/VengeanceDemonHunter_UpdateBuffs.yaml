documentation:
  brief: Updates the buff states and effects for the Vengeance Demon Hunter class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs, debuffs, and aura effects specific to the Vengeance Demon Hunter
    specialization. This method typically iterates through the player's active auras,
    checks their duration and stacking properties, and applies any necessary updates
    to the character's stats, abilities, or visual effects. It ensures that the Demon
    Hunter maintains proper buff states during combat and non-combat scenarios, including
    handling cooldowns, proc-based effects, and talent-driven enhancements. The method
    is often called internally by the core game loop or in response to specific events
    such as spell casts, damage dealt, or resource changes.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_DEMON_HUNTER)\n\
      \    {\n        VengeanceDemonHunter* dh = static_cast<VengeanceDemonHunter*>(player);\n\
      \        dh->UpdateBuffs();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore AI system
    during each tick of the game loop. Developers should be aware that this function
    may trigger additional internal updates such as stat recalculations or visual
    effect refreshes, which could impact performance if called excessively outside
    of normal execution flow.
