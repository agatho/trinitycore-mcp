  class: DPSPositioning
  method: GetOptimalDPSRange
  signature: float DPSPositioning::GetOptimalDPSRange(Player * dps, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal distance for a DPS player to maintain
    from their target for maximum damage output.
  description: The GetOptimalDPSRange method determines the ideal positional range
    a Damage Per Second (DPS) player should maintain relative to their target unit.
    This calculation considers various combat mechanics such as weapon reach, spell
    range, and attack speed to optimize damage efficiency. The method evaluates the
    player's current equipment, abilities, and the target's defensive capabilities
    to compute an optimal distance that maximizes DPS potential while ensuring the
    player remains within effective striking or casting range. It is commonly used
    in AI decision-making processes for positioning during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: dps
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the DPS character whose
      optimal range is being calculated
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target enemy or creature
      being analyzed for optimal positioning
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal distance in yards. A return
    value of 0.0 indicates an error condition such as invalid input parameters or
    inability to calculate range due to missing combat data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nfloat optimalRange = DPSPositioning::GetOptimalDPSRange(player,\
      \ target);\nif (optimalRange > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the calculated range for\
      \ positioning logic\n    player->SetFacingToObject(target);\n    player->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with combat state validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nUnit* target = ...;\nif (player && target && player->IsInCombat()\
      \ && target->IsAlive())\n{\n    float optimalRange = DPSPositioning::GetOptimalDPSRange(player,\
      \ target);\n    if (optimalRange > 0.0f)\n    {\n        // Calculate current\
      \ distance\n        float currentDistance = player->GetDistance(target);\n \
      \       \n        // Adjust positioning based on difference\n        if (currentDistance\
      \ < optimalRange - 1.0f)\n        {\n            // Move closer to target\n\
      \            player->MoveTowards(target, optimalRange);\n        }\n       \
      \ else if (currentDistance > optimalRange + 1.0f)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Move away from target\n            player->MoveAwayFrom(target, optimalRange);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving weapon statistics,
    spell ranges, attack speeds, and target mobility. It may cache previous calculations
    for performance optimization in frequently called scenarios. The returned value
    represents a theoretical optimal range that may need adjustment based on environmental
    factors or specific encounter mechanics.
  warnings: The method assumes valid Player and Unit pointers. Passing null or invalid
    pointers will likely result in undefined behavior or return values of 0.0. This
    function should not be called during combat transitions or when player state is
    unstable, as it may produce inaccurate results due to incomplete combat data.
