documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat state of a unit's pet based on the unit's current combat
    status.
  description: The UpdatePetCombatState method synchronizes the combat state of a
    unit's pet with that of the unit itself. When a player enters or exits combat,
    this method ensures that their summoned or controlled pet reflects the same combat
    status. This is crucial for proper pet behavior in World of Warcraft, including
    attack targeting, movement, and AI decision-making. The method typically gets
    called internally by the game engine when combat state changes occur, but can
    also be invoked manually to force synchronization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat State Change
    code: "void Player::OnEnterCombat()\n{\n    Unit::OnEnterCombat();\n    UpdatePetCombatState();\n\
      }\n\nvoid Player::OnLeaveCombat()\n{\n    Unit::OnLeaveCombat();\n    UpdatePetCombatState();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core when combat state
    changes are detected. Developers should not need to call it directly unless implementing
    custom pet behavior logic or debugging combat states. The method does not perform
    any direct AI updates but rather ensures that the pet's internal combat flags
    are consistent with its owner's state.
  warnings: Calling this method excessively without proper checks may cause unnecessary
    overhead or unexpected behavior in pet AI. It should only be invoked when there
    is an actual change in combat status to avoid redundant operations.
