  class: ThreatCalculator
  method: GetLevelDifferenceThreatModifier
  signature: float ThreatCalculator::GetLevelDifferenceThreatModifier(uint8 botLevel,
    uint8 targetLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the threat modifier based on the level difference between a bot
    and its target in World of Warcraft.
  description: 'The GetLevelDifferenceThreatModifier method computes a float value
    that represents how much the level difference between a bot (creature or NPC)
    and its target affects the threat generation. In World of Warcraft''s combat system,
    creatures generate more or less threat depending on the level gap between themselves
    and their target. This modifier is used internally by the ThreatCalculator to
    adjust the base threat values during combat calculations. The method takes two
    parameters: the level of the bot and the level of the target, and returns a multiplier
    that should be applied to the calculated threat. This ensures that higher-level
    targets generate less threat from lower-level attackers, and vice versa.'
  parameters:
  - name: botLevel
    description: The level of the bot (creature or NPC) generating threat. Must be
      a valid player or creature level between 1 and 255.
  - name: targetLevel
    description: The level of the target (player or creature) receiving threat. Must
      be a valid player or creature level between 1 and 255.
  returns: A float value representing the threat modifier based on the level difference.
    Values are typically between 0.0 and 2.0, where 1.0 indicates no modification,
    values below 1.0 reduce threat, and values above 1.0 increase threat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to calculate threat modifier
    code: 'ThreatCalculator calculator;

      uint8 botLevel = 10;

      uint8 targetLevel = 15;

      float modifier = calculator.GetLevelDifferenceThreatModifier(botLevel, targetLevel);

      // Returns a float representing the threat multiplier for level difference'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the modifier in a threat calculation
    code: 'ThreatCalculator calculator;

      uint8 botLevel = 20;

      uint8 targetLevel = 15;

      float baseThreat = 100.0f;

      float modifier = calculator.GetLevelDifferenceThreatModifier(botLevel, targetLevel);

      float finalThreat = baseThreat * modifier;

      // Adjusts threat based on level difference for proper combat balance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal threat calculation system used by TrinityCore's
    AI and combat engine. The exact formula used to compute the modifier is not publicly
    documented, but it likely follows Blizzard's original World of Warcraft mechanics
    where level differences affect threat generation. This function is called frequently
    during combat calculations, so performance is important.
  warnings: Ensure that both botLevel and targetLevel are valid levels (1-255) to
    avoid unexpected behavior or invalid results. Passing invalid values may lead
    to incorrect threat modifiers or undefined behavior in combat systems.
