api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: SetAuctionBudget
  signature: void AuctionHouse::SetAuctionBudget(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 budget)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the auction house budget for a specific player.
  description: The SetAuctionBudget method updates or initializes the auction house
    budget associated with a given player's GUID. This budget typically represents
    the maximum amount of gold a player can spend on placing auctions in the auction
    house. The method likely interacts with internal data structures that track player-specific
    auction spending limits and may enforce constraints to prevent excessive spending.
    It is generally used during player initialization, budget updates, or when modifying
    auction behavior for specific accounts.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction house budget
      is being set. This value must be a valid player GUID within the game's database.
  - name: budget
    description: The new budget amount in copper coins that the player is allowed
      to spend on auctions. Must be a non-negative integer representing the maximum
      auction cost for this player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Auction Budget for Player
    code: AuctionHouse::SetAuctionBudget(12345, 1000000); // Sets player with GUID
      12345's auction budget to 100 gold
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal player data structures or database entries
    related to auction house spending limits. It may be called during player login,
    account modifications, or system-wide budget adjustments.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid is valid and corresponds to an existing player
    in the database. Invalid GUIDs might cause undefined behavior or database corruption
    if not properly validated before calling this method.
