documentation:
  brief: Constructs an ObjectGuidVector from an ObjectVector, extracting GUIDs from
    each object in the vector.
  description: The ObjectGuidVector constructor takes an ObjectVector as input and
    initializes the current instance by extracting the unique identifiers (GUIDs)
    of all objects contained within the input vector. This method is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to convert collections of game objects
    into their corresponding GUID representations, which are essential for tracking
    and referencing entities across different systems. The operation preserves the
    order of objects from the source vector, ensuring that the resulting ObjectGuidVector
    maintains a consistent mapping between original objects and their GUIDs. This
    functionality is particularly useful when working with object pools, spatial queries,
    or any scenario where GUID-based lookups are required instead of direct object
    references.
  parameters:
  - name: objectVector
    description: A constant reference to an ObjectVector containing game objects from
      which GUIDs will be extracted. Each element in this vector must be a valid object
      with a valid GUID assigned.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction from ObjectVector
    code: 'ObjectVector objects;

      // Assume objects are populated with game objects

      ObjectGuidVector guidVector(objects);

      // guidVector now contains GUIDs corresponding to each object in objects'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spatial Query Context
    code: "ObjectVector nearbyObjects = GetNearbyObjects(player, 50.0f);\nObjectGuidVector\
      \ nearbyGuids(nearbyObjects);\nfor (const auto& guid : nearbyGuids)\n{\n   \
      \ if (Creature* creature = ObjectAccessor::GetCreature(*player, guid))\n   \
      \ {\n        // Process each nearby creature\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of GUIDs from the input vector.
    It does not create new objects or deep-copy data; it simply extracts existing
    GUID values. The method assumes that all objects in the input ObjectVector have
    valid GUIDs assigned, and will behave unpredictably if any object lacks a proper
    identifier. Performance-wise, this operation is O(n) where n is the number of
    elements in the input vector.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor with an ObjectVector containing null or invalid
    object pointers, as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all objects
    in the source vector have valid GUIDs before calling this constructor.
