  method: IncrDiminishing
  signature: void Unit::IncrDiminishing(const SpellInfo * auraSpellInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Increments the diminishing returns counter for a spell aura.
  description: This method increases the diminishing returns value for a specific
    spell aura, which is used to track how many times a spell has been applied to
    a target. The method is typically called when applying or refreshing a spell effect
    that has diminishing returns. It helps maintain game balance by preventing certain
    spells from stacking too many times on a target, especially in PvP scenarios where
    players can be affected by multiple instances of the same spell.
  parameters:
  - name: auraSpellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure that defines the spell being applied.
      This parameter determines which diminishing returns category the method will
      increment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit::IncrDiminishing(spellInfo);

      // This would increment the diminishing returns for a specific spell aura'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell application or refresh operations.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly affect the actual spell
    effect, but rather manages the tracking of diminishing returns for game balance
    purposes.
  warnings: Improper handling of diminishing returns can lead to unbalanced gameplay
    and may cause players to be unable to apply certain spells repeatedly. Care should
    be taken when implementing this method in conjunction with other spell mechanics.
