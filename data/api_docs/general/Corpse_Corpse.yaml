  class: Corpse
  method: Corpse
  signature: void Corpse::Corpse(CorpseType type)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Corpse object with the specified corpse type.
  description: The Corpse constructor initializes a new corpse instance of the given
    type. This method sets up the internal state of the corpse object, including its
    type, which determines how the corpse behaves in the game world. The corpse type
    typically indicates whether the corpse is a player corpse or a creature corpse,
    affecting how it's handled by the game engine and what data is stored with it.
    This constructor is usually called internally when creating new corpse objects,
    such as when a player dies and their body becomes a corpse.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of corpse to create. Valid values are typically CorpseType::Bones
      (for creature corpses) or CorpseType::Corpse (for player corpses). This determines
      the corpse's behavior and how it interacts with the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Player Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* playerCorpse = new Corpse(CorpseType::Corpse);

      // This creates a new player corpse instance that will be managed by the game
      world.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Creature Corpse
    code: 'Corpse* creatureCorpse = new Corpse(CorpseType::Bones);

      // This creates a new creature bones corpse, typically used for mob deaths.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically not called directly by game code but rather
    through factory methods or internal systems that manage corpse creation. The Corpse
    object will automatically register itself with the world manager and may be subject
    to cleanup when its lifetime expires or when the player respawns.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of Corpse objects should generally be avoided unless
    you're implementing core game mechanics. Use the provided factory methods or system
    functions that properly handle corpse creation, registration, and cleanup.
