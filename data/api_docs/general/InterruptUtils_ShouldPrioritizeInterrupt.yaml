  class: InterruptUtils
  method: ShouldPrioritizeInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptUtils::ShouldPrioritizeInterrupt(Player * bot, const InterruptTarget
    & target, const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should prioritize interrupting a target based on
    group and combat context.
  description: The ShouldPrioritizeInterrupt method evaluates if a player bot should
    interrupt an enemy target's spellcasting or ability usage. It considers factors
    such as the target's threat level, the bot's current group assignment, and the
    urgency of the interruption needed for group survival or tactical advantage. This
    method is typically used in AI decision-making logic to determine when to use
    interrupt abilities like Silenced, Rooted, or other crowd control spells that
    prevent enemy actions. The method takes into account both individual player state
    and group dynamics to make an informed decision.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      whether to interrupt. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Reference to an InterruptTarget structure containing information
      about the target enemy, including their current spell casting state and threat
      level.
  - name: group
    description: Integer representing the group ID or assignment of the bot. Used
      to determine if the interrupt is needed for group protection or tactical positioning.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should prioritize interrupting the target, false
    otherwise. The decision is based on threat level, group context, and target spell
    casting state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::ShouldPrioritizeInterrupt(bot, target, group)) {\n\
      \    bot->CastSpell(target, INTERRUPT_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple targets
    code: "bool shouldInterrupt = InterruptUtils::ShouldPrioritizeInterrupt(bot, target,\
      \ group);\nif (shouldInterrupt && bot->GetHealthPct() > 20) {\n    // Only interrupt\
      \ if bot has sufficient health\n    bot->CastSpell(target, INTERRUPT_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and relies on internal game
    state tracking. It assumes that the InterruptTarget structure contains valid data
    about the target's current spell casting status. The group parameter should be
    a valid group identifier used by the bot's AI logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is not null before calling this method. Incorrect
    handling of the InterruptTarget can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. This
    method may return false even if the target is casting a high-priority spell, depending
    on group context and bot health status.
