  class: MageSpellCalculator
  method: GetHasteModifier
  signature: float MageSpellCalculator::GetHasteModifier(Player * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the haste modifier for a mage player's spells based
    on their current haste rating and buffs.
  description: The GetHasteModifier method computes the total haste percentage that
    affects spell casting speed for a given mage player. This value is derived from
    the player's base haste rating, any active haste buffs, and class-specific modifiers.
    The returned float represents the multiplicative factor by which spell cast times
    are reduced (e.g., a return value of 1.2 means spells cast 20% faster). This method
    is typically used internally by the spell system to adjust casting times dynamically
    during combat. The calculation accounts for both direct haste bonuses and any
    temporary effects that may influence spell speed, such as haste potions or aura
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the total haste modifier applied to spell casting
    speed. A value of 1.0 indicates no haste bonus, while values greater than 1.0
    indicate increased casting speed (e.g., 1.2 = 20% faster). Values less than 1.0
    would theoretically indicate slower casting, though this is rare in practice.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* magePlayer = ...; // Assume player is a valid mage

      MageSpellCalculator calculator;

      float hasteMod = calculator.GetHasteModifier(magePlayer);

      // Use hasteMod to adjust spell cast times

      float adjustedCastTime = baseCastTime / hasteMod;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: "void CastSpellWithHaste(Player* player, float baseCastTime) {\n    MageSpellCalculator\
      \ calculator;\n    float hasteModifier = calculator.GetHasteModifier(player);\n\
      \    float finalCastTime = baseCastTime / hasteModifier;\n    // Proceed with\
      \ spell casting using adjusted time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches its results to avoid recalculating expensive haste
    computations on every call. It may also consider player buffs, debuffs, and gear
    effects that modify haste rating. The implementation should be thread-safe if
    called from multiple threads during combat simulation.
  warnings: Ensure the Player parameter is valid and represents a mage class character;
    calling this method with a non-mage player might produce unexpected results or
    undefined behavior. The returned value should not be used directly for time calculations
    without proper normalization.
