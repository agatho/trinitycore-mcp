api:
  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: ExportLearningCurve
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::ExportLearningCurve(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & filename) const
documentation:
  brief: Exports learning curve data for a specified bot to a file.
  description: The ExportLearningCurve method saves detailed learning analytics data
    for a specific bot identified by its GUID into a file with the given filename.
    This functionality is typically used for debugging, performance analysis, or generating
    reports on how a bot's learning progress evolves over time. The exported data
    may include metrics such as skill acquisition rates, experience gains, and other
    behavioral patterns during the bot's operation within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose learning curve data will
      be exported. Must correspond to a valid active bot in the system.
  - name: filename
    description: Path and name of the file where the learning curve data will be saved.
      Should include the full path to ensure proper file creation and avoid permission
      issues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Export Usage
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.ExportLearningCurve(12345, "bot_learning_data_12345.txt");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Export with Dynamic Filename
    code: 'std::string filename = "learning_curve_" + std::to_string(botGuid) + ".csv";

      analytics.ExportLearningCurve(botGuid, filename);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs file I/O operations and may block execution until
    the write process completes. Ensure sufficient disk space and appropriate permissions
    for writing to the specified location.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid or a filename that cannot
    be written to will result in undefined behavior or errors. Always validate inputs
    before invoking the method.
