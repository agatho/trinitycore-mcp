  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: CoordinateGroupQuest
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::CoordinateGroupQuest(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a group quest for all members of the specified group.
  description: The CoordinateGroupQuest method assigns a specific quest to all players
    within a given group, ensuring that each member receives the quest and can progress
    through it together. This method is typically used in dynamic quest systems where
    group-based objectives are required. The function iterates through all group members
    and triggers the quest assignment process for each player, maintaining synchronization
    between group members' quest states. It's commonly employed in scenarios such
    as dungeon quests, raid events, or any multi-player quest that requires coordinated
    participation from all group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the quest. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to be assigned to the group members.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Assignment
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    sDynamicQuestSystem->CoordinateGroupQuest(myGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Group Quest Assignment
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ >= 2)\n{\n    uint32 questId = sQuestDataStore->GetRandomGroupQuestForLevel(player->getLevel());\n\
      \    sDynamicQuestSystem->CoordinateGroupQuest(group, questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and contains players. It does
    not perform any validation on whether players are eligible for the quest or if
    they already have it. The method operates synchronously and may block execution
    until all group members have been processed.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely cause a crash.
    Ensure that the group is valid before calling this function. Additionally, assigning
    quests to players who are already on the same quest may lead to unexpected behavior
    or duplicate quest tracking.
