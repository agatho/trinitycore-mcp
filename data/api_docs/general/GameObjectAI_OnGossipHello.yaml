documentation:
  brief: Handles the initial interaction when a player opens the gossip menu for a
    game object
  description: The OnGossipHello method is invoked when a player interacts with a
    GameObject that has gossip functionality enabled. This method serves as the entry
    point for customizing the gossip options displayed to the player. It allows developers
    to implement custom logic such as checking player conditions, modifying gossip
    menus dynamically, or triggering specific actions before displaying the gossip
    interface. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the gossip menu
    was successfully handled and should be displayed to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that initiated the interaction with
      the game object
  returns: True if the gossip menu should be displayed to the player; false if the
    interaction was handled but no gossip menu should appear
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Hello Implementation
    code: "bool GameObjectAI::OnGossipHello(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->HasItemCount(ITEM_ID,\
      \ 1))\n    {\n        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Trade with\
      \ me\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, GOSSIP_ACTION_TRADE);\n        SendGossipMenuFor(player,\
      \ DEFAULT_GOSSIP_MESSAGE, GetGameObject()->GetGUID());\n        return true;\n\
      \    }\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gossip Menu Based on Player Quest Status
    code: "bool GameObjectAI::OnGossipHello(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n    {\n        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT,\
      \ \"Receive reward\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, GOSSIP_ACTION_INFO_DEF + 1);\n   \
      \     SendGossipMenuFor(player, 10001, GetGameObject()->GetGUID());\n      \
      \  return true;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        AddGossipItemFor(player, GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT,\
      \ \"Quest not completed\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, GOSSIP_ACTION_INFO_DEF + 2);\n\
      \        SendGossipMenuFor(player, 10002, GetGameObject()->GetGUID());\n   \
      \     return true;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject's AI system and is called during player
    interaction. It should not be used for heavy computations as it affects gameplay
    responsiveness. The method must be implemented in a derived class that inherits
    from GameObjectAI.
  warnings: Do not call SendGossipMenuFor() or AddGossipItemFor() methods unless you
    have properly initialized the gossip system. Returning false will prevent the
    gossip menu from appearing, which may break expected player interactions.
