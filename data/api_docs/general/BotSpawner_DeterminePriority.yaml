  class: BotSpawner
  method: DeterminePriority
  signature: int BotSpawner::DeterminePriority(const int & request) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the priority level for bot spawning requests based on current
    system load and configuration settings.
  description: The DeterminePriority method evaluates incoming bot spawning requests
    to assign an appropriate priority level. This priority influences the order in
    which bot spawn operations are processed by the spawner system. The method considers
    factors such as existing bot population, server load, and configured thresholds
    to determine whether a request should be handled immediately, queued, or delayed.
    It ensures that bot spawning does not overwhelm the server resources while maintaining
    responsiveness for critical requests.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific bot spawning request.
      This value typically corresponds to a unique request ID or type code used internally
      by the spawner system.
  returns: Returns an integer priority level where higher values indicate higher priority.
    A return value of 0 typically means no priority, while positive integers represent
    increasing levels of urgency. Negative values may be used to denote special handling
    or queuing status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int priority = botSpawner.DeterminePriority(12345);\nif (priority > 0)\
      \ {\n    // Process high-priority request immediately\n    botSpawner.SpawnBot(requestId);\n\
      } else if (priority == 0) {\n    // Handle with default priority\n    botSpawner.QueueBot(requestId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Priority-based scheduling
    code: "int requestId = 54321;\nint priority = botSpawner.DeterminePriority(requestId);\n\
      switch (priority) {\n    case 10:\n        // Immediate processing\n       \
      \ botSpawner.SpawnBot(requestId);\n        break;\n    case 5:\n        // Delayed\
      \ processing\n        botSpawner.DelaySpawn(requestId, 5000);\n        break;\n\
      \    default:\n        // Queue for later processing\n        botSpawner.QueueBot(requestId);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the bot spawning workflow to determine
    appropriate scheduling behavior. The exact priority calculation logic depends
    on internal configuration parameters and runtime conditions such as current player
    count, server performance metrics, and active bot limits.
  warnings: The method should not be called with invalid request IDs as this could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect priority assignments. Ensure that all
    requests passed to this method are valid before calling.
