documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the static flags associated with a creature instance
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the static
    flags that define various behavioral and visual properties of a creature in the
    World of Warcraft environment. These flags are typically loaded from the database
    and determine how the creature behaves during gameplay, such as whether it's selectable,
    attackable, or has specific AI behaviors. The returned value is a bitmask that
    can be combined with other flag values using bitwise operations to check for multiple
    conditions simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of static flags associated with the
    creature. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific flag that defines
    the creature's behavior or properties, such as whether it is selectable, attackable,
    or has special AI behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Check if creature is selectable
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;\nint flags = flagsHolder.GetFlags();\n\
      if (flags & CREATURE_STATIC_FLAG_SELECTABLE)\n{\n    // Creature can be selected\
      \ by players\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combine multiple flag checks
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flagsHolder;\nint flags = flagsHolder.GetFlags();\n\
      if ((flags & CREATURE_STATIC_FLAG_ATTACKABLE) && (flags & CREATURE_STATIC_FLAG_SELECTABLE))\n\
      {\n    // Creature is both attackable and selectable\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides read-only access to the creature's static flags. The
    flags are typically initialized once during creature creation from database entries
    and remain constant throughout the creature's lifetime. Developers should be aware
    that flag values are defined by TrinityCore's internal constants and may vary
    between different versions of the core.
  warnings: Be cautious when directly comparing flag values without proper bitwise
    operations. Always use bitwise AND (&) to check for specific flags rather than
    equality comparisons. Additionally, some flags may have dependencies or interactions
    with other systems that could affect creature behavior in unexpected ways.
