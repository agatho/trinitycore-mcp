  method: Disband
  signature: void Group::Disband(bool hideDestroy)
documentation:
  brief: Disbands the group, removing all members and cleaning up group resources.
  description: The Disband method completely dissolves a group in World of Warcraft,
    removing all players from the group and resetting their group-related states.
    This method is typically called when a player leaves a group or when the group
    leader chooses to disband the group entirely. The method ensures that all group
    members are properly notified and removed from the group, and any group loot settings
    or leadership roles are cleared. If hideDestroy is set to true, the group destruction
    message will not be sent to players, which can be useful for internal operations
    where the group's existence should remain hidden.
  parameters:
  - name: hideDestroy
    description: When true, prevents sending the group destruction message to group
      members. When false (default), sends the standard group disband notification
      to all players in the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Disband
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->Disband();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disband with Hidden Destruction
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->Disband(true);\
      \ // Hide destruction message\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method automatically handles cleanup of all group-related data including
    loot settings, leadership roles, and member lists. It is important to note that
    after calling Disband(), the Group object should not be used anymore as it may
    be deleted by the system.
  warnings: Calling Disband() on a group that has already been disbanded or is invalid
    can lead to undefined behavior. Always verify that the group exists and is valid
    before calling this method.
