  signature: bool BotSpawner::CanSpawnInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can be spawned in the specified zone based on zone
    restrictions and configuration settings.
  description: The CanSpawnInZone method evaluates if it is permissible to spawn a
    bot within a given zone. This check typically considers factors such as zone type
    (e.g., battlegrounds, sanctuaries, PvP zones), player count limits, and server-defined
    restrictions. The method returns true if spawning is allowed, false otherwise.
    It is commonly used during bot initialization or when attempting to create new
    bot instances in specific areas of the game world. This functionality ensures
    that bots are only spawned where they are intended to be active without violating
    game mechanics or balance rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether spawning a bot in the specified zone
    is permitted. Returns true if the zone allows bot spawning, false if it does not.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Bot Can Spawn in Zone
    code: "if (botSpawner->CanSpawnInZone(1234)) {\n    // Proceed with bot creation\n\
      \    botSpawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Log or handle restricted zone\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Cannot spawn bot in zone 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal zone data tables and configuration flags
    to determine validity. It may also consider current server load or active events
    that affect bot spawning.
