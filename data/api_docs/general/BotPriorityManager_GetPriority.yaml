  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: GetPriority
  signature: BotPriority BotPriorityManager::GetPriority(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority level assigned to a specific bot based on its GUID.
  description: The GetPriority method retrieves the BotPriority value associated with
    a given bot identified by its unique Game Object ID (GUID). This function is typically
    used within the TrinityCore bot management system to determine how a particular
    bot should be prioritized in various game scenarios such as quest handling, loot
    distribution, or AI decision-making processes. The method performs a lookup in
    an internal priority mapping structure and returns the corresponding priority
    level for the specified bot. It is designed to be thread-safe and efficient, allowing
    multiple threads to query bot priorities without causing data races.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose priority is being retrieved.
      This value must correspond to a valid bot object in the game world; otherwise,
      the behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns a BotPriority enum value indicating the priority level assigned
    to the specified bot. Possible values may include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CUSTOM
    depending on how priorities are configured within the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotPriority priority = botPriorityManager.GetPriority(12345); // Retrieves
      priority for bot with GUID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Priority in Logic
    code: "if (botPriorityManager.GetPriority(12345) >= BotPriority::HIGH) {\n   \
      \ // Execute high-priority actions for this bot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided botGuid corresponds to an existing
    bot in the system. It is recommended to validate the existence of the bot before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Calling GetPriority with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior, including potential segmentation faults or incorrect priority
    values. Always ensure that the GUID refers to a valid bot object.
