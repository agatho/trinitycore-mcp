documentation:
  brief: Enables the wildfire infusion effect for applicable wildfire bombs in the
    manager.
  description: The EnableWildfireInfusion method activates the wildfire infusion mechanic
    for all wildfire bombs managed by this WildfireBombManager instance. This method
    typically sets internal flags or states that allow the bombs to apply the wildfire
    infusion buff or damage over time effect when triggered. The functionality is
    commonly used in conjunction with spell effects or abilities that require the
    infusion to be active before bomb detonation occurs. This method does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct return operations, acting purely as a state
    management function within the wildfire bomb system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'WildfireBombManager* manager = new WildfireBombManager();

      manager->EnableWildfireInfusion();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state flags within the WildfireBombManager
    to indicate that infusion is active. It should be called before any wildfire bombs
    are detonated if the infusion effect is required for those explosions.
