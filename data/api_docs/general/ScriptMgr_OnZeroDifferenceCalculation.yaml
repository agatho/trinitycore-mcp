  class: ScriptMgr
  method: OnZeroDifferenceCalculation
  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnZeroDifferenceCalculation(uint8 & diff, uint8 playerLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the calculated difference for zero-level player encounters in combat
    calculations.
  description: The OnZeroDifferenceCalculation method is invoked during combat calculations
    when a player's level is zero, allowing scripts to modify the computed difference
    value used for determining encounter outcomes. This method provides an opportunity
    for custom logic to influence how low-level or unlevelled players interact with
    game mechanics such as experience gain, loot distribution, or combat resolution.
    The diff parameter is passed by reference and can be modified to alter the outcome
    of the calculation. This hook is particularly relevant in scenarios involving
    player progression, quest completion, or special game events where zero-level
    characters may be introduced.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: A reference to the calculated difference value that may be modified
      by scripts. This represents a combat-related metric used for determining encounter
      results.
  - name: playerLevel
    description: The level of the player involved in the calculation, which is expected
      to be zero for this specific hook invocation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Modifying combat difference for zero-level players
    code: "void OnZeroDifferenceCalculation(uint8& diff, uint8 playerLevel)\n{\n \
      \   if (playerLevel == 0)\n    {\n        diff = 5; // Set a fixed difference\
      \ value for zero-level players\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore scripting system and is called during
    internal combat calculations. It is important to note that modifying the diff
    parameter can affect game balance, especially in PvP or PvE scenarios where level-based
    mechanics are involved.
  warnings: Modifying the diff value directly may lead to unexpected behavior in combat
    resolution if not handled carefully. Ensure that any changes made to diff maintain
    logical consistency with the intended gameplay experience.
