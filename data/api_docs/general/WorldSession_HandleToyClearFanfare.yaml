documentation:
  brief: Clears the toy fanfare notification for the player's current toy.
  description: The HandleToyClearFanfare method processes incoming client requests
    to clear a toy fanfare notification that was previously displayed to the player.
    This typically occurs when a player interacts with a toy item and wishes to dismiss
    the associated visual or audio fanfare effect. The method handles the packet received
    from the client, validates the request, and ensures that the appropriate fanfare
    is cleared for the specified toy. It is part of the general WorldSession handling
    for toy-related interactions in the game.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the WorldSession's packet handling
    system when a client sends a toy fanfare clear request. It does not directly interact
    with the database or perform complex operations, but rather processes and acknowledges
    the client's intent to dismiss a toy notification.
