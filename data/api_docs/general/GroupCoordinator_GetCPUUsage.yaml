api:
  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float GroupCoordinator::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the group coordinator
    thread.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a measurement of how much CPU time
    the GroupCoordinator instance is consuming relative to total available processing
    power. This metric is useful for performance monitoring, load balancing decisions,
    and identifying potential bottlenecks in group management operations. The value
    returned represents an instantaneous snapshot that may fluctuate based on system
    load and active group activities such as player movement, loot distribution, or
    quest progression within the group. This method typically uses high-resolution
    timers to compute usage over a short time interval for accuracy.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value between 0.0 and 100.0 representing the percentage
    of CPU utilization by the group coordinator thread. A value of 0.0 indicates no
    CPU usage, while 100.0 indicates maximum possible usage (i.e., full utilization).
    Values above 100.0 may occur in multi-core systems where multiple threads contribute
    to the measurement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CPU Usage Monitoring
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();

      float cpuUsage = coordinator->GetCPUUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Current Group Coordinator CPU usage: %.2f%%",
      cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Alert Based on CPU Usage
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator();\n\
      float cpuUsage = coordinator->GetCPUUsage();\nif (cpuUsage > 80.0f)\n{\n   \
      \ TC_LOG_WARN(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"High CPU usage detected in Group Coordinator:\
      \ %.2f%%\", cpuUsage);\n    // Trigger performance optimization or alerting\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on platform-specific timing functions to calculate CPU
    usage. On Windows systems, it uses QueryPerformanceCounter and GetSystemTimes
    APIs. The measurement includes both user-mode and kernel-mode CPU time for the
    thread. For accurate readings, multiple calls should be averaged over time rather
    than relying on single measurements.
  warnings: The returned value is not thread-safe and may change between the time
    of call and when it's processed. In high-frequency monitoring scenarios, consider
    caching results or using a dedicated monitoring thread to avoid race conditions.
    Also note that this measurement does not account for CPU usage by other subsystems
    or threads unrelated to group coordination.
