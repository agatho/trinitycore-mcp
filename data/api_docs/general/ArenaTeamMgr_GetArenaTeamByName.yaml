  method: GetArenaTeamByName
  signature: ArenaTeam * ArenaTeamMgr::GetArenaTeamByName(int arenaTeamName) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an arena team object by its name from the arena team manager.
  description: The GetArenaTeamByName method searches through all registered arena
    teams within the ArenaTeamMgr and returns a pointer to the arena team that matches
    the specified name. If no matching arena team is found, it returns a null pointer.
    This method is commonly used during arena team lookups, such as when processing
    player commands or validating team names during arena matchmaking. The arena team
    name is case-sensitive and must match exactly. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is safe for read-only access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ArenaTeam object if a matching team is found; otherwise,
    returns nullptr if no team with the specified name exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamByName(\"TeamName\");\nif\
      \ (team)\n{\n    // Team found, proceed with operations\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_TEAM_FOUND,\
      \ team->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Team not found\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_TEAM_NOT_FOUND);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the arena teams, so performance
    may degrade with a large number of teams. It is recommended to cache results if
    this method is called frequently.
  warnings: The returned pointer should be checked for null before use to prevent
    dereferencing a null pointer. Also, since this is a const method, it cannot modify
    any internal state but only retrieves existing data.
