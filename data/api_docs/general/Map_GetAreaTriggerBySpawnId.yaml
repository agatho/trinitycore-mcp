  method: GetAreaTriggerBySpawnId
  signature: AreaTrigger * Map::GetAreaTriggerBySpawnId(int spawnId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the area trigger object associated with a specific spawn ID.
  description: This method retrieves an AreaTrigger object from the map's internal
    collection based on the provided spawn ID. It is used to access area trigger data
    that has been spawned in the world, allowing developers to interact with area
    trigger mechanics such as triggers, effects, and spatial data. The method operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's map system and is essential for managing area
    trigger references during gameplay. This function provides direct access to area
    trigger objects without requiring additional lookup mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an AreaTrigger object if found, otherwise returns
    nullptr if no matching area trigger exists for the given spawn ID. The returned
    pointer may be null when the area trigger has not yet been spawned or has already
    been removed from the map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = map->GetAreaTriggerBySpawnId(12345);\nif (trigger\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the area trigger\n    trigger->SetPhaseMask(1);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe when used within the context of map operations,
    but requires careful handling during concurrent access. Performance considerations
    include potential overhead from searching through internal maps for matching area
    triggers, especially if many are present. The method relies on internal map data
    structures and should be used cautiously in performance-sensitive code.
  warnings: This method may return nullptr if no area trigger exists for the given
    spawn ID, which could lead to null pointer dereferences if not properly checked.
    Avoid calling this method during map cleanup or when area triggers are being removed
    from memory.
