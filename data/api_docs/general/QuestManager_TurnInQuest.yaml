  class: QuestManager
  method: TurnInQuest
  signature: bool QuestManager::TurnInQuest(uint32 questId, uint32 rewardChoice, WorldObject
    * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a quest by turning it in to the specified quest giver with an optional
    reward choice.
  description: The TurnInQuest method processes the completion of a player's quest
    by validating the quest requirements, checking if the player has the necessary
    items or kills, and awarding the selected reward. It interacts with the quest
    system to update quest status, grant experience, items, and reputation as appropriate.
    The method ensures that all quest conditions are met before allowing the quest
    to be turned in. This function is typically called when a player interacts with
    a quest giver object to turn in a completed quest.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: rewardChoice
    description: The index of the reward choice selected by the player (0-based).
      If the quest has multiple reward options, this determines which one is awarded.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject representing the quest giver. Must be
      a valid object such as an NPC or GameObject that can accept quest completions.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully turned in and all rewards were
    processed, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid quest
    ID, missing requirements, or other validation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager().TurnInQuest(12345, 0, npc)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ completed successfully\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Quest completed!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to turn in quest\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Failed to complete quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Turn-In with Reward Choice
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nuint32 rewardChoice = 2; // Select third reward\
      \ option\nWorldObject* questGiver = player->GetNPC();\n\nif (player->GetQuestManager().TurnInQuest(questId,\
      \ rewardChoice, questGiver)) {\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD, 1);\n  \
      \  player->ModifyMoney(10000);\n    // Additional reward processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally validates quest completion requirements including
    item possession, kill counts, and quest state. It handles both single and multiple
    reward options for quests. The method assumes that the player has already met
    all prerequisite conditions for the quest. This is a core function in the quest
    system and should be used carefully to maintain game balance.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in incorrect
    quest progression or reward distribution. Ensure that the quest giver object is
    valid and that the quest ID exists in the database before calling. The rewardChoice
    parameter must be within valid range for the specific quest, otherwise behavior
    is undefined.
