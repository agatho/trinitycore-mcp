  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: CombineStrategies
  signature: OptimizationStrategy PerformanceOptimizer::CombineStrategies(const OptimizationStrategy
    & a, const OptimizationStrategy & b) const
documentation:
  brief: Combines two optimization strategies into a single strategy based on performance
    criteria.
  description: The CombineStrategies method takes two OptimizationStrategy objects
    and merges them into a new, unified strategy. This operation is typically used
    in performance-critical systems where multiple optimization approaches need to
    be merged for better overall efficiency. The method evaluates both input strategies
    and returns a combined result that represents an optimized approach. In the context
    of TrinityCore's architecture, this might be used when integrating different performance
    tuning mechanisms or when dynamically adjusting server resource allocation based
    on current load conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: First optimization strategy to be combined. This strategy defines
      initial performance parameters and settings.
  - name: b
    description: Second optimization strategy to be combined. This strategy provides
      additional performance parameters that will be merged with the first strategy.
  returns: Returns a new OptimizationStrategy object that represents the combination
    of the two input strategies. The resulting strategy incorporates elements from
    both inputs, potentially optimizing for better performance under various conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Combination
    code: 'OptimizationStrategy strat1 = ...; // Define first strategy

      OptimizationStrategy strat2 = ...; // Define second strategy

      PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      OptimizationStrategy combined = optimizer.CombineStrategies(strat1, strat2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Performance Tuning
    code: 'OptimizationStrategy loadBased = optimizer.CreateLoadBasedStrategy();

      OptimizationStrategy timeBased = optimizer.CreateTimeBasedStrategy();

      OptimizationStrategy finalStrategy = optimizer.CombineStrategies(loadBased,
      timeBased);

      // Apply combined strategy to adjust server performance dynamically'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient and should not cause significant
    performance overhead. It assumes that both input strategies are valid and properly
    initialized. The combination logic may prioritize one strategy over another depending
    on internal implementation details, which could affect the resulting combined
    strategy.
  warnings: Ensure that both input strategies are compatible and represent similar
    performance domains. Combining incompatible strategies might lead to unexpected
    behavior or suboptimal performance outcomes.
