  class: BattlegroundMgr
  method: RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue
  signature: void BattlegroundMgr::RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue(uint32 mapId, uint32
    instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a battleground instance from the free slot queue based on map ID
    and instance ID.
  description: The RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue method removes a specific battleground
    instance from the free slot queue within the BattlegroundMgr. This function is
    typically invoked when a battleground instance becomes full or is no longer available
    for new players to join. It ensures that the instance is properly removed from
    the queue of available battlegrounds, preventing further attempts to add players
    to an already occupied or invalid battleground. The method operates on the map
    ID and instance ID to uniquely identify the battleground instance to be removed.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier for the battleground map type (e.g., 30 for
      Alterac Valley, 489 for Warsong Gulch).
  - name: instanceId
    description: The instance ID of the specific battleground instance to be removed
      from the free slot queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific battleground instance from the free slot queue
    code: BattlegroundMgr::instance()->RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue(30, 12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground management system and should
    only be called when necessary to maintain queue integrity. It's typically used
    in conjunction with other BattlegroundMgr methods like AddToBGFreeSlotQueue or
    UpdateBattlegrounds.
