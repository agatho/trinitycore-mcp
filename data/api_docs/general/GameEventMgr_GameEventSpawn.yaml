documentation:
  brief: Spawns all game event objects and creatures for the specified event ID.
  description: The GameEventSpawn method is responsible for activating and spawning
    all game event-related entities, including creatures, game objects, and other
    in-game elements associated with a specific event. This method is typically called
    when a game event begins, ensuring that all necessary spawns are created and made
    visible to players. It handles the logic of determining which objects should be
    spawned based on the event's configuration and current state. The method does
    not directly manage the event's duration or cleanup; it only performs the initial
    spawn operation for the given event ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Spawn all creatures and objects for event ID 42
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->GameEventSpawn(42);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the game event system when
    an event starts, but can also be manually called for testing or special circumstances.
    It operates on the active event context and assumes that the event has been properly
    initialized in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper event initialization may result in
    undefined behavior or missing spawns. Ensure that the event ID exists in the game
    event table before invoking this method.
