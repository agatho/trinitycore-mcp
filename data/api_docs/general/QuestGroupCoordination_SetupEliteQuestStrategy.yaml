  class: QuestGroupCoordination
  method: SetupEliteQuestStrategy
  signature: void QuestGroupCoordination::SetupEliteQuestStrategy(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes elite quest strategy for a group participating in a specific
    quest.
  description: The SetupEliteQuestStrategy method configures and initializes the elite
    quest participation logic for a given group engaging with a specified quest. This
    method ensures that all group members are properly coordinated for elite quest
    requirements, including handling loot distribution, quest progress tracking, and
    synchronization of quest-related events. It typically sets up necessary flags,
    initializes quest state variables, and prepares the group's members for elite
    quest mechanics such as shared rewards or special quest conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group participating
      in the quest. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which elite strategy is being
      set up. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Elite Quest Strategy Setup
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 eliteQuestId = 12345;

      questCoordination->SetupEliteQuestStrategy(myGroup, eliteQuestId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a group is officially starting an
    elite quest. It assumes that the group has already been validated and that all
    members are present in the world. The method may internally modify group state
    variables and player quest data.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the group or quest ID
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is valid and
    the quest exists before invoking this method.
