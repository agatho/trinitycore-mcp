documentation:
  brief: Processes respawn events for objects on the map
  description: The ProcessRespawns method handles the respawn logic for all game objects,
    creatures, and game entities that have been marked for respawning within the map.
    This method is typically called during the map's update cycle to ensure that objects
    that have been destroyed or defeated are properly restored according to their
    respawn timers. It manages the transition of objects from a dead or inactive state
    back to an active state, maintaining the dynamic nature of the game world. The
    method ensures that respawns occur at appropriate times and in the correct locations
    as defined by the object's spawn parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in map update loop
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   ProcessRespawns();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically as part of the map's regular
    update cycle. It should not be called manually unless implementing custom respawn
    behavior. The method processes all respawns in a single pass, which may have performance
    implications on maps with many respawnable objects.
