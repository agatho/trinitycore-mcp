documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information string for ScriptInfo object
  description: The GetDebugInfo method generates and returns a formatted string containing
    diagnostic information about the ScriptInfo object. This method is primarily used
    for debugging purposes during development and testing phases of TrinityCore addons
    or script implementations. The returned string typically includes key properties
    such as script identifiers, type information, and other relevant metadata that
    helps developers understand the current state of the script instance. The method
    does not modify any internal state of the object and is safe to call from any
    thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the ScriptInfo
    object, including its type, identifier, and other relevant metadata for diagnostic
    purposes
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'ScriptInfo* script = sScriptMgr->GetScriptById(12345);

      std::string debugInfo = script->GetDebugInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("scripts", "Script debug info: %s", debugInfo.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for development and debugging use only. The exact
    format of the returned string may vary between different versions of TrinityCore
    and should not be relied upon for production logic. The method performs no heavy
    computations and has minimal performance impact.
