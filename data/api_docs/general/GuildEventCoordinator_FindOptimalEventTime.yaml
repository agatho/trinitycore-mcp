  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: FindOptimalEventTime
  signature: uint32 GuildEventCoordinator::FindOptimalEventTime(uint32 guildId, GuildEventType
    eventType, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Finds the optimal time to schedule a guild event based on guild activity
    and event type.
  description: The FindOptimalEventTime method determines the best available time
    slot for scheduling a guild event, considering factors such as guild member availability,
    existing event conflicts, and event type requirements. This method is typically
    used by the GuildEventCoordinator to automate event planning and ensure minimal
    disruption to guild activities. The returned timestamp represents a Unix time
    value indicating when the event should ideally be scheduled. The method takes
    into account guild-specific constraints and event duration to provide a suitable
    scheduling recommendation.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild for which the optimal event time
      is being calculated
  - name: eventType
    description: The type of guild event (e.g., raid, dungeon, meeting) that determines
      scheduling constraints and preferences
  - name: duration
    description: The expected duration of the event in minutes, used to ensure sufficient
      time slots are available for scheduling
  returns: Returns a Unix timestamp (uint32) representing the optimal time to schedule
    the guild event. A value of 0 indicates that no suitable time could be found or
    an error occurred during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for raid scheduling
    code: uint32 optimalTime = guildEventCoordinator->FindOptimalEventTime(12345,
      GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_RAID, 180);
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding optimal time for a weekly meeting
    code: uint32 meetingTime = guildEventCoordinator->FindOptimalEventTime(67890,
      GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_MEETING, 60);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers guild member online status, raid lockout times,
    and other scheduling constraints. The implementation may cache recent scheduling
    decisions for performance optimization. The returned time is in UTC Unix timestamp
    format.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if no suitable time slot is available or if the
    guild has insufficient data to make a determination. Always validate the return
    value before using it for event scheduling.
