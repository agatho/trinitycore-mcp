  method: SetVoteKick
  signature: void LfgGroupData::SetVoteKick(bool active)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the vote kick status for a group in the LFG system.
  description: The SetVoteKick method updates the internal state of a LfgGroupData
    object to indicate whether a vote kick is currently active for the group. This
    functionality is part of TrinityCore's Looking for Group (LFG) system, which manages
    player groups and their participation in dungeons or raids. When a vote kick is
    active, it typically means that the group is in the process of voting to remove
    a specific member. The method does not perform any validation or trigger external
    actions directly; it simply updates an internal boolean flag within the LfgGroupData
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: active
    description: A boolean value indicating whether vote kick is active (true) or
      inactive (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate Vote Kick
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      groupData.SetVoteKick(true); // Enables vote kick for the group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate Vote Kick
    code: 'LfgGroupData groupData;

      groupData.SetVoteKick(false); // Disables vote kick for the group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the LFG subsystem. It's important
    to note that setting this flag does not automatically initiate or conclude a vote
    kick process; it merely reflects the current state of the vote kick mechanism
    within the group data structure.
