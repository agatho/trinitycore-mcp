  class: FormationManager
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 FormationManager::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds used by the FormationManager
    for processing formation updates.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval, measured
    in milliseconds, that the FormationManager uses to periodically update and synchronize
    the positions of units within a formation. This interval determines how frequently
    the manager evaluates and adjusts unit positioning to maintain the defined formation
    layout. The value is typically configured based on game mechanics and performance
    considerations to balance responsiveness with system efficiency. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. This indicates
    how often the FormationManager processes formation updates, with typical values
    ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds depending on the specific implementation
    and game requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Formation Update Interval
    code: 'uint32 interval = formationManager->GetUpdateInterval();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Formation update interval is %u ms", interval);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with game loop timing systems
    to ensure that formation updates occur at appropriate intervals without causing
    performance bottlenecks. The returned value may be adjusted dynamically based
    on server load or specific formation types.
