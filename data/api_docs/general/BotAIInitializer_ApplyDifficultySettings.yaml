documentation:
  brief: Applies difficulty-specific settings to bot AI behavior.
  description: The ApplyDifficultySettings method configures various AI parameters
    and behaviors for bot characters based on the current game difficulty level. This
    ensures that bots adapt their combat strategies, decision-making processes, and
    overall performance to match the intended challenge level of the game world. The
    method typically adjusts factors such as aggression levels, spell usage, target
    selection priorities, and movement patterns to align with the selected difficulty
    setting.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.ApplyDifficultySettings();

      // Configures bot AI based on current difficulty settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during bot initialization or when difficulty
    settings change to ensure proper AI behavior adjustment. It may internally query
    the current game difficulty from the world state and apply corresponding configuration
    values.
