  signature: bool Player::IsBeingTeleportedNear() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently being teleported near another
    player or object.
  description: This method checks if the player is in the process of being teleported
    to a nearby location, typically used during teleportation events such as when
    a player is being moved to a specific location or when a player is being teleported
    to another player. It returns true when the player's teleportation state is active
    and false otherwise. The method is primarily used for internal game mechanics
    handling and can be useful in detecting player movement during teleportation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently being teleported near another player
    or object, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking teleportation status
    code: "if (player->IsBeingTeleportedNear()) {\n    // Handle teleportation logic\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other teleportation-related
    methods and may be part of a larger system that handles player movement during
    game events. It does not directly affect the player's actual location but rather
    indicates whether they are in the process of being moved.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player is currently teleporting,
    as it only indicates if they are being teleported near another object or player.
    It may return false even when a player is actively teleporting.
