  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CheckFaction
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckFaction(::Player * bot, ::Creature *
    creature) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot player can interact with a creature based on faction neutrality
    or hostility.
  description: The CheckFaction method evaluates whether a given bot player is allowed
    to interact with a specific creature by examining their respective faction relationships.
    It determines if the bot's faction status permits interaction, which may be restricted
    based on whether the creature is hostile, neutral, or friendly towards the player.
    This method is typically used in AI logic to prevent bots from engaging in inappropriate
    interactions with creatures that would normally result in combat or other negative
    consequences. The check considers both the player's and creature's faction settings,
    including reputation levels and faction flags.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character attempting
      interaction
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that the bot is trying to interact
      with
  returns: Returns true if the bot can safely interact with the creature based on
    faction rules, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that
    the interaction would result in hostility or that the faction relationship prevents
    interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Faction Check Usage
    code: "if (validator.CheckFaction(botPlayer, targetCreature)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with interaction logic\n    botPlayer->TalkToCreature(targetCreature);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Avoid interaction or handle appropriately\n    botPlayer->MoveToCreature(targetCreature,\
      \ 5.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Bot AI Logic
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool CanInteractWith(::Player* bot, ::Creature*\
      \ creature) {\n        return InteractionValidator().CheckFaction(bot, creature);\n\
      \    }\n};\n\n// Usage within AI decision making\nif (botAI.CanInteractWith(playerBot,\
      \ npc)) {\n    // Perform quest-related or vendor interactions\n    playerBot->GossipHello(npc);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal TrinityCore faction tables and reputation
    systems to determine compatibility. It may consider flags such as 'Hostile' or
    'Friendly' in the creature's faction template, as well as the player's current
    reputation with that faction. Performance is generally low impact since it only
    involves faction lookups and comparisons.
  warnings: Ensure both player and creature pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid crashes. The method may return false for creatures that are normally
    hostile but could be interacted with under special conditions (e.g., after completing
    a quest).
