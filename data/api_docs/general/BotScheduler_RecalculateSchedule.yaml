  class: BotScheduler
  method: RecalculateSchedule
  signature: void BotScheduler::RecalculateSchedule(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Recalculates the scheduling for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The RecalculateSchedule method updates the internal scheduling logic
    for a bot identified by the provided GUID. This function is typically invoked
    when changes to the bot's state, behavior, or environment require an adjustment
    to its planned actions or timing. It ensures that the bot's next scheduled task
    or action aligns with current conditions and priorities. The method does not return
    any value but modifies the internal state of the scheduler for the specified bot.
    This is commonly used in dynamic gameplay scenarios where bot behavior needs to
    be responsive to changing conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose schedule needs to be
      recalculated. Must correspond to a valid active bot within the scheduler system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recalculate schedule for a specific bot
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      scheduler.RecalculateSchedule(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as frequent recalculations may impact
    performance. It is recommended to only invoke this when necessary, such as after
    significant changes in bot state or environment.
