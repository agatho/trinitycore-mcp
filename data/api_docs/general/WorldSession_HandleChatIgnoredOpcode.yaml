documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming chat ignored opcode from client to handle reported ignored
    players
  description: This method handles the ChatReportIgnored opcode sent by the client
    when a player reports another player for ignoring them in chat. It processes the
    report and updates the ignore list state accordingly. The method is part of the
    WorldSession's chat handling system and integrates with the game's messaging infrastructure
    to manage player interactions and communication preferences. This functionality
    supports the core chat system mechanics that allow players to block or ignore
    other players within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: chatReportIgnored
    description: The packet containing information about the ignored player report,
      including the target player's GUID and reason for reporting
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleChatIgnoredOpcode(WorldPackets::Chat::ChatReportIgnored\
      \ & chatReportIgnored)\n{\n    // Process the ignored player report\n    Player*\
      \ player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n    // Validate\
      \ target player exists\n    ObjectGuid targetGuid = chatReportIgnored.Target;\n\
      \    Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(targetGuid);\n    if\
      \ (!targetPlayer)\n        return;\n    \n    // Add to ignore list or update\
      \ existing entry\n    player->GetSocial()->AddToIgnoreList(targetPlayer->GetGUID(),\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main session packet handling loop.
    The implementation should validate that both players exist and are in the same
    world instance before processing the ignore report. The method may trigger additional
    network messages to inform other clients about the updated ignore status.
  warnings: Improper handling of this opcode could lead to security vulnerabilities
    or abuse where players might spam ignore reports. Ensure proper rate limiting
    and validation of player relationships before adding entries to ignore lists.
