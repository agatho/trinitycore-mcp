  signature: void PacketFilter::~PacketFilter()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PacketFilter instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The PacketFilter destructor is responsible for cleaning up any memory
    or system resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the PacketFilter
    object. This method is automatically invoked when a PacketFilter instance goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's networking
    subsystem, this typically involves releasing internal buffers, unregistering from
    packet handling chains, and ensuring no dangling references remain. The destructor
    ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability during
    server shutdown or object destruction.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'PacketFilter* filter = new PacketFilter();

      // ... use the filter ...

      delete filter; // Destructor is called automatically here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destruction
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PacketFilter filter;\n    // ... use the filter\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived classes. It's important to note that this method should not be called
    directly unless explicitly managing object lifetime through raw pointers. TrinityCore's
    memory management system handles most cleanup automatically.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor on objects managed by smart pointers
    or containers, as this will lead to undefined behavior. The destructor assumes
    all internal state is valid and should not be called after the object has already
    been destroyed.
