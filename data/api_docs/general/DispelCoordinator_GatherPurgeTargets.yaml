documentation:
  brief: Collects and counts all valid targets eligible for purging effects within
    the current context.
  description: The GatherPurgeTargets method is responsible for identifying and gathering
    all eligible units or objects that can be affected by a purge operation. This
    typically involves scanning the current environment or target list for entities
    that meet specific criteria such as being afflicted by dispellable effects, having
    certain auras, or satisfying other game logic conditions required for purging.
    The method returns an integer count representing how many valid targets were found
    and added to the internal purge target collection. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with dispel mechanics, particularly when preparing to apply area-of-effect purges
    or targeted dispels that remove harmful effects from multiple units simultaneously.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of valid targets successfully gathered
    for purging. A return value of zero means no eligible targets were found, while
    a positive integer represents the count of targets added to the purge target list.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dispel Logic
    code: "int targetCount = coordinator.GatherPurgeTargets();\nif (targetCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with applying purge effects to gathered targets\n  \
      \  coordinator.ApplyPurgeEffects();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Purge Targets Before Casting
    code: "DispelCoordinator coordinator;\nint purgeTargets = coordinator.GatherPurgeTargets();\n\
      if (purgeTargets > 0)\n{\n    // Log or announce that purge will affect X targets\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Preparing to purge %d targets.\", purgeTargets);\n  \
      \  // Continue with dispel spell logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No valid targets,\
      \ handle accordingly\n    sLog->outString(\"No valid targets found for purge.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before initiating any purge-based effect
    to ensure that the system has a proper list of eligible targets. It may internally
    perform checks on aura states, faction relationships, and other conditions relevant
    to purging mechanics. The gathered targets are usually stored in an internal container
    within the DispelCoordinator class for subsequent processing.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called only when appropriate context exists
    (e.g., during a dispel spell execution or purge effect application). Calling it
    outside of valid game logic may result in incorrect target gathering or performance
    issues due to unnecessary scanning. Also, be aware that the method's behavior
    might vary depending on the specific implementation details of the DispelCoordinator
    class.
