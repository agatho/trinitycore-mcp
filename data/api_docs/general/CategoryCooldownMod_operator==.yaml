documentation:
  brief: Compares two CategoryCooldownMod objects for equality based on their internal
    state.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this CategoryCooldownMod
    object and another CategoryCooldownMod object to determine if they are equivalent.
    This comparison typically involves checking whether all relevant member variables
    or properties of both objects match exactly. In the context of TrinityCore's cooldown
    management system, this method ensures that two cooldown modifiers with identical
    category and effect parameters are treated as equal, which is crucial for proper
    cooldown handling and preventing duplicate application of similar effects.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The CategoryCooldownMod object to compare against this instance.
      This parameter represents the right-hand side operand in the equality comparison.
  returns: Returns true if both CategoryCooldownMod objects have identical internal
    states, indicating they represent the same cooldown modifier; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'CategoryCooldownMod mod1;

      CategoryCooldownMod mod2;

      bool isEqual = (mod1 == mod2); // Returns true if both objects are equivalent'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Cooldown Management Logic
    code: "std::vector<CategoryCooldownMod> activeMods;\nCategoryCooldownMod newMod;\n\
      bool exists = std::find(activeMods.begin(), activeMods.end(), newMod) != activeMods.end();\n\
      if (!exists) {\n    activeMods.push_back(newMod);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using member-wise comparison of the
    object's data members. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections
    as it may involve multiple comparisons depending on the internal structure of
    CategoryCooldownMod.
