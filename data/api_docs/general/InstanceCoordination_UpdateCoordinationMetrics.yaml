  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: UpdateCoordinationMetrics
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::UpdateCoordinationMetrics(uint32 groupId,
    bool wasSuccessful, uint32 responseTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates coordination metrics for a specific group instance.
  description: The UpdateCoordinationMetrics method records and processes performance
    and success data for group-based instance encounters within the TrinityCore framework.
    It tracks whether an instance attempt was successful and measures the response
    time, which helps in monitoring server performance, balancing player load, and
    maintaining game stability. This method is typically invoked after an instance
    completion or failure event to update internal tracking systems.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the group participating in the instance encounter.
      Used to associate metrics with a specific group.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the instance coordination attempt was
      successful (true) or failed (false).
  - name: responseTime
    description: Elapsed time in milliseconds since the start of the instance coordination
      process until completion or failure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: InstanceCoordination::UpdateCoordinationMetrics(12345, true, 4500);
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Failed Instance Attempt
    code: InstanceCoordination::UpdateCoordinationMetrics(67890, false, 8000);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal statistics or logs for monitoring purposes.
    It may be called from various subsystems such as dungeon finder, raid coordination,
    or group management modules. The groupId should correspond to an active group
    in the instance system.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId corresponds to a valid and active group before
    calling this method. Passing invalid or stale group IDs could lead to incorrect
    metrics being recorded or potential system errors.
