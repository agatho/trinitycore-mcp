  brief: Updates the vengeance demon spikes tracker state based on current game conditions
    and player actions.
  description: The Update method in VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker is responsible for
    maintaining the internal state of the vengeance demon spikes mechanic. This method
    typically processes any changes in the player's combat state, spell casts, or
    damage events that may affect the demon spikes tracker. It ensures that the tracker
    accurately reflects the current status of vengeance demon spikes, including their
    activation, duration, and any associated effects. The method is usually called
    during game loop updates or in response to specific combat events to keep the
    tracking system synchronized with the player's current state.

    method directly unless implementing custom combat logic that requires manual state
    synchronization.
