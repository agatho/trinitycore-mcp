  signature: void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states and modifiers for the Protection Warrior class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for refreshing and applying all
    active buffs, auras, and stat modifications that are currently affecting the Protection
    Warrior instance. This method typically iterates through the warrior's active
    aura list, recalculates derived stats such as armor, block chance, and damage
    reduction, and ensures that all buff effects are properly applied to the character's
    combat capabilities. It is commonly invoked during combat updates, aura changes,
    or when new buffs are applied to maintain accurate character state. The method
    may also handle synchronization of visual effects and cooldowns related to buffed
    abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    protectionWarrior.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Buff Update Trigger
    code: "void OnAuraApply(Aura* aura)\n{\n    // Handle specific aura application\
      \ logic\n    if (aura->GetSpellInfo()->Id == 12345) // Example buff ID\n   \
      \ {\n        protectionWarrior.UpdateBuffs();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during combat to ensure accurate
    stat calculation. It may trigger additional internal updates such as spell cooldown
    recalculations and UI state refreshes. The method is typically not thread-safe
    and should only be called from the main game thread or within a controlled context.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs too frequently outside of combat may cause performance
    degradation due to redundant calculations. Avoid calling this method during critical
    sections where stat consistency is paramount, as it might temporarily alter character
    state before finalization.
