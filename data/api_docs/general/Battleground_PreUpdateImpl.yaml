documentation:
  brief: Performs pre-update logic for the battleground before main update cycle begins
  description: The PreUpdateImpl method is a virtual implementation function called
    during the battleground's update cycle, typically before the main update logic
    executes. This method allows battleground implementations to perform necessary
    setup, state checks, or preparatory actions before the core battleground mechanics
    are processed. It serves as a hook point for custom battleground behavior and
    can be used to manage game state transitions, handle player interactions, or execute
    time-based operations that must occur prior to the standard update sequence. The
    return value indicates whether the pre-update process completed successfully and
    whether the battleground should continue with its normal update cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter that may represent a time delta, update tick
      count, or other game state value. The exact meaning depends on the specific
      battleground implementation and context in which this method is called.
  returns: Returns true if the pre-update logic completed successfully and the battleground
    should proceed with normal processing; returns false if an error occurred or if
    the update cycle should be skipped.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom battleground
    code: "class MyBattleground : public Battleground {\npublic:\n    bool PreUpdateImpl(int\
      \ param0) override {\n        // Perform pre-update checks\n        if (!Battleground::PreUpdateImpl(param0))\n\
      \            return false;\n        \n        // Custom pre-update logic here\n\
      \        HandlePlayerUpdates();\n        \n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground update lifecycle and should not be
    called directly by external code. It's typically invoked internally by the game
    loop during battleground processing. The param0 parameter may vary depending on
    how often the battleground updates and what timing information is relevant to
    the specific battleground type.
  warnings: Direct invocation of PreUpdateImpl outside of the normal update cycle
    can lead to undefined behavior or game state corruption. Ensure that any custom
    implementations properly chain to the base class implementation when necessary.
