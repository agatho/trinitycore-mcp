  class: Channel

  signature: void Channel::Password(const Player * player, const std::string & pass)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the password for a channel.
  description: The Password method is used to assign or modify the password required
    to join a specific chat channel. This functionality is typically invoked when
    a player creates a channel or changes its security settings. The method takes
    a player reference and a password string, validates the input, and applies the
    password to the channel. It ensures that only players who know the password can
    join the channel, providing a basic level of access control for private communications.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object initiating the password change. This
      player must have sufficient permissions to modify the channel's password settings.
  - name: pass
    description: The new password string to be set for the channel. Must be a valid
      non-empty string with appropriate length restrictions as defined by the game's
      configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Channel Password
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"MyPrivateChannel\", player);\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->Password(player, \"Secret123\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's channel management system and relies
    on internal channel state tracking. The password is stored in memory and may be
    persisted to the database depending on server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the player has proper permissions before calling this method,
    as unauthorized access changes could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected
    behavior in channel operations.
