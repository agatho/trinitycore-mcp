documentation:
  brief: Processes a suspend token response packet from the client.
  description: The HandleSuspendTokenResponse method is responsible for handling incoming
    suspend token responses sent by the client. This method typically processes authentication
    or session-related tokens that are used to manage player sessions and validate
    client connectivity. The implementation likely verifies the token's integrity,
    updates session state, and may trigger further actions such as resuming gameplay
    or handling session timeouts. This method is part of the WorldSession class which
    manages all aspects of a player's connection to the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSuspendTokenResponse(WorldPackets::Movement::SuspendTokenResponse\
      \ & suspendTokenResponse)\n{\n    // Process the suspend token response\n  \
      \  // Validate token and update session state\n    // Handle any necessary follow-up\
      \ actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the packet handling pipeline when
    a SuspendTokenResponse packet is received from a client. The method should not
    block or perform heavy operations as it's called on the network thread. Session
    state management and token validation are critical aspects of this implementation.
  warnings: Improper handling of suspend tokens can lead to session instability or
    security vulnerabilities. Ensure proper token validation and avoid performing
    blocking operations within this method.
