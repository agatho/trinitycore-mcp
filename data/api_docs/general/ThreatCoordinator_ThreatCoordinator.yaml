  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ThreatCoordinator
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::ThreatCoordinator(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the threat coordinator with a specified group for managing threat
    distribution among group members.
  description: The ThreatCoordinator constructor initializes a threat management system
    for a given group. This method sets up internal tracking structures to monitor
    and distribute threat levels among group members, ensuring that mobs focus their
    attacks appropriately based on the defined threat hierarchy. It is typically called
    when a new group needs to be established or when a group's composition changes
    significantly. The system manages how threat is generated, transferred, and maintained
    across group members during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Threat Coordinator for a Group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      ThreatCoordinator coordinator(myGroup);

      // Threat coordinator is now initialized with the group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per group instance to avoid conflicts
    in threat tracking. The constructor assumes that the provided Group pointer is
    valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this constructor multiple times on the same group without proper
    cleanup may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that the Group
    object remains valid throughout the lifetime of the ThreatCoordinator.
