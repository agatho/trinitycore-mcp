  class: Player
  method: SetVirtualPlayerRealm
  signature: void Player::SetVirtualPlayerRealm(uint32 virtualRealmAddress)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the virtual realm address for the player, allowing the player to be
    associated with a specific virtual realm.
  description: The SetVirtualPlayerRealm method assigns a virtual realm address to
    a player object, which is used in World of Warcraft's virtual realm system. This
    allows players to be associated with a specific realm within the game's virtual
    environment, typically used for handling player data and communication across
    different realms or servers. The method is part of the Player class and affects
    how the player interacts with virtual realm systems in TrinityCore. It does not
    return any value but modifies the internal state of the player object.
  parameters:
  - name: virtualRealmAddress
    description: The virtual realm address to assign to the player. This is typically
      a uint32 value representing the realm ID or identifier used in virtual realm
      communication.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetVirtualPlayerRealm(12345);

      // The player is now associated with virtual realm 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other virtual realm-related
    methods and may affect how player data is handled across different servers or
    realms. It should be used carefully as it can influence player behavior in virtual
    environments.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to incorrect player data handling,
    especially when dealing with virtual realm communication or server-specific data.
    Care should be taken when setting the virtual realm address to ensure compatibility
    with existing game mechanics.
