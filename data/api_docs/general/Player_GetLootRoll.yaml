  class: Player
  method: GetLootRoll
  signature: LootRoll * Player::GetLootRoll(const int & lootObjectGuid, uint8 lootListId)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot roll object for a specific loot list associated with a player.
  description: This method retrieves the LootRoll object corresponding to a specific
    loot list ID from a player's loot system. It allows access to the current loot
    roll information for a given loot list, enabling developers to interact with the
    loot mechanics of the player. The method is typically used in conjunction with
    loot-related events and can be called during various stages of loot processing,
    such as when a player rolls on loot or when the system needs to retrieve specific
    loot data for processing.
  parameters:
  - name: lootObjectGuid
    description: The GUID of the loot object associated with the player. This parameter
      typically refers to the GUID of an item or object that is being rolled on.
  - name: lootListId
    description: The identifier for a specific loot list within the player's loot
      system. This value determines which loot list to retrieve the roll information
      from.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the LootRoll object associated with the specified
    loot list ID and loot object GUID. If no valid loot roll exists for the given
    parameters, it returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "LootRoll* lr = player->GetLootRoll(12345, 1);\nif (lr != nullptr) {\n \
      \   // Process the loot roll\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot system and should be used carefully
    to avoid issues with thread safety. It may return null if no valid loot roll exists
    for the specified parameters, so developers should always check for nullptr before
    using the returned object.
  warnings: This method can potentially lead to memory issues or crashes if not used
    correctly. Developers must ensure that the lootObjectGuid and lootListId are valid
    and properly initialized before calling this method. Also, calling this method
    during a loot processing event may cause race conditions if not handled carefully.
