  method: IsWorldObject
  signature: bool Object::IsWorldObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the object is a world object, returning true if the object
    exists in the world.
  description: The IsWorldObject method checks if the current Object instance represents
    a world object within the TrinityCore framework. This method is used to distinguish
    between objects that exist in the game world (such as players, creatures, or game
    objects) and those that are part of the internal object hierarchy but not directly
    accessible in the world context. It returns true when the object has a valid world
    presence, indicating it can be interacted with in the game environment. This method
    is essential for determining object visibility and interaction capabilities within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object is a world object, false otherwise. A world
    object typically means the object has been added to the world and can be interacted
    with by players or other world objects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (obj->IsWorldObject()) {\n    // Object is a world object\n    // Perform\
      \ world-specific operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other object-related methods
    to determine object state and visibility. It's important to note that objects
    may be in a world context but not necessarily have valid world presence if they
    haven't been properly initialized or added to the world.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator of object validity,
    as it only checks for world presence. Objects might be valid but not yet added
    to the world, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about their interaction
    capabilities.
