documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID of a player in the battleground.
  description: The GetPlayerTeam method retrieves the team identifier (either TEAM_ALLIANCE
    or TEAM_HORDE) for a specified player within the battleground context. This method
    is commonly used during battleground operations to determine which faction a player
    belongs to, particularly when handling scoring, rewards, or team-based gameplay
    mechanics. The method takes a player's GUID as input and returns the corresponding
    team ID if the player is part of the battleground; otherwise, it may return an
    invalid value or trigger an assertion in debug builds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the team ID of the specified player. Typically,
    this will be either TEAM_ALLIANCE (0) or TEAM_HORDE (1). If the player is not
    found in the battleground or the method fails to resolve the GUID, it may return
    -1 or trigger an assertion in debug builds.
  examples:
  - title: Check Player Team in Battleground
    code: "int playerTeam = bg->GetPlayerTeam(playerGuid);\nif (playerTeam == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle alliance player logic\n}\nelse if (playerTeam == TEAM_HORDE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle horde player logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid player
    currently participating in the battleground. It is recommended to verify the player's
    presence in the battleground before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior
    or assertions.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of a battleground context, as it may lead
    to undefined behavior or assertion failures if the player is not properly registered
    with the battleground instance.
