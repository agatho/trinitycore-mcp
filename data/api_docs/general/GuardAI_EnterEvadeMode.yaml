documentation:
  brief: Places the guard AI into evade mode, causing the guard to return to its initial
    position and stop attacking.
  description: The EnterEvadeMode method is used by the GuardAI class to transition
    a guard creature into evade mode. When invoked, this method causes the guard to
    cease all combat activities, return to its original spawn position, and reset
    its AI state. This typically occurs when the guard's target becomes unreachable,
    when the guard has been defeated, or when specific game conditions are met that
    require the guard to retreat. The method ensures proper cleanup of combat-related
    AI states and resets the guard's movement behavior to idle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event
    code: "void OnCombatEnd(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (me->GetAI())\n    {\n      \
      \  me->GetAI()->EnterEvadeMode();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally calls the base AI's evade mode logic and may trigger
    additional events such as resetting the guard's aggro list and clearing any active
    spell casts. The guard will automatically return to its spawn point if it has
    one, otherwise it will stop moving and become idle.
  warnings: Calling EnterEvadeMode while the guard is already in evade mode or during
    a critical combat sequence may cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that this method
    is only called when the guard should legitimately retreat from combat.
