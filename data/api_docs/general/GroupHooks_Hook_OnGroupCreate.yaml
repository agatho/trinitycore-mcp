  method: Hook_OnGroupCreate
  signature: void GroupHooks::Hook_OnGroupCreate(Group * group, Player * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a new group is created in the game world, allowing custom logic
    to be executed.
  description: The Hook_OnGroupCreate method is a callback function that gets triggered
    whenever a new player group (party) is formed in TrinityCore. This hook allows
    developers to inject custom behavior or modifications when groups are created,
    such as initializing group-specific data, applying buffs, or logging group creation
    events. The method receives the newly created Group object and the Player who
    becomes the leader of that group. It is typically used within custom modules or
    addons to extend default group functionality without modifying core game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the newly created Group object representing the party
      being formed. This parameter provides access to all group members, loot settings,
      and other group-related properties.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object who becomes the leader of the new group.
      This player is typically the first member added to the group or the one who
      initiated the group creation process.
  returns: null

    code: "void MyMod::Hook_OnGroupCreate(Group* group, Player* leader)\n{\n    //\
      \ Log group creation\n    sLog->outString(\"New group created with leader: %s\"\
      , leader->GetName().c_str());\n    \n    // Add custom initialization logic\
      \ here\n    // For example, set default loot settings or apply a group buff\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Group Creation Hook with Member Tracking
    code: "void MyMod::Hook_OnGroupCreate(Group* group, Player* leader)\n{\n    //\
      \ Store group information for later reference\n    GroupInfo info;\n    info.leaderGuid\
      \ = leader->GetGUID();\n    info.creationTime = time(nullptr);\n    \n    //\
      \ Iterate through all members and perform actions\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n         itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n    {\n        Player* member = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \        if (member)\n        {\n            // Apply a custom buff or modify\
      \ player state\n            member->CastSpell(member, 12345, true); // Example\
      \ spell ID\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Save group info to database or cache\n\
      \    m_groupInfos[group->GetGUIDLow()] = info;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This hook is called synchronously during the group creation process, so any
    heavy computation should be avoided to prevent performance degradation. The Group
    object passed in may not yet be fully initialized with all members, especially
    if it's a new party being formed. Be cautious when modifying the group structure
    directly from this hook as it might interfere with core game mechanics.
  warnings: Modifying or deleting the Group object within this hook can cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Avoid performing operations that depend on the group being
    fully populated before this hook is called, since some members may not be initialized
    yet. Also, ensure thread safety if your implementation accesses shared resources.
