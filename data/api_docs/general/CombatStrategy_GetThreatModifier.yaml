  brief: Returns the current threat modifier value used in combat calculations
  description: The GetThreatModifier method retrieves the threat modifier applied
    to threat generation and modification calculations within the CombatStrategy system.
    This value influences how much threat a player or creature generates when attacking
    targets, and how threat is modified by various abilities, talents, or environmental
    factors. The returned float value typically represents a multiplicative factor
    that scales threat values, with 1.0 indicating no modifier, values greater than
    1.0 increasing threat generation, and values less than 1.0 reducing it. This method
    is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to determine optimal combat behavior
    based on current threat levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current threat modifier. Values typically
    range from 0.0 (no threat generation) to positive values, with 1.0 indicating
    normal threat generation. Negative values or zero may indicate special combat
    states or disabled threat mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Modifier Retrieval
    code: "float modifier = combatStrategy->GetThreatModifier();\nif (modifier > 1.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Player is generating increased threat\n    sLog->outString(\"Increased\
      \ threat generation active: %.2f\", modifier);\n}\nelse if (modifier < 1.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Player is generating reduced threat\n    sLog->outString(\"Reduced\
      \ threat generation active: %.2f\", modifier);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Threat Modifier in Combat Decision Making
    code: "float threatMod = combatStrategy->GetThreatModifier();\nif (threatMod >\
      \ 1.5f)\n{\n    // Apply defensive abilities or switch targets\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_DEFENSIVE_STANCE, true);\n}\nelse if (threatMod < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Consider\
      \ switching to more aggressive tactics\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BERSERK,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state updates and may return
    cached values for performance reasons. The threat modifier can be influenced by
    various factors including player talents, buffs/debuffs, combat stance, and special
    abilities. Developers should be aware that the value returned may change dynamically
    during combat based on game events.
  warnings: The threat modifier value may not reflect real-time changes immediately
    due to caching mechanisms. Always verify the current combat state before relying
    on this value for critical AI decisions. In some edge cases, this method might
    return unexpected values if called outside of proper combat context.
