  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetArenaBracket
  signature: ArenaBracket ArenaAI::GetArenaBracket(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the arena bracket type for the player associated with the given
    GUID.
  description: The GetArenaBracket method determines and returns the specific arena
    bracket (such as 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5) that a player is participating in. This method
    is typically used within the ArenaAI system to manage player matchmaking and team
    composition during arena battles. The bracket type influences gameplay mechanics
    such as reward distribution, team balancing, and stat scaling. It's important
    to note that this method requires a valid player GUID to function correctly and
    will return an appropriate bracket value based on the player's current arena team
    membership.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is essential for identifying which player's arena bracket
      should be retrieved.
  returns: Returns an ArenaBracket enum value indicating the specific bracket type
    the player is participating in. Possible values include ARENA_BRACKET_2v2, ARENA_BRACKET_3v3,
    and ARENA_BRACKET_5v5.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint64 playerGuid = 12345;\nArenaBracket bracket = arenaAI->GetArenaBracket(&playerGuid);\n\
      if (bracket == ARENA_BRACKET_3v3)\n{\n    // Handle 3v3 arena logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bracket Type for Team Assignment
    code: "uint64 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();\nArenaBracket bracket = arenaAI->GetArenaBracket(&playerGuid);\n\
      switch (bracket)\n{\n    case ARENA_BRACKET_2v2:\n        // Assign to 2v2 team\n\
      \        break;\n    case ARENA_BRACKET_3v3:\n        // Assign to 3v3 team\n\
      \        break;\n    case ARENA_BRACKET_5v5:\n        // Assign to 5v5 team\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ArenaAI system and assumes that the player is
    currently registered in an arena team. The method may return invalid or default
    bracket values if the player is not properly initialized within the arena system.
    Performance-wise, this method should be called sparingly during active gameplay
    to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to a currently logged-in player; otherwise, the returned bracket value may be
    undefined or incorrect. This method does not validate whether the player is actually
    in an arena match, only their registered bracket type.
