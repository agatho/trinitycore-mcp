  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: EnhancedBotAI
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::EnhancedBotAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EnhancedBotAI instance with the specified player bot.
  description: The EnhancedBotAI constructor initializes a new artificial intelligence
    instance for a player bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up
    the internal state and configuration necessary for the bot to function as an enhanced
    AI character, including initializing behavior patterns, action queues, and interaction
    protocols. The constructor typically expects a valid Player object representing
    the bot character that will be controlled by this AI implementation. It establishes
    the foundational structure required for the bot to perform intelligent actions
    such as movement, combat decisions, and quest behavior within the World of Warcraft
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      this AI instance will control. Must be a valid non-null pointer to an initialized
      Player object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = new Player();

      // ... initialize bot properties ...

      EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Bot with Existing Player
    code: "Player* existingBot = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));\n\
      if (existingBot)\n{\n    EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI(existingBot);\n\
      \    // Bot AI is now ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The Player
    object passed must already be properly initialized in the game world with valid
    data, including character stats, inventory, and position information. The AI system
    assumes that the player object is fully constructed before this constructor is
    invoked.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is properly created and registered
    in the game world before constructing EnhancedBotAI. Avoid calling this constructor
    multiple times on the same bot instance as it may lead to memory leaks or inconsistent
    AI states.
