  class: GuildBankManager
  method: GetMemberBankProfile
  signature: MemberBankProfile GuildBankManager::GetMemberBankProfile(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bank profile data for a specific guild member by their player
    GUID.
  description: The GetMemberBankProfile method fetches the complete bank profile information
    associated with a given player's GUID within the guild banking system. This includes
    details such as the member's allowed withdraw and deposit limits, permissions,
    and any custom settings configured for their access to the guild bank. The method
    is typically used when checking or updating a guild member's banking privileges
    or retrieving their current banking status. It assumes that the player is a valid
    guild member and that the guild bank system has been properly initialized. If
    no profile exists for the specified GUID, the method may return a default or empty
    profile structure.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild bank profile
      is being retrieved. This value must correspond to an existing guild member in
      the current guild.
  returns: A MemberBankProfile object containing the complete banking configuration
    for the specified player, including permissions, limits, and access settings.
    Returns a default or empty profile if no data exists for the given GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Guild Member's Bank Profile
    code: "uint32 memberId = 12345;\nMemberBankProfile profile = guildBankManager->GetMemberBankProfile(memberId);\n\
      if (!profile.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Process the retrieved profile data\n    printf(\"\
      Withdraw Limit: %u\\n\", profile.WithdrawLimit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database lookups or cached data retrieval, so
    performance should be considered when calling it frequently. The returned MemberBankProfile
    object may be mutable and changes could affect the actual guild bank settings
    if saved back to storage.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an actual member of
    the guild; otherwise, the behavior is undefined or may return an invalid profile.
    This method should not be called outside of a valid guild context where the GuildBankManager
    instance is properly initialized.
