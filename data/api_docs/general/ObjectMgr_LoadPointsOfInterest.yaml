documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes points of interest data from the database into memory
    for use in the game world.
  description: The LoadPointsOfInterest method retrieves all defined points of interest
    (POIs) from the database tables and populates internal data structures used by
    the game client to display quest markers, landmarks, and other interactive locations.
    This method is typically called during server startup or map loading processes
    to ensure that all POI information is available for player interaction. It handles
    parsing of coordinates, icons, and associated quest data necessary for proper
    display in the minimap and world map interfaces.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadPointsOfInterest();\n\
      \    // ... other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's initialization sequence and should
    only be called once during server startup. The loaded POI data is cached in memory
    for fast access during gameplay, so subsequent calls will not reload the data
    unless explicitly requested through other mechanisms.
