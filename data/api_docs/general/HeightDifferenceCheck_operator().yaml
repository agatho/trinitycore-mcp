  class: HeightDifferenceCheck
  method: operator()
  signature: bool HeightDifferenceCheck::operator()(int * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the height difference between two points meets the specified criteria.
  description: The HeightDifferenceCheck::operator() method evaluates whether the
    vertical distance between a unit's current position and a target location satisfies
    certain conditions. This is commonly used in AI pathfinding and movement logic
    to ensure units can navigate terrain properly, especially when dealing with elevation
    changes. The method takes a pointer to an int representing a unit and performs
    calculations to determine if the height difference is acceptable for the given
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to an integer representing a unit in the game world. This
      typically points to a unit's identifier or memory location used for height difference
      calculations.
  returns: Returns true if the height difference meets the criteria defined by the
    check, false otherwise. The exact threshold and behavior depend on the implementation
    details of the HeightDifferenceCheck class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI pathfinding
    code: "HeightDifferenceCheck checker;\nint* unitPtr = &someUnitId;\nbool isValid\
      \ = checker(unitPtr);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for handling terrain navigation
    in TrinityCore. It may be used in conjunction with other checks like line-of-sight
    or collision detection to ensure realistic unit movement.
