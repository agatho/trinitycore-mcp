  class: MovementIntegration
  method: GetTargetPosition
  signature: int MovementIntegration::GetTargetPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current target position for movement integration.
  description: The GetTargetPosition method returns an integer identifier representing
    the current target position used in movement integration logic. This method is
    typically utilized by AI systems or movement controllers to determine where a
    unit should move next. The returned value usually corresponds to a specific location
    within the game world, often represented as a unique coordinate or node identifier.
    The method does not perform any side effects and is generally called during movement
    update cycles to fetch the latest target coordinates.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current target position identifier. This value
    typically corresponds to a specific location in the game world, such as a waypoint
    index or coordinate set. A return value of -1 may indicate an invalid or unset
    target position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement update
    code: "void MovementIntegration::Update()\n{\n    int targetPos = GetTargetPosition();\n\
      \    if (targetPos >= 0)\n    {\n        // Proceed with movement to target\
      \ position\n        MoveToPosition(targetPos);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called frequently during movement updates,
    so performance should be considered. The returned value may change dynamically
    based on AI decisions or external events.
  warnings: Ensure that the target position is valid before using it for movement
    operations. Invalid return values (e.g., -1) should be handled gracefully to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
