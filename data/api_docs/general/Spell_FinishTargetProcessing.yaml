documentation:
  brief: Completes target processing for the spell, finalizing target effects and
    cleanup.
  description: The FinishTargetProcessing method is responsible for completing the
    target processing phase of a spell's execution. This method typically handles
    the finalization of target-related effects, cleans up temporary data structures,
    and ensures that all target-specific spell mechanics are properly concluded. It
    is usually called after all target effects have been applied and before the spell
    transitions to its completion state. The method may also handle cleanup of any
    temporary references or state information associated with spell targets.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell execution
    code: "void MySpell::Execute()\n{\n    // ... spell preparation and target selection\
      \ ...\n    CastSpell();\n    FinishTargetProcessing(); // Finalize target processing\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system during spell
    execution flow. Developers should not generally need to call this directly unless
    implementing custom spell behavior. The method may perform cleanup operations
    that are essential for proper memory management and spell state consistency.
