documentation:
  brief: Handles swapping an item from the player's inventory with an item in the
    guild bank.
  description: This method processes a client request to swap an item located in the
    player's inventory with an item stored in the guild bank. It validates that both
    the player and the guild are valid, checks if the player has permission to access
    the guild bank, verifies that the items exist at their respective locations, and
    ensures the transaction adheres to game rules such as slot restrictions and item
    compatibility. The method performs necessary updates to both the player's inventory
    and the guild bank storage, and sends appropriate responses back to the client
    indicating success or failure of the operation.

      \ swapItemWithGuildBankItem)\n{\n    // This method is called when a player\
      \ attempts to swap an item from their inventory\n    // with an item in the\
      \ guild bank through the client UI.\n    // The actual implementation handles\
      \ validation and data synchronization.\n}"

  notes: The method assumes that all necessary preconditions have been checked by
    the calling code, including session validity, player login status, and guild membership.
    It is typically invoked as part of a larger packet handling chain within the WorldSession
