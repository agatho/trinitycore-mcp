  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: TravelToFarmingZone
  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::TravelToFarmingZone(int * player, const FarmingZoneInfo
    & zone)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates travel to a specified farming zone for the given player.
  description: The TravelToFarmingZone method handles the process of moving a player
    character to a designated farming zone within the game world. This method is typically
    used in automation scripts or questing systems where players need to be transported
    efficiently between different zones for resource gathering or farming activities.
    It manages the necessary travel mechanics including pathfinding, teleportation,
    and zone transition logic. The method requires a valid player reference and a
    properly configured farming zone definition to execute successfully.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that will be transported to the farming
      zone. Must not be null and must represent a valid active player character in
      the game world.
  - name: zone
    description: Reference to a FarmingZoneInfo structure containing all necessary
      information about the target farming zone, including location coordinates, zone
      ID, and any special travel requirements or restrictions.
  returns: Returns true if the travel operation was initiated successfully and the
    player is being moved to the specified farming zone. Returns false if the operation
    failed due to invalid parameters, unreachable destination, or other system errors
    during the travel process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "FarmingZoneInfo zone;\nzone.zoneId = 1234;\nzone.x = 100.0f;\nzone.y =\
      \ 200.0f;\nzone.z = 50.0f;\nPlayer* player = ...; // valid player reference\n\
      bool success = coordinator->TravelToFarmingZone(&player, zone);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Travel initiated successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle travel failure\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "FarmingZoneInfo zone;\nzone.zoneId = 5678;\nzone.x = 1500.0f;\nzone.y =\
      \ 2500.0f;\nzone.z = 300.0f;\nPlayer* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(...);\
      \ // Find player by GUID\nif (player && !player->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Player\
      \ not in world, cannot travel\n    return false;\n}\nbool result = coordinator->TravelToFarmingZone(&player,\
      \ zone);\nswitch(result) {\n    case true:\n        // Travel started successfully\n\
      \        break;\n    case false:\n        // Check for specific error conditions\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Failed to initiate travel to farming zone %u\", zone.zoneId);\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex pathfinding and teleportation logic that
    could impact performance if called frequently. The implementation likely uses
    internal navigation systems and may trigger zone update events. It's recommended
    to validate the player's state before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure the FarmingZoneInfo structure contains valid coordinates
    and zone identifiers before invoking this method. The method may not work correctly
    if the target zone is inaccessible or if the player is in an invalid state (e.g.,
    dead, in combat).
