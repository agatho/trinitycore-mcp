  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: GenerateJumpOver
  signature: AvoidanceManeuver ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateJumpOver(const CollisionPrediction
    & collision)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a jump-over avoidance maneuver when a collision is predicted.
  description: The GenerateJumpOver method computes and returns an AvoidanceManeuver
    object that represents a jump-over action to avoid an impending collision. This
    method is typically invoked by the AI system when obstacle detection logic determines
    that a unit needs to perform a jump to safely navigate around an obstacle. The
    maneuver includes parameters such as jump height, duration, and target position.
    It assumes that the input CollisionPrediction has already been computed and validated.
    This method does not modify the state of the collision prediction object but rather
    uses it to determine the appropriate avoidance behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AvoidanceManeuver object representing a jump-over action to avoid the
    predicted collision. The maneuver includes timing, position, and movement parameters
    necessary for executing the avoidance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (CollisionPrediction* collision = m_obstacleManager->CheckForCollisions())\n\
      \    {\n        AvoidanceManeuver maneuver = m_obstacleManager->GenerateJumpOver(*collision);\n\
      \        ExecuteManeuver(maneuver);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the obstacle avoidance system and should only be called
    when a valid collision prediction exists. The jump-over maneuver may not be suitable
    for all types of obstacles or unit movement capabilities. Performance depends
    on the complexity of the collision prediction data.
  warnings: Ensure that the input CollisionPrediction object is valid before calling
    this method, as invalid data could lead to incorrect avoidance maneuvers. This
    method does not perform any collision detection itself; it only generates a maneuver
    based on precomputed predictions.
