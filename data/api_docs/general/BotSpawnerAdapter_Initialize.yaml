  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotSpawnerAdapter::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot spawner adapter, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for bot spawning operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotSpawnerAdapter class for use
    by initializing internal data members, loading configuration settings, and establishing
    necessary connections or resources required for spawning game bots. This method
    should be called once during system startup or when the adapter needs to be reinitialized.
    It performs essential setup tasks such as validating configuration parameters,
    allocating memory for bot data structures, and ensuring all dependent systems
    are ready. The method returns true upon successful initialization, or false if
    any critical error occurs during setup. This is a prerequisite step before any
    bot spawning operations can be performed through this adapter.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all internal components
    were properly set up; returns false if an error occurred during initialization,
    such as missing configuration data or failed resource allocation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;\nbool success = adapter.Initialize();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning operations\n    std::cout << \"Bot spawner\
      \ initialized successfully\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to initialize bot spawner\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotSpawnerAdapter
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process may involve disk I/O operations for loading configuration
    files and could block execution until complete.
  warnings: Do not call this method after bot spawning operations have begun, as it
    may invalidate existing bot data structures. Ensure that all required configuration
    files are present before calling Initialize to avoid silent failures.
