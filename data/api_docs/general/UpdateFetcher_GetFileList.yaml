  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: GetFileList
  signature: LocaleFileStorage UpdateFetcher::GetFileList() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the complete list of locale-specific files managed by the UpdateFetcher
    instance.
  description: The GetFileList method returns a LocaleFileStorage object containing
    all locale-specific files that are tracked or managed by this UpdateFetcher instance.
    This method is typically used during game data synchronization processes where
    the system needs to know which localized files are available for updates or validation.
    The returned LocaleFileStorage object encapsulates file metadata including paths,
    locales, and potentially version information for each file. This method does not
    modify any internal state of the UpdateFetcher and is safe to call multiple times.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with update validation routines and localization
    management systems within TrinityCore's data handling framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LocaleFileStorage object containing all locale-specific files managed
    by this UpdateFetcher instance. The storage object typically includes file paths,
    associated locales, and metadata necessary for tracking and managing localized
    game assets during updates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve all locale files
    code: "UpdateFetcher fetcher;\nLocaleFileStorage files = fetcher.GetFileList();\n\
      for (const auto& file : files)\n{\n    std::cout << \"File: \" << file.path\
      \ << \" Locale: \" << file.locale << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation and does not modify internal state.
    The LocaleFileStorage returned may be empty if no files have been added to the
    fetcher yet. This method is likely called during initialization or update cycles
    when the system needs to enumerate all available localized resources.
