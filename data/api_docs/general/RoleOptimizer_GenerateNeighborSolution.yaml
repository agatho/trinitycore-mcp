documentation:
  brief: Generates a neighboring role solution for player assignment optimization
  description: The GenerateNeighborSolution method computes an optimal role distribution
    for a group of players by evaluating neighboring possible assignments. This method
    is typically used in group content such as raids or dungeons where proper role
    allocation (tank, healer, damage dealer) maximizes efficiency and success probability.
    It takes into account the current player configuration and generates a new solution
    based on neighbor evaluation techniques. The method returns an integer representing
    the quality or fitness of the generated solution, with higher values indicating
    better role assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: current
    description: The index or identifier of the current player configuration being
      evaluated
  - name: players
    description: The total number of players in the group for which the solution is
      being generated
  returns: An integer value representing the fitness score of the generated neighbor
    solution. Higher values indicate better role assignments, while lower or negative
    values may suggest suboptimal configurations or errors during evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group optimization
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint current = 0;\nint playerCount = 5;\nint solution\
      \ = optimizer.GenerateNeighborSolution(current, playerCount);\nif (solution\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Optimal role assignment generated with score: \"\
      \ << solution << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to generate\
      \ valid solution\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterative optimization loop
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nint current = 0;\nint players = 8;\nint bestSolution\
      \ = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {\n    int newSolution = optimizer.GenerateNeighborSolution(current,\
      \ players);\n    if (newSolution > bestSolution) {\n        bestSolution = newSolution;\n\
      \        current = i;\n    }\n}\nstd::cout << \"Best solution score: \" << bestSolution\
      \ << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger optimization framework used in TrinityCore's
    group management system. It performs neighbor-based search operations to find
    improved role assignments, which can be computationally intensive for large groups.
    The implementation likely uses heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated
    annealing or genetic algorithms.
  warnings: The method may return negative values indicating invalid solutions or
    computational errors. Ensure that player counts are valid and positive before
    calling this method. In performance-critical scenarios, consider caching results
    to avoid repeated computations for identical inputs.
