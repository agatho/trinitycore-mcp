  brief: Initializes the motion master for a unit, setting up movement behavior and
    pathfinding capabilities.
  description: The MotionMaster constructor initializes the movement system for a
    Unit object, establishing the foundation for pathfinding and movement behaviors.
    It sets up the necessary components to handle various movement types including
    waypoint-based movement, random movement, and targeted movement. This method is
    crucial for enabling NPCs and players to navigate through the game world effectively,
    ensuring proper movement handling during combat, movement, and other gameplay

  notes: This constructor typically initializes the motion system with default movement
    types and pathfinding capabilities. The actual implementation details may vary
    based on whether the unit is a player or NPC, with different movement behaviors
    being set up accordingly.
