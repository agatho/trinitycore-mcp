  class: Battleground
  method: HandleKillUnit
  signature: void Battleground::HandleKillUnit(Creature * param0, Unit * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the death of a creature unit within a battleground, updating player
    scores and battleground state accordingly.
  description: The HandleKillUnit method is responsible for processing the event when
    a creature unit is killed during a battleground match. This method typically updates
    player statistics, awards points or honor to the killer's team, and may trigger
    additional battleground-specific logic such as flag captures or objective completions.
    It ensures that the game state remains consistent with the rules of the specific
    battleground type being played. The method takes into account the killer unit
    and the killed creature to determine appropriate scoring and state changes.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that was killed during the battleground
      event.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that caused the death of the creature
      (the killer).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground event handling
    code: "void MyBattleground::OnCreatureKilled(Creature* killedCreature, Unit* killer)\
      \ {\n    HandleKillUnit(killedCreature, killer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom scoring logic
    code: "void AdvancedBattleground::HandleKillUnit(Creature* creature, Unit* killer)\
      \ {\n    // Custom logic before calling base method\n    if (killer && killer->IsPlayer())\
      \ {\n        Player* player = killer->ToPlayer();\n        player->AddHonorPoints(100);\n\
      \    }\n    // Call parent implementation\n    Battleground::HandleKillUnit(creature,\
      \ killer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the battleground system when
    a creature dies. Developers should ensure that any overrides of this method properly
    handle null pointers and maintain synchronization with the overall battleground
    state. The method may be called from different threads depending on how the battleground
    system processes events.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain about the context
    and parameters. Incorrect usage can lead to inconsistent game state or scoring
    errors. Ensure that both parameters are valid pointers before calling, as null
    pointer dereferences may occur if not properly validated.
