  class: LootDistribution
  method: CachePlayerEquipment
  signature: void LootDistribution::CachePlayerEquipment(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Caches the equipment of a player for loot distribution purposes.
  description: The CachePlayerEquipment method stores a player's current equipment
    in memory for use during loot distribution processes. This allows the system to
    quickly reference a player's gear without repeatedly querying the database or
    performing expensive calculations. The cached data typically includes item IDs,
    slot information, and possibly enchantment details relevant to loot eligibility
    and distribution mechanics. This method is usually invoked when a player joins
    a loot group or when loot distribution begins to ensure all participants' equipment
    is up-to-date.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution
    code: "void HandleLootDistribution(Player* player)\n{\n    LootDistribution lootDist;\n\
      \    lootDist.CachePlayerEquipment(player);\n    // Proceed with loot distribution\
      \ logic using cached equipment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs caching in a thread-safe manner, as loot distribution
    can occur concurrently. The cache may be invalidated or updated when the player's
    inventory changes during the loot process.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called before attempting to distribute loot
    to avoid using stale equipment data. Failure to cache properly might result in
    incorrect loot assignments based on outdated gear information.
