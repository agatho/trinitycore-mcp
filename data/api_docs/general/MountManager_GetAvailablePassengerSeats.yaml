  signature: uint32 MountManager::GetAvailablePassengerSeats(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available passenger seats for a player's mount.
  description: The GetAvailablePassengerSeats method retrieves the count of passenger
    seats currently available for a player's mount. This method is typically used
    in the context of vehicle-based gameplay mechanics within World of Warcraft, particularly
    when managing mount interactions and passenger capacity. The method takes a pointer
    to an integer representing the player and returns a uint32 value indicating how
    many additional passengers can board the mount. It is important to note that this
    method may consider various factors such as the current mount state, player permissions,
    and vehicle capacity limits.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier. This parameter
      should point to a valid player ID or GUID used internally by TrinityCore to
      identify the specific player whose available passenger seats are being queried.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available passenger seats for
    the specified player's mount. Returns 0 if no seats are available, or if the player
    does not have a valid mount. The return value may also be 0 if the mount is currently
    in an invalid state or if the player lacks proper permissions to access the mount.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 availableSeats = mountManager->GetAvailablePassengerSeats(&playerId);\n\
      if (availableSeats > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with mounting logic\n    printf(\"\
      Available seats: %u\\n\", availableSeats);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where\
      \ no seats are available\n    printf(\"No available passenger seats.\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 availableSeats = mountManager->GetAvailablePassengerSeats(&playerId);\n\
      \nif (availableSeats == 0)\n{\n    // Check if player has a valid mount\n  \
      \  if (!playerHasValidMount(playerId))\n    {\n        printf(\"Player does\
      \ not have a valid mount.\\n\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"\
      No passenger seats available on the mount.\\n\");\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with adding passengers or other logic\n    printf(\"Mount has %u available\
      \ passenger seats.\\n\", availableSeats);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger mount management system and may interact
    with internal vehicle states, player permissions, and mount configurations. The
    player parameter should be validated before calling this method to ensure it refers
    to a valid player entity. Performance-wise, this method should be relatively fast
    as it primarily involves checking cached mount state information.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an active player entity. Passing invalid or null pointers could lead to undefined
    behavior. Additionally, this method may return 0 in multiple scenarios (no mount,
    no seats, invalid state), so callers should distinguish between these cases if
    necessary.
