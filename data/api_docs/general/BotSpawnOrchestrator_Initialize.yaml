  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotSpawnOrchestrator::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot spawn orchestrator system, setting up required data structures
    and configurations for managing AI-controlled player characters.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotSpawnOrchestrator class for operation
    by loading necessary configuration settings, initializing internal data structures,
    and establishing connections or references needed for spawning and managing bot
    characters. This method typically performs setup tasks such as reading from database
    tables, allocating memory for bot instances, and validating that all required
    subsystems are available. It ensures the orchestrator is in a ready state before
    any bot spawning operations can be performed. The method should only be called
    once during the system's initialization phase, and subsequent calls may have no
    effect or return false if already initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; returns false if initialization failed due to missing dependencies,
    configuration errors, or other critical issues that prevent proper operation of
    the bot spawning system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;\nbool success = orchestrator.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Bot spawning system is ready for use\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      bot\", \"Bot spawn orchestrator initialized successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    // Handle initialization failure\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to\
      \ initialize bot spawn orchestrator.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when the bot system
    module is loaded. It's important that this method completes successfully before
    any bot-related operations are attempted. The initialization process may involve
    database queries and memory allocations, so it should not be called from performance-critical
    code paths.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup between calls
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that all previous bot
    instances are properly disposed of before calling this method again. This method
    should not be invoked while other threads are actively using the orchestrator.
