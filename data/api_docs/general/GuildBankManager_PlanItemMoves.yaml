  signature: int GuildBankManager::PlanItemMoves(int * guild, const BankOrganizationPlan
    & plan)
documentation:
  brief: Plans item movements for a guild bank organization based on a provided bank
    organization plan.
  description: The PlanItemMoves method calculates and prepares the necessary item
    movements within a guild's bank organization according to a specified BankOrganizationPlan.
    This method is typically used to optimize or reorganize guild bank inventory by
    determining which items should be moved, from where, and to where. It does not
    execute the moves directly but rather plans them for later execution. The method
    returns an integer indicating success or failure of the planning process, with
    positive values often representing successful planning and negative values indicating
    errors or failures in planning.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier (GUID) for
      which the item moves are being planned. This parameter identifies the specific
      guild's bank organization that will be affected by the plan.
  - name: plan
    description: Reference to a BankOrganizationPlan object containing the rules and
      specifications for how items should be organized within the guild bank. This
      includes information about item placement, slot preferences, and organizational
      strategies.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the outcome of the planning process.
    A positive return value typically indicates successful planning, while a negative
    value usually signifies an error or failure in planning. Specific values may vary
    depending on implementation details but generally follow standard error code conventions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nBankOrganizationPlan plan;\n// Configure the plan\
      \ with desired organization rules\nint result = guildBankManager.PlanItemMoves(&guildId,\
      \ plan);\nif (result > 0) {\n    // Planning was successful\n    printf(\"Item\
      \ moves planned successfully. Result: %d\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    // Planning\
      \ failed\n    printf(\"Failed to plan item moves. Error code: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nBankOrganizationPlan plan;\nplan.SetDesiredLayout(BankOrganizationPlan::LAYOUT_SORTED);\n\
      plan.SetItemPriority({ITEM_TYPE_ARMOR, ITEM_TYPE_WEAPON});\n\nint result = guildBankManager.PlanItemMoves(&guildId,\
      \ plan);\nswitch (result) {\n    case 0:\n        printf(\"No changes needed.\\\
      n\");\n        break;\n    case 1:\n        printf(\"Planning completed successfully\
      \ with 1 move planned.\\n\");\n        break;\n    default:\n        if (result\
      \ > 1) {\n            printf(\"Planning completed successfully with %d moves\
      \ planned.\\n\", result);\n        } else {\n            printf(\"Error during\
      \ planning: %d\\n\", result);\n        }\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild bank management system and should be used
    in conjunction with other methods like ExecutePlannedMoves to actually perform
    the planned item movements. The planning process may involve complex logic to
    determine optimal item placement, considering factors such as item type, quality,
    stack sizes, and existing inventory layout. It's recommended to call this method
    before attempting to execute moves to ensure that all planned operations are valid.
  warnings: The method does not perform actual item movement; it only plans them.
    Ensure that the BankOrganizationPlan is properly configured with valid rules before
    calling this method. Improperly configured plans may result in failed planning
    or unexpected behavior when executed later. This method should be called carefully
    as it might have performance implications on large guild banks.
