  brief: Invoked when a new group is created in the game world
  description: The OnGroupCreated method is a callback function that gets triggered
    whenever a new group (party) is formed in the World of Warcraft instance. This
    method allows integration modules to perform custom logic or modifications when
    groups are created, such as initializing group-specific data, applying buffs,
    or logging group creation events. The method receives a pointer to the newly created
    Group object which contains all relevant information about the group members and
    their state. It is typically used by addons, modules, or custom extensions to
    TrinityCore to extend default group behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "void GroupIntegration::OnGroupCreated(Group* group)\n{\n    if (!group)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Log group creation\n    sLog->outString(\"New\
      \ group created with %u members\", group->GetMembersCount());\n    \n    //\
      \ Apply custom logic to the group\n    for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n         itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n    {\n        Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \        if (player)\n            player->AddAura(12345, player); // Example\
      \ aura\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the group creation process, so it's important
    to ensure that any operations performed do not interfere with the group initialization.
    The Group object passed to this method may not yet be fully initialized in all
    aspects, particularly if other systems are still processing the group formation.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify or destroy the Group object directly within this
    callback as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, avoid performing
    heavy operations that could block the main thread during group creation.
