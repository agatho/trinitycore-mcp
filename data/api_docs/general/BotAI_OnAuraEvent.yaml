  signature: void BotAI::OnAuraEvent(const AuraEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Handles aura-related events for bot AI, processing changes in active auras.
  description: The OnAuraEvent method is a core callback function within the BotAI
    class that processes and responds to changes in aura states for bots. It is invoked
    whenever an aura is applied, removed, or modified on a bot character. This method
    allows the AI to react dynamically to status effects, buffs, debuffs, and other
    aura-based gameplay mechanics. The event parameter contains detailed information
    about the specific aura change that occurred, including the aura's type, duration,
    caster, and affected unit. This functionality is essential for implementing intelligent
    behavior in bot characters that respond appropriately to their changing magical
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to an AuraEvent object containing details about
      the aura change, including the aura type, caster, target, and event type (apply,
      remove, update).
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Aura Event Handling
    code: "void BotAI::OnAuraEvent(const AuraEvent& event)\n{\n    if (event.GetType()\
      \ == AURA_EVENT_APPLY)\n    {\n        // Handle aura application\n        if\
      \ (event.GetAuraType() == SPELL_AURA_MOD_INCREASE_SPEED)\n        {\n      \
      \      // Bot gains speed boost\n            m_bot->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 1.5f);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n    else if (event.GetType() == AURA_EVENT_REMOVE)\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle aura removal\n        if (event.GetAuraType() == SPELL_AURA_MOD_INCREASE_SPEED)\n\
      \        {\n            m_bot->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 1.0f);\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"

  notes: This method is typically called from the core TrinityCore aura system when
    an aura state changes. Developers should ensure that all aura-related logic within
    this method is efficient and does not introduce performance bottlenecks. The event
    object is read-only and should not be modified by the AI implementation.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations within this
    method as it may impact overall server performance. Do not modify the aura state
    directly from this handler; instead, use appropriate spell or action queues to
    manage changes.
