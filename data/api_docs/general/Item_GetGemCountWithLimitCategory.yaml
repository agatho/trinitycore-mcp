  method: GetGemCountWithLimitCategory
  signature: uint8 Item::GetGemCountWithLimitCategory(uint32 limitCategory) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of gems with a specific limit category on the item.
  description: This method retrieves the number of gems that are subject to a particular
    limit category on the item. It is used to determine how many gems of a given type
    are present on an item, which can be important for game mechanics such as gem
    limits, item upgrades, or crafting systems. The method operates on the item's
    gem data and returns a uint8 value representing the count of gems matching the
    specified limit category.
  parameters:
  - name: limitCategory
    description: The limit category to check for gems. This parameter defines which
      specific gem limit is being queried, typically related to gem types or restrictions
      such as level requirements or item type restrictions.
  returns: Represents the number of gems matching the specified limit category on
    the item. A value of 0 indicates no gems with that limit category are present,
    while higher values indicate multiple gems exist with that category.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint8 gemCount = item->GetGemCountWithLimitCategory(123); // Returns count
      of gems with limit category 123
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves internal data structures that store gem information,
    and may require careful handling when used in conjunction with other gem-related
    methods. Performance considerations may arise if this method is called frequently
    during item processing or crafting.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with different limit categories as
    it may not return accurate results if the item does not have gems associated with
    that category. Also, ensure that the limit category value is valid and corresponds
    to known gem limit types in the game.
