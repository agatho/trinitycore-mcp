  signature: void InstanceLock::SetExtended(bool extended)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the extended status flag of the instance lock.
  description: The SetExtended method configures whether the instance lock is in an
    extended state. This typically controls additional permissions or behaviors associated
    with the locked instance, such as allowing extended access to certain players
    or groups beyond the standard lock duration. The method directly modifies internal
    state flags within the InstanceLock object and does not return any value. It is
    commonly used during instance management operations where extended access needs
    to be granted or revoked.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an instance lock to extended mode
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();

      lock->SetExtended(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling extended mode for an instance lock
    code: 'InstanceLock* lock = player->GetInstanceLock();

      lock->SetExtended(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags and should only be called when
    the instance lock is in a valid state. The extended flag may affect how the instance
    behaves during player entry, exit, or reset operations.
