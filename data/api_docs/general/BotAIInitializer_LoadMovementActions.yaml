documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads movement actions for bot AI behavior.
  description: The LoadMovementActions method is responsible for setting up and configuring
    all movement-related actions that a bot AI will use during gameplay. This includes
    loading predefined movement patterns, pathfinding behaviors, and locomotion strategies
    that allow the bot to navigate the game world effectively. The method typically
    runs during the initialization phase of a bot's AI system and prepares the necessary
    data structures and action handlers required for movement execution. It ensures
    that bots can perform basic movements like walking, running, jumping, and following
    paths without requiring external input.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadMovementActions();

      // Movement actions are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the construction or initialization
    phase of a BotAI instance. It may load data from configuration files or internal
    databases, so performance could be affected if large datasets are involved. The
    method should only be called once per AI instance to avoid redundant loading operations.
