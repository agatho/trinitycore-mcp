  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: ShouldAOE
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::ShouldAOE()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current combat behavior should utilize area-of-effect
    abilities.
  description: The ShouldAOE method evaluates the current combat state and enemy positioning
    to decide if using area-of-effect spells or abilities is beneficial. This decision
    takes into account factors such as the number of nearby enemies, their proximity,
    and the AI's configured combat strategy. The method is typically used by AI-controlled
    units to optimize spell selection during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if area-of-effect abilities should be considered or used in
    the current combat situation; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision logic
    code: "if (combatBehavior->ShouldAOE()) {\n    // Execute AOE spell\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ AOE_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI combat state machine
    code: "void CombatBehaviorIntegration::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (ShouldAOE())\
      \ {\n        // Switch to AOE-focused strategy\n        SetCurrentStrategy(AOE_STRATEGY);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Continue with single-target approach\n        SetCurrentStrategy(SINGLE_TARGET_STRATEGY);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework and should be called
    frequently during combat updates. The implementation may consider unit type, spell
    availability, mana levels, and target distribution to make its determination.
  warnings: The method assumes that the AI context has been properly initialized with
    current enemy positions and combat state information. Calling this method without
    valid combat data may lead to incorrect decisions.
