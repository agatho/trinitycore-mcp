  class: Unit
  method: SetModHasteRegen
  signature: void Unit::SetModHasteRegen(float hasteRegen)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the haste regeneration modifier for the unit.
  description: This method modifies the haste regeneration rate of the Unit, which
    affects how quickly mana is regenerated over time. Haste regen represents the
    percentage change in mana regeneration speed, where positive values increase regeneration
    and negative values decrease it. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    involving mana regeneration, such as when applying buffs or debuffs that alter
    mana regeneration rates. The modification is applied directly to the unit's current
    haste regen value without affecting other attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: hasteRegen
    description: The percentage change in mana regeneration rate. Positive values
      increase regeneration speed, while negative values decrease it. This value is
      typically expressed as a decimal or percentage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetModHasteRegen(10.0f); // Increases haste regen by 10%

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetModHasteRegen(-5.0f); // Decreases haste regen by 5%

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the unit's current haste regen value, which
    may be affected by other factors such as buffs or debuffs. It should be used carefully
    in conjunction with other mana-related methods to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect mana regeneration rates,
    especially if applied without considering existing buffs or debuffs. Care should
    be taken when applying negative values to avoid unintended consequences.
