  signature: void ProtectionPaladinRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation(int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the single-target threat rotation for a Protection Paladin, managing
    ability usage and threat generation.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation method implements the core logic
    for a Protection Paladin's single-target combat rotation. This method determines
    which abilities to use based on current threat levels, target health, and resource
    availability. It manages the sequence of actions such as judging, shield slam,
    and other threat-generating abilities to maintain optimal threat positioning.
    The method typically operates within an AI framework where it evaluates the current
    state of the player and target to make tactical decisions. It is designed to be
    called during combat situations where the paladin needs to sustain consistent
    threat on a single enemy target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit that the rotation will be executed against.
      This parameter represents the current enemy target for which threat management
      is being performed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyPaladinAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetTarget())\n  \
      \  {\n        ExecuteSingleTargetThreatRotation(&target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the paladin is in combat and has a valid target.
    The implementation likely includes checks for ability cooldowns, mana requirements,
    and positioning. It may also integrate with threat management systems to ensure
    optimal threat distribution.
  warnings: The method requires that the target parameter points to a valid Unit object;
    otherwise, it will cause undefined behavior. Ensure proper null checking before
    calling this method in production code.
