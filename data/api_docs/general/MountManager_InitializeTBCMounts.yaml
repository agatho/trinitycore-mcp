  signature: void MountManager::InitializeTBCMounts()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the list of mounts available in The Burning Crusade expansion
    for the MountManager.
  description: The InitializeTBCMounts method sets up and loads all mount entries
    specific to the The Burning Crusade (TBC) expansion into the MountManager's internal
    data structures. This method is typically called during server initialization
    or when a player logs in to ensure that TBC-specific mounts are properly registered
    and available for use. It configures mount properties such as display IDs, speed
    values, and availability conditions based on the TBC game data. The method ensures
    that players can access and summon their TBC mounts according to expansion requirements
    and account restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager mountMgr;

      mountMgr.InitializeTBCMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when initializing
    mount data for a new player. It modifies internal state and is not thread-safe
    if multiple threads attempt to initialize mounts simultaneously.
  warnings: Do not call this method after mounts have already been initialized, as
    it may cause duplicate entries or inconsistent mount states. Ensure that all TBC
    mount data is properly loaded before invoking this function.
