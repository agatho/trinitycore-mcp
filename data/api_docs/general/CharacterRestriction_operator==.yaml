documentation:
  brief: Compares two CharacterRestriction objects for equality based on their internal
    data members.
  description: The operator== method performs a member-wise comparison between this
    CharacterRestriction object and another CharacterRestriction object passed as
    a parameter. It returns true if all corresponding data members of both objects
    are equal, and false otherwise. This comparison is typically used to determine
    whether two character restrictions (such as level limits, race restrictions, or
    class restrictions) are identical in their configuration. The method is const,
    meaning it does not modify either object during the comparison operation. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this functionality supports
    checking if two restriction rules apply the same limitations to player characters.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: A constant reference to another CharacterRestriction object that
      is being compared against this object.
  returns: Returns true if all data members of the two CharacterRestriction objects
    are equal; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equality Check
    code: 'CharacterRestriction restrict1;

      CharacterRestriction restrict2;

      // Assume both objects have been initialized with same values

      bool isEqual = (restrict1 == restrict2); // Returns true if restrictions are
      identical'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Restriction Rules in Game Logic
    code: 'CharacterRestriction levelRestrict;

      levelRestrict.SetMinLevel(10);

      levelRestrict.SetMaxLevel(60);


      CharacterRestriction anotherRestrict = levelRestrict; // Copy constructor

      bool match = (levelRestrict == anotherRestrict); // Should return true'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using a simple field-by-field comparison.
    Since it's a comparison operator, performance should be efficient as it only involves
    basic data member checks. The method assumes that the internal data members of
    CharacterRestriction are comparable using their own equality operators.
