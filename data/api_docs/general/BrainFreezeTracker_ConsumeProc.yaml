  method: ConsumeProc
  signature: void BrainFreezeTracker::ConsumeProc()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a Brain Freeze proc, reducing the active proc counter and potentially
    triggering cooldown reset.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for handling the consumption
    of a Brain Freeze proc in the context of spell mechanics within TrinityCore. This
    method typically decreases an internal counter tracking active procs, and may
    trigger additional effects such as resetting cooldowns or applying debuffs. It
    is generally called when a proc condition is met and the proc needs to be consumed,
    ensuring proper state management for the Brain Freeze mechanic. The method does
    not accept parameters and performs no direct return operations, but modifies internal
    class state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void SpellEffectBrainFreeze(SpellEffIndex effIndex)\n{\n    if (m_caster->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n    {\n        Player* player = static_cast<Player*>(m_caster);\n\
      \        if (player->GetSpellModFlatValue(SPELLMOD_CHANCE_OF_SUCCESS) > 0)\n\
      \        {\n            player->GetBrainFreezeTracker()->ConsumeProc();\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger Brain Freeze tracking system and should only
    be called when a proc condition has been validated. The internal state of the
    tracker must be properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling ConsumeProc without verifying that a proc is active may lead to
    incorrect state management or unexpected cooldown behavior. Ensure that all preconditions
    for proc consumption are met prior to invocation.
