  class: Player
  method: GetLootSpecId
  signature: uint32 Player::GetLootSpecId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot specialization ID assigned to the player for determining
    loot distribution rules.
  description: This method retrieves the current loot specialization ID assigned to
    a player, which determines how loot is distributed among group members. The loot
    spec ID is used by the game engine to identify which specific loot rules apply
    to the player during loot collection. It is typically set when a player selects
    a loot spec in their character interface or when they join a raid group with a
    specific loot spec. This value affects how loot is handled during group loot scenarios,
    including whether the player receives loot based on their assigned spec or if
    they are eligible for loot based on other factors like item level or class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the unique loot specialization ID (uint32) that identifies the
    current loot rules applied to this player. A value of 0 indicates no specific
    loot spec is assigned, and the player may receive loot based on general group
    rules. Values greater than 0 represent a valid loot spec ID, typically corresponding
    to a specific class or role.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 lootSpecId = player->GetLootSpecId();\nif (lootSpecId > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player has a valid loot spec assigned\n    // Proceed with loot distribution\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the player's internal state management and should not
    be called directly in most cases. The loot spec ID is typically set via game mechanics
    when a player selects their specialization or joins a raid group. This method
    does not perform any validation or checks on the returned value, so it may return
    0 if no spec has been assigned.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine whether a player is eligible
    for loot; instead, use appropriate methods like GetLootMethod() or GetLootThreshold().
    Also, be cautious when using this in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    as it may affect how loot is distributed during group loot scenarios.
