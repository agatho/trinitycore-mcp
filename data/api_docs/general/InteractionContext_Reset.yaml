  class: InteractionContext
  method: Reset
  signature: void InteractionContext::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the interaction context to its initial state, clearing any active
    interactions or data.
  description: The Reset method clears all current interaction data within the InteractionContext
    object, effectively returning it to its default state. This method is typically
    invoked when an interaction session needs to be terminated or restarted, ensuring
    that no stale data persists between different interaction cycles. It may reset
    internal counters, clear cached values, and invalidate any active interaction
    handles. The behavior of this method is crucial for maintaining clean state management
    in interactive systems such as quest interactions, NPC dialogues, or object-based
    interactions within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'InteractionContext context;

      // ... perform some interactions ...

      context.Reset(); // Clear all interaction data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset After Interaction Completion
    code: "void HandlePlayerInteraction(Player* player, GameObject* go) {\n    InteractionContext\
      \ context;\n    // Process interaction logic\n    context.ProcessInteraction(player,\
      \ go);\n    // Reset context after completion\n    context.Reset();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before reusing an InteractionContext object
    to prevent data leakage between different interaction sessions. It's recommended
    to call Reset() after each complete interaction cycle to maintain system integrity.
  warnings: Calling Reset() on an active interaction may result in loss of important
    state information if not properly coordinated with the interaction lifecycle management.
    Ensure that all dependent systems are notified of the reset before invoking this
    method.
