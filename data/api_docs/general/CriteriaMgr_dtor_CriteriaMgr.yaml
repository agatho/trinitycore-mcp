documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CriteriaMgr instance and cleans up all associated criteria data.
  description: The destructor for the CriteriaMgr class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all resources associated with the criteria management system. This
    includes releasing memory allocated for criteria entries, clearing internal data
    structures, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The destructor is automatically
    invoked when a CriteriaMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures
    that all criterion-related data such as achievement progress, quest requirements,
    and other conditional triggers are properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks
    and maintain system stability.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CriteriaMgr
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CriteriaMgr* criteriaMgr = new CriteriaMgr();\n\
      \    // ... use criteriaMgr ...\n    delete criteriaMgr; // Destructor automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern in C++. It ensures that all criterion-related resources are properly released
    when the manager is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless explicitly managing object lifecycle through raw pointers.
