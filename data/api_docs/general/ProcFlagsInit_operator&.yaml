documentation:
  brief: Performs a bitwise AND operation between the current ProcFlags2 value and
    another ProcFlags2 value
  description: The operator& method implements a bitwise AND operation on the ProcFlags2
    enumeration values. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to
    combine or filter proc flags, which define conditions under which abilities or
    effects can trigger. The method takes another ProcFlags2 value and returns a new
    ProcFlags2 that represents the intersection of flags between the two values. This
    operation is essential for determining whether specific proc conditions are met
    when processing combat events or spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ProcFlags2 value representing the result of the bitwise AND operation
    between the current object's flags and the provided ProcFlags2 value. The returned
    value will only contain flags that are present in both operands.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bitwise AND Operation
    code: 'ProcFlags2 flags1 = PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_MELEE_HIT | PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_RANGED_HIT;

      ProcFlags2 flags2 = PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_MELEE_HIT | PROC_FLAG_ON_CAST;

      ProcFlags2 result = flags1 & flags2;

      // result will contain only PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_MELEE_HIT'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Specific Proc Conditions
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nProcFlags2 procFlags = target->GetProcFlags();\nif\
      \ (procFlags & PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_MELEE_HIT) {\n    // Handle melee hit proc\
      \ logic\n}\nif (procFlags & (PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_MELEE_HIT | PROC_FLAG_SUCCESSFUL_RANGED_HIT))\
      \ {\n    // Handle both melee and ranged hit procs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used in combat system logic to determine if specific
    proc conditions are satisfied. The ProcFlags2 type is a bitmask enumeration, so
    the bitwise AND operation effectively filters which flags are common between two
    sets of proc conditions. This method does not modify the original object but returns
    a new value.
  warnings: Be aware that bitwise operations on proc flags can lead to unexpected
    results if not all possible flag combinations are considered. Always validate
    that the resulting flags make sense in the context of your spell or ability logic.
