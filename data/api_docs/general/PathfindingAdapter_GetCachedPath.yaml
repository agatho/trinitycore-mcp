  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: GetCachedPath
  signature: bool PathfindingAdapter::GetCachedPath(Player * bot, const int & destination,
    MovementPath & path) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a cached movement path for a bot to a specified destination.
  description: The GetCachedPath method attempts to retrieve a pre-calculated movement
    path from the pathfinding system for a given player bot and destination. It checks
    if a valid cached path exists for the specified destination and, if found, copies
    the path data into the provided MovementPath object. This method is typically
    used in AI-driven bots to optimize movement decisions by reusing previously computed
    paths instead of recalculating them each time. The method returns true if a valid
    cached path was found and successfully copied; otherwise, it returns false. This
    caching mechanism helps reduce CPU overhead during bot navigation and improves
    overall performance in scenarios with frequent path lookups.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the cached
      path is being retrieved. Must not be null.
  - name: destination
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination point for which the
      cached path is requested. This typically corresponds to a waypoint or target
      location ID.
  - name: path
    description: Reference to a MovementPath object where the retrieved cached path
      data will be copied. The object must be properly initialized before calling
      this method.
  returns: Boolean value indicating success or failure of retrieving the cached path.
    Returns true if a valid cached path was found and copied into the provided MovementPath
    object; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint destination = 12345;\nMovementPath cachedPath;\n\
      if (pathfindingAdapter->GetCachedPath(bot, destination, cachedPath)) {\n   \
      \ // Use the cached path for bot movement\n    bot->MoveTo(cachedPath);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where no cached path exists\n    // Recalculate or find\
      \ alternative path\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Logic
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool NavigateToDestination(Player* bot, int\
      \ destination) {\n        MovementPath path;\n        if (pathfindingAdapter->GetCachedPath(bot,\
      \ destination, path)) {\n            // Execute cached path\n            return\
      \ bot->ExecuteMovementPath(path);\n        } else {\n            // Fallback\
      \ to pathfinding calculation\n            return CalculateAndSetNewPath(bot,\
      \ destination);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal caching mechanism of the PathfindingAdapter.
    The cache may be invalidated due to map changes, dynamic obstacles, or other environmental
    factors. Developers should ensure that bots are capable of falling back to full
    pathfinding when cached paths are not available. Performance is optimized when
    multiple bots navigate to similar destinations, as shared cached paths can significantly
    reduce computational load.
  warnings: Do not assume that a cached path will always be valid or up-to-date. Always
    implement fallback logic for cases where the method returns false. The destination
    parameter must correspond to a valid and reachable point in the game world; otherwise,
    the method may fail even if a cache entry exists.
