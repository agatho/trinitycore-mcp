  class: GameObject
  method: GetLootMode
  signature: uint16 GameObject::GetLootMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot mode of the game object, determining how loot is distributed
    among players.
  description: The GetLootMode method retrieves the current loot mode setting for
    a GameObject, which controls how loot is distributed among players when the object
    is looted. This value influences the behavior of loot distribution mechanics,
    including whether loot is distributed as a group or individual, and determines
    the specific rules that apply to loot generation. The method is typically used
    in conjunction with other loot-related methods to manage game object loot behavior
    and ensure proper loot distribution according to specified conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the current loot mode of the GameObject.
    This value corresponds to different loot modes such as 1 (group loot), 2 (individual
    loot), or other values depending on the game mechanics configuration and context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 lootMode = gameObject->GetLootMode();\nif (lootMode == 1)\n{\n \
      \   // Group loot mode\n}\nelse if (lootMode == 2)\n{\n    // Individual loot\
      \ mode\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject's loot management system and should
    be used in conjunction with other loot-related methods to fully understand the
    current loot distribution behavior. The value returned by this method may vary
    depending on the game object's configuration and the current game mechanics settings.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may affect how loot
    is distributed among players, potentially leading to incorrect loot behavior if
    not properly handled in relation to other loot-related methods.
