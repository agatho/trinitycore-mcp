  class: Spell
  method: CallScriptCalcCritChanceHandlers
  signature: void Spell::CallScriptCalcCritChanceHandlers(const Unit * victim, float
    & chance)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the critical hit chance for a spell based on script handlers
  description: This method invokes all registered script handlers that modify the
    critical hit chance calculation for spells. It takes a victim unit and modifies
    the chance value based on various factors including buffs, debuffs, and other
    game mechanics. The method is typically called during spell processing to determine
    if a spell will critically hit, affecting damage output and other spell effects.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: The unit that is being attacked by the spell. This parameter determines
      the target for which the critical chance is calculated.
  - name: chance
    description: Reference to a float value that will be modified by script handlers.
      The value represents the base critical hit chance before any modifications are
      applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::CallScriptCalcCritChanceHandlers(const Unit * victim, float\
      \ & chance)\n{\n    // Example implementation\n    chance = 0.0f;\n    // Apply\
      \ various modifiers based on script handlers\n    // This method is typically\
      \ called during spell processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the spell is being processed and the
    victim is known. The method may be invoked multiple times during a single spell
    execution depending on game mechanics and script handlers.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying the chance value, as it affects all
    subsequent calculations for critical hit chance in the spell processing chain.
    Incorrect handling can lead to inaccurate damage calculations.
