  brief: Calculates and returns the value of a quest item based on the quest's requirements
    and player data.
  description: The CalculateItemValue method computes a float value representing the
    worth or utility of an item within the context of a specific quest. This calculation
    typically considers factors such as the item's quality, level, and how it contributes
    to quest completion. The method is used internally by the QuestManager to determine
    item relevance and potential rewards. It does not modify any state and relies
    on the provided quest object for its calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated item worth or utility within
    the context of the given quest. The exact meaning may vary based on implementation,
    but typically reflects how much the item contributes to quest progression or reward
    value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage

  notes: This method is likely used in quest reward calculations or item evaluation
    systems. It may be called during quest status checks or when determining if an
    item meets quest requirements.
