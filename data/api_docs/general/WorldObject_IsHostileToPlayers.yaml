documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the WorldObject is considered hostile to players in the
    game world.
  description: The IsHostileToPlayers method checks if the current WorldObject has
    a hostile relationship with player characters. This determination typically involves
    evaluating the object's faction, reaction level, and any scripted or dynamic hostility
    flags. The method returns true if the object is hostile to at least one player
    in the vicinity, and false otherwise. In World of Warcraft's context, this is
    commonly used for AI behavior decisions, combat triggers, and determining whether
    an NPC should engage in combat with players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the WorldObject is hostile to players.
    Returns true if the object is hostile to at least one player; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for NPC Hostility Check
    code: "if (creature->IsHostileToPlayers())\n{\n    // Trigger hostile behavior\
      \ or combat\n    creature->AI()->AttackStart(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Player-Object Interaction Logic
    code: "if (unit->IsHostileToPlayers() && unit->IsInWorld())\n{\n    // Ensure\
      \ the unit is active and hostile before taking action\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform faction-based lookups or cached reaction evaluations.
    It's commonly used in AI decision-making loops to determine if an object should
    initiate combat or avoid player interaction. The result can change dynamically
    based on faction changes, quest states, or scripted events.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths
    as it may involve faction lookups or cached state checks. Avoid calling this method
    excessively in tight loops without caching the result if the hostility status
    is expected to remain stable during a single game tick.
