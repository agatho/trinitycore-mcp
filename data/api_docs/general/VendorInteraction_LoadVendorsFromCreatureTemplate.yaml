documentation:
  brief: Loads vendor data from creature templates into the vendor interaction system
  description: This method initializes and populates vendor information by extracting
    item data from creature templates. It processes the creature template's vendor
    data to build internal vendor item lists that are used when players interact with
    vendor NPCs. The method ensures that all items available for sale through creature
    templates are properly loaded into memory for subsequent vendor interactions.
    This typically occurs during server startup or when loading creature data, and
    it prepares the vendor system to handle player purchase requests.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendorSystem;

      vendorSystem.LoadVendorsFromCreatureTemplate();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when creature
    templates are loaded. It may be invoked multiple times if new creature templates
    with vendor data are added dynamically. The method assumes that creature templates
    have already been loaded and contain valid vendor item data.
