    const int & requestedActivePlayerMask, const Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates a data buffer with update values for a player based on specified
    object, unit, player, and active player masks.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask method constructs an update
    packet containing specific player data fields based on the provided masks. It
    is used internally by the TrinityCore server to efficiently serialize player state
    information for transmission to clients. The method takes four mask parameters
    that determine which parts of the player's update data should be included in the
    output buffer. This allows for selective updates, reducing bandwidth usage and
    improving performance. The target player parameter specifies which player's data
    is being serialized, while the data buffer is populated with the relevant field
    values according to the mask specifications.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be filled with the update values.
      This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold all the requested
      fields.
  - name: requestedObjectMask
    description: Bitmask specifying which object-related fields should be included
      in the update data. Each bit corresponds to a specific object field in the update
      packet structure.
  - name: requestedUnitMask
    description: Bitmask specifying which unit-related fields should be included in
      the update data. This includes fields such as health, power, and other unit-specific
      attributes.
  - name: requestedPlayerMask
    description: Bitmask specifying which player-specific fields should be included
      in the update data. These typically include player statistics, inventory information,
      and character-specific properties.
  - name: requestedActivePlayerMask
    description: Bitmask specifying which active player-related fields should be included
      in the update data. This mask is used for fields that are only relevant when
      the player is actively engaged in gameplay.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose data will be serialized into the
      data buffer. If null, the method may use the current player instance or throw
      an error depending on implementation details.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example for building player update data
    code: 'int updateData[100];

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // some player instance

      Player::BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(updateData, 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08,
      targetPlayer);

      // updateData now contains selected player fields based on the provided masks'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom mask combinations
    code: 'int buffer[50];

      uint32 objectMask = 0x0001 | 0x0002; // Include object fields 0 and 1

      uint32 unitMask = 0x0004 | 0x0008; // Include unit fields 2 and 3

      uint32 playerMask = 0x0010 | 0x0020; // Include player fields 4 and 5

      uint32 activeMask = 0x0040 | 0x0080; // Include active player fields 6 and 7

      Player::BuildValuesUpdateForPlayerWithMask(buffer, objectMask, unitMask, playerMask,
      activeMask, target);

      // Buffer now contains a custom combination of update fields'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the server's update system. The
    data buffer size should be carefully managed to avoid overflow. The masks are
    usually defined as bitmasks that correspond to specific field indices in the player's
    update packet structure. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary
    calls when no updates are needed, and ensuring proper memory alignment for the
    target buffer.
  warnings: The method assumes that the data buffer has sufficient space allocated
    to hold all requested fields. Passing an insufficiently sized buffer can lead
    to memory corruption. The target parameter must not be null unless the implementation
    handles null cases gracefully. Incorrect mask values may result in incomplete
    or malformed update packets.
