  method: Summon
  signature: void SummonList::Summon(const int * summon)
documentation:
  brief: Summons a creature or object using the provided summon identifier.
  description: The SummonList::Summon method is used to activate and spawn a summoned
    creature or object within the game world. This method typically operates on a
    list of summons managed by an AI or control system, allowing for dynamic spawning
    of creatures or objects based on predefined identifiers. It is commonly used in
    AI scripts where summoned units need to be brought into existence at specific
    points during gameplay. The method requires a valid summon identifier to determine
    which creature or object to summon from the internal summon list.
  parameters:
  - name: summon
    description: A pointer to an integer identifier that specifies which summon in
      the SummonList should be activated. This integer typically corresponds to a
      predefined index or type ID used internally by the game engine to determine
      what creature or object to spawn.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Summon Usage
    code: 'SummonList summonList;

      int summonId = 5;

      summonList.Summon(&summonId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Summon with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_SUMMON_DEMON))\n{\n    int summonType = 3;\n\
      \    summonList.Summon(&summonType);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the SummonList has already been initialized with
    valid summon data. The integer pointed to by 'summon' must be within the valid
    range of indices for the summon list, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
    This method is typically called from AI update routines or event handlers.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or out-of-bounds pointer to 'summon' can lead to crashes
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the summon identifier corresponds to a valid
    entry in the SummonList before calling this method.
