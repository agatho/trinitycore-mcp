  class: TargetManager
  method: IsHighPriorityTarget
  signature: bool TargetManager::IsHighPriorityTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified unit is considered a high-priority target
    for AI behavior.
  description: The IsHighPriorityTarget method evaluates whether a given Unit object
    meets criteria to be classified as a high-priority target within the context of
    AI decision-making. This typically involves checking if the target poses a significant
    threat or has strategic importance, such as being a player character with high
    combat potential, a boss mob, or an important quest NPC. The method is used by
    AI systems to prioritize targeting behavior and resource allocation during combat
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being evaluated for high-priority
      status. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit meets the criteria for being a high-priority
    target, false otherwise. The evaluation may consider factors such as unit type,
    health status, threat level, faction, and role in current gameplay context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (targetManager->IsHighPriorityTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ high-priority attack or special ability\n    ai->SetCurrentTarget(targetUnit);\n\
      \    ai->CastSpellOnTarget(spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Target Selection Logic
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfloat highestPriority = 0.0f;\nfor (auto&\
      \ target : possibleTargets) {\n    if (targetManager->IsHighPriorityTarget(target))\
      \ {\n        float priority = CalculateTargetPriority(target);\n        if (priority\
      \ > highestPriority) {\n            highestPriority = priority;\n          \
      \  bestTarget = target;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI priority tables or configuration settings
    to determine target importance. It may cache results for performance reasons in
    frequently called contexts. The exact criteria for high-priority targets can vary
    based on the specific AI behavior module and current game state.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The method's logic may
    change based on game updates or AI configuration modifications.
