  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other battle pet related
    functions and may require proper initialization of battle pet data before execution.

    associated with it, otherwise it may cause undefined behavior or errors. Ensure
    that the level parameter is within acceptable game limits to avoid potential issues.
