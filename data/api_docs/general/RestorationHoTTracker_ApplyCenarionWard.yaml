  method: ApplyCenarionWard
  signature: void RestorationHoTTracker::ApplyCenarionWard(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Cenarion Ward buff to a target player with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyCenarionWard method is used to activate the Cenarion Ward
    spell effect on a targeted player character. This spell provides a protective
    barrier that absorbs damage and grants healing over time. The method takes a unique
    identifier (GUID) for the target player and a duration in seconds, which determines
    how long the buff will remain active. It is typically invoked by restoration druids
    as part of their defensive gameplay mechanics. The implementation likely involves
    updating the target's aura state and applying relevant periodic healing effects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player to apply the Cenarion
      Ward buff to. This value must correspond to a valid player object in the game
      world.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in seconds for which the Cenarion Ward buff will remain
      active. Valid values are typically within the range of 1-300 seconds, depending
      on spell level and caster's buffs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RestorationHoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyCenarionWard(123456, 120);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying to Multiple Targets
    code: "std::vector<int> targetGuids = {123456, 123457, 123458};\nfor (int guid\
      \ : targetGuids) {\n    tracker.ApplyCenarionWard(guid, 180);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the World of Warcraft's aura system and
    may require synchronization with server-side state updates. The actual implementation
    details depend on how the spell is registered in the spell system and whether
    it uses existing HoT (Heal over Time) mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid player object before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior or crashes may occur. Also, verify that
    the duration value is within acceptable bounds for the spell's intended functionality.
