documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player with the specified GUID is a member of the guild
  description: The IsMember method determines if a player identified by their global
    unique identifier (GUID) is currently a member of the guild. This method performs
    a lookup within the guild's internal member list to verify membership status.
    It is commonly used in game logic to validate player permissions, restrict access
    to guild features, or perform actions that require guild membership verification.
    The method does not perform any database queries directly but relies on cached
    or in-memory data structures representing the guild's current members.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a player with the specified GUID is found in the guild's
    member list; otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the given player
    is currently a member of this guild.
  examples:
  - title: Basic membership check
    code: "if (guild->IsMember(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is a guild member, proceed\
      \ with guild-specific actions\n    SendGuildMessage(\"Welcome back, member!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Player is not in the guild\n    SendErrorMessage(\"You\
      \ must be a guild member to perform this action.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a command handler
    code: "void HandleGuildCheckCommand(ChatHandler* handler, char const* args) {\n\
      \    uint32 guid = atol(args);\n    if (guild->IsMember(guid)) {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Player with GUID %u is a guild member.\", guid);\n    } else {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Player with GUID %u is not in the guild.\", guid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the guild's internal data structures and assumes
    that member lists are properly maintained. It may not reflect real-time changes
    if the guild state has not been updated recently. The GUID parameter should be
    a valid player identifier obtained from player objects or database queries.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections as
    it involves searching through the guild's member list. If frequent checks are
    needed, consider caching results or optimizing the underlying data structure for
    membership lookups.
