  method: SetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex
  signature: void PetStable::SetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex(uint32 index)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the index of the currently unslotted pet in the pet stable.
  description: The SetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex method updates the internal tracking
    index for the currently unslotted pet within the pet stable system. This method
    is typically used to manage which pet slot is considered active or ready for interaction
    when no pet is currently slotted. The index parameter represents the zero-based
    position of the pet in the stable's pet array. This functionality supports the
    game mechanics where players can switch between different unslotted pets without
    having a pet actively summoned. The method does not perform any validation on
    the provided index value, so it's expected that callers ensure the index is within
    valid bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The zero-based index of the pet in the stable's pet array to set
      as the current unslotted pet. This should typically be a value between 0 and
      the maximum number of pet slots minus one, though no validation is performed
      internally.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Current Unslotted Pet Index
    code: 'PetStable* stable = player->GetPetStable();

      stable->SetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex(2); // Sets the third pet in the stable
      as current unslotted'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal pet management system and may be called
    automatically by the game engine during certain operations like pet switching
    or loading. Developers should ensure that the index passed to this method corresponds
    to a valid pet slot in the stable's array to avoid unexpected behavior.
