documentation:
  brief: Retrieves coordination metrics for a specified group's loot distribution
    process
  description: The GetGroupCoordinationMetrics method fetches detailed statistics
    and performance data related to how loot is coordinated within a specific group.
    This includes information about loot roll outcomes, player participation, timing
    metrics, and distribution efficiency. The method is typically used by the loot
    coordination system to monitor and analyze group-based loot management behavior
    in World of Warcraft instances. It provides insights into how effectively loot
    is being distributed among group members and can be used for debugging or performance
    optimization purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootCoordinationMetrics object containing detailed statistics about the
    group's loot coordination, including roll counts, distribution times, participant
    data, and efficiency metrics. Returns an empty or default-initialized structure
    if no coordination data exists for the specified group.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Metrics for Group
    code: "LootCoordinationMetrics metrics = lootCoordination->GetGroupCoordinationMetrics(12345);\n\
      if (!metrics.IsEmpty())\n{\n    // Process and display metrics\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Total rolls: \" << metrics.TotalRolls << std::endl;\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Average time: \" << metrics.AverageTimeMs << \" ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's loot coordination system and assumes
    that the group has previously engaged in loot distribution events. The returned
    metrics may be cached or updated asynchronously, so results might not reflect
    real-time changes immediately. Performance impact is minimal as it typically involves
    simple data retrieval from internal tracking structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or inactive group ID may return
    default/empty metrics without error. Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an
    actual active group before processing returned data to avoid incorrect analysis.
