documentation:
  brief: Initializes all triggers associated with this AI strategy.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all trigger objects
    that are part of the AI strategy. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of an AI behavior system to ensure that all conditional events and actions
    are properly registered and ready for execution. It establishes the foundation
    for how the AI will respond to various in-game situations based on defined conditions.

  - title: Basic Strategy Initialization
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = new CombatStrategy();

      myStrategy->InitializeTriggers();

      // Strategy is now ready to handle combat-related triggers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the strategy's lifecycle, typically
    after all necessary configuration has been completed. It's important that trigger
    dependencies are properly set up before calling this method.
