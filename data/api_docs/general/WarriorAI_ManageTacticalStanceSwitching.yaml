documentation:
  brief: Manages switching between tactical stances for warrior AI behavior.
  description: The ManageTacticalStanceSwitching method controls the logic for switching
    between different tactical stances (such as Battle Stance, Defensive Stance, and
    Berserker Stance) based on combat conditions and AI decision-making. This method
    evaluates the current threat level, target proximity, and available abilities
    to determine the most appropriate stance for optimal performance in battle. It
    is typically called during the AI update cycle to ensure the warrior maintains
    the correct stance for its current tactical situation.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ManageTacticalStanceSwitching();\n\n    // Other AI\
      \ logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core warrior AI behavior system and should be
    called regularly during the AI update cycle. The stance switching decisions are
    based on internal AI state and combat conditions, not external input.
