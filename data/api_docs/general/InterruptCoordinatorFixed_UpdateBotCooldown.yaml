  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: UpdateBotCooldown
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::UpdateBotCooldown(int botGuid, uint32
    cooldownMs)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timer for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The UpdateBotCooldown method is responsible for modifying or setting
    the cooldown duration for a particular bot within the InterruptCoordinatorFixed
    system. This method ensures that bots do not perform actions too frequently, adhering
    to game mechanics that prevent spamming or overuse of abilities. It takes a bot's
    unique identifier (GUID) and a cooldown time in milliseconds as inputs to update
    the internal tracking of when that bot can next perform an action. The method
    is typically used during AI processing or combat logic to enforce timing constraints
    on bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose cooldown is being updated.
      This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the system.
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The cooldown duration in milliseconds to be applied to the specified
      bot. A value of 0 may indicate immediate availability, while higher values delay
      the bot's next possible action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateBotCooldown(12345, 5000); // Sets cooldown for bot with GUID
      12345 to 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Cooldown to Immediate Availability
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.UpdateBotCooldown(67890, 0); // Resets cooldown for bot with GUID
      67890 to allow immediate action'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that track cooldowns
    per bot. It may be called from AI update loops or combat handlers, and should
    be used carefully to avoid disrupting expected behavior patterns in bot actions.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the cooldown value could lead to bots acting too frequently
    or being locked out of actions indefinitely. Ensure that botGuid corresponds to
    an existing bot entity to prevent undefined behavior.
