  class: PriestAI
  method: PriestAI
  signature: void PriestAI::PriestAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Priest AI behavior for a bot with specified settings.
  description: The PriestAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence behavior
    for a priest-class bot in TrinityCore. This method sets up the bot's decision-making
    process, including spell selection, target prioritization, and combat strategies
    specific to the priest class. It configures the AI to handle various game mechanics
    such as mana management, healing priorities, and damage-dealing abilities based
    on the current combat situation. The initialization process ensures that the bot
    will follow appropriate priest-specific tactics when engaged in player-versus-player
    or player-versus-environment encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's unique identifier or
      configuration settings. This parameter is used to initialize the AI with specific
      bot properties and behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Priest AI Initialization
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      PriestAI priestAI(&botId);

      // The AI is now initialized for bot with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Priest Bots
    code: "int botIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n   \
      \ PriestAI priestAI(&botIds[i]);\n    // Each bot is initialized with its respective\
      \ ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The parameter
    'bot' must point to a valid integer identifier; otherwise, undefined behavior
    may occur. The AI initialization process includes setting up internal state machines
    and spell selection algorithms specific to priest class mechanics.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'bot' represents
    a valid bot configuration before calling this constructor.
