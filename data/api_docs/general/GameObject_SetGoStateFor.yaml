  class: GameObject
  method: SetGoStateFor
  signature: void GameObject::SetGoStateFor(int state, const int * viewer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the game object state for a specific viewer.
  description: This method allows setting the state of a game object for a particular
    viewer, which controls how the object appears to that specific player. The state
    determines whether the object is visible or hidden, and can be used to control
    visibility based on player's faction, quest status, or other conditions. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with other game object methods to manage
    dynamic object states during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The state value to set for the game object. Valid values are typically
      0-7, where 0 represents 'hidden' and values 1-7 represent various 'visible'
      states depending on the context.
  - name: viewer
    description: Pointer to the viewer (player) for which the state is being set.
      If null, the state is applied to all players viewing the object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetGoStateFor(1, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetGoStateFor(3, &player->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with SetGoState() and related
    methods to manage game object visibility. It's important to note that the state
    values should be carefully chosen based on the intended behavior of the object,
    as incorrect states can lead to visual inconsistencies or gameplay issues.
  warnings: The viewer parameter must be properly initialized and valid; otherwise,
    the method may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Also, setting state for a
    specific viewer should only be done when necessary, as it may impact performance
    if used excessively.
