  class: BotProfiler
  method: StopProfilingSession
  signature: bool BotProfiler::StopProfilingSession(uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Stops a profiling session identified by the given session ID and returns
    whether the operation was successful.
  description: The StopProfilingSession method terminates an active profiling session
    within the BotProfiler system. It takes a unique session identifier (sessionId)
    as input and attempts to halt the associated profiling activity. This method is
    typically used in conjunction with StartProfilingSession to manage profiling cycles
    for bot behavior analysis or performance monitoring. The method ensures that any
    resources allocated for profiling are properly released and that the session state
    is correctly updated. It's important to note that attempting to stop a non-existent
    or already-stopped session may result in a failure return value.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier representing the profiling session to be stopped.
      This value should correspond to a valid session previously created by StartProfilingSession.
      The session ID is of type uint64_t and must be a positive integer.
  returns: Returns true if the profiling session was successfully stopped, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that no active session with the specified
    sessionId exists, or an internal error occurred during the stopping process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = botProfiler.StartProfilingSession();\n// ... perform\
      \ some profiling operations ...\nbool success = botProfiler.StopProfilingSession(sessionId);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Profiling session stopped successfully\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Failed to stop the session\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 123456789ULL;\nbool result = botProfiler.StopProfilingSession(sessionId);\n\
      if (!result) {\n    // Log error or handle case where session could not be stopped\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to stop profiling session %llu\", sessionId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in the TrinityCore environment and assumes
    that profiling sessions are managed internally by the BotProfiler class. It's
    recommended to ensure that all profiling activities are properly synchronized
    when used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID may lead
    to undefined behavior or failure. Always verify that a session exists before attempting
    to stop it, especially if session IDs are dynamically generated or passed from
    external sources.
