documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the player's toy collection data from the database.
  description: The LoadToys method is responsible for retrieving all toy entries associated
    with a player from the database and populating the internal toy collection data
    structures. This method is typically invoked during player login or when the toy
    collection needs to be refreshed in memory. It ensures that the player's known
    toys are properly tracked and available for use within the game mechanics, such
    as toy usage, display in the toy box interface, and related achievements. The
    method performs database queries to fetch toy records and updates the CollectionMgr's
    internal state accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // ... other login logic ...\n    sCollectionMgr->LoadToys();\n\
      \    // ... rest of login logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the CollectionMgr system and
    should not typically be invoked directly by other subsystems. It may perform database
    I/O operations which could impact performance during player login if a large number
    of toys are present.
  warnings: Invoking this method manually outside of the normal login flow may result
    in inconsistent toy state or duplicate entries if not properly synchronized with
    the database. Ensure that the player session is fully initialized before calling
    this method.
