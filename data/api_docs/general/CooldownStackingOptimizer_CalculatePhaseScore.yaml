  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: CalculatePhaseScore
  signature: float CooldownStackingOptimizer::CalculatePhaseScore(BossPhase phase)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a phase score based on cooldown stacking optimization
    for boss encounters.
  description: The CalculatePhaseScore method evaluates the effectiveness of cooldown
    usage during a specific boss phase within a TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft
    server. This method is typically used in AI-driven encounter scripts to determine
    optimal timing for abilities or mechanics based on cooldown availability and encounter
    progression. It considers factors such as ability priority, cooldown duration,
    and phase-specific requirements to compute a numerical score that reflects the
    efficiency of the current phase's cooldown management strategy. The returned value
    can be used by the AI system to make decisions about when to activate certain
    abilities or transitions between phases.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated phase score, where higher values
    indicate better cooldown stacking optimization and strategic timing for the current
    boss phase. Values typically range from 0.0 (inefficient) to 1.0 (optimal), though
    actual ranges may vary based on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Boss AI Logic
    code: "class MyBossAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (cooldownOptimizer)\n        {\n       \
      \     float score = cooldownOptimizer->CalculatePhaseScore(BossPhase::Phase1);\n\
      \            if (score > 0.8f)\n                DoSomethingOptimal();\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger cooldown management system and may
    depend on internal state tracking of abilities, cooldowns, and encounter phases.
    The exact scoring algorithm is implementation-specific but generally involves
    evaluating the current cooldown state against expected optimal usage patterns.
  warnings: The returned score should not be used in isolation for decision making
    without considering other factors such as health percentages, target positioning,
    or encounter phase transitions. This method may return unexpected values if called
    outside of a proper boss encounter context.
