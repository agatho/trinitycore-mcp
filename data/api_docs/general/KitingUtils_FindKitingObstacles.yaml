  class: KitingUtils
  method: FindKitingObstacles
  signature: int KitingUtils::FindKitingObstacles(const int & center, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and counts kiting obstacles within a specified radius from a given
    center point.
  description: The FindKitingObstacles method calculates the number of environmental
    or object-based obstacles that would impede a unit's ability to kite (move while
    attacking) in a circular area around a defined center point. This method is typically
    used by AI systems to evaluate movement feasibility and pathfinding options during
    combat. It considers factors such as terrain, object placement, and collision
    boundaries within the specified radius. The method returns an integer representing
    the count of obstacles detected, which can be used for decision-making in kiting
    behavior logic.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point from which to search for obstacles. This is typically
      a coordinate or position identifier within the game world.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area around the center point to scan for
      obstacles. Must be a positive float value representing distance units in the
      game world.
  returns: An integer representing the total number of kiting obstacles found within
    the specified radius from the center point. A return value of zero indicates no
    obstacles were detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to detect kiting obstacles
    code: int obstacleCount = KitingUtils::FindKitingObstacles(player->GetMapId(),
      10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to determine kiting strategy
    code: "int obstacles = KitingUtils::FindKitingObstacles(enemy->GetPositionX(),\
      \ 5.0f);\nif (obstacles > 3) {\n    // Avoid kiting, choose different movement\
      \ pattern\n    ai->SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_CHARGE);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with kiting behavior\n    ai->SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_KITE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial queries against the game world's collision
    system to determine obstacle locations. It may cache results or use optimized
    spatial partitioning for performance in high-frequency calls. The center parameter
    should be a valid map identifier or position reference, and the radius must be
    non-negative.
  warnings: Ensure that the center point is valid and within the current map bounds
    to avoid undefined behavior. Large radius values may impact performance due to
    increased computational load from scanning more area. This method assumes the
    underlying collision system is properly initialized.
