  class: Action
  method: DoEmote
  signature: bool Action::DoEmote(BotAI * ai, uint32 emoteId)
documentation:
  brief: Performs an emote action using the specified emote ID within the bot's AI
    context.
  description: The DoEmote method executes a predefined emote animation for a bot
    character within the TrinityCore WoW emulator environment. This method is typically
    used in AI scripts to make bots perform visual actions such as greeting, laughing,
    or expressing emotions. The emote is executed immediately and returns a boolean
    indicating success or failure of the operation. It requires a valid BotAI context
    and a valid emote ID from the game's emote database.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot performing the
      emote. Must be a valid, initialized AI object.
  - name: emoteId
    description: Unique identifier of the emote to be performed. Must correspond to
      a valid emote entry in the game's database (typically found in the Emotes.dbc
      file).
  returns: Returns true if the emote was successfully initiated and queued for execution,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid emote ID, missing AI context,
    or if the bot is in an invalid state for performing emotes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emote Usage
    code: "if (action->DoEmote(ai, 1)) {\n    // Emote successfully queued\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      AI\", \"Bot performed emote 1\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to queue emote\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"AI\", \"Failed to perform emote 1\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Emote Based on Bot State
    code: "if (ai->GetBot()->GetHealthPct() < 20) {\n    if (action->DoEmote(ai, 31))\
      \ { // Emote: 'Cower'\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Bot cowered in fear\");\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    if (action->DoEmote(ai, 4)) { // Emote: 'Wave'\n     \
      \   LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Bot waved greeting\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The emote is not executed immediately but is queued for the next update cycle.
    The method does not block execution while waiting for animation completion. Emote
    IDs are typically sourced from the game's database and should be validated against
    existing entries to prevent runtime errors.
  warnings: Using an invalid emote ID may result in silent failure or undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the BotAI context is properly initialized before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will likely cause a crash. Emotes are not suitable for
    complex interactions and should be used sparingly to avoid spamming visual effects.
