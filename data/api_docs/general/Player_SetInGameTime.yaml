  class: Player
  method: SetInGameTime
  signature: void Player::SetInGameTime(uint32 time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the in-game time for the player to the specified timestamp.
  description: This method allows a player to set their in-game time to a specific
    value, which can be useful for various game mechanics including time manipulation,
    event triggering, or synchronization with server time. The method accepts a uint32
    parameter representing the time in seconds since the Unix epoch. It is typically
    used in conjunction with other time-related methods or when implementing custom
    game events. This action directly affects the player's current time state within
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The timestamp value in seconds since the Unix epoch that the player's
      in-game time will be set to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Player Time
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 time = 1609459200; // New Year''s Day 2021

      player->SetInGameTime(time);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in server-side code and may not be directly
    accessible to client-side players. It affects the player's time state within the
    game world, and should be used carefully when implementing custom events or time-based
    mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause synchronization issues with other
    players or game events, especially if the time value is set to a future date that
    may conflict with existing server events. Ensure proper validation before setting
    time values.
