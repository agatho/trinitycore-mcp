  brief: Returns the name of the battleground instance
  description: The GetName method retrieves the human-readable name of a battleground
    instance. This name is typically used for display purposes in the user interface,
    logging, or when communicating with players about specific battlegrounds. The
    returned string is managed by the battleground object and should not be modified
    or freed by the caller. This method is commonly used in battleground-related systems
    to identify which specific battleground is being referenced.
  parameters: []
  returns: A null-terminated C-style string containing the name of the battleground.
    The string is owned by the battleground instance and remains valid for the lifetime
    of the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Battleground Name
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Current battleground: %s\\n\", bg->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetName in Battleground Event Handling
    code: "void OnBattlegroundStart(Battleground* bg)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Battleground\
      \ %s has started.\", bg->GetName());\n    // Additional logic based on battleground\
      \ name\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is guaranteed to be valid and null-terminated as long
    as the Battleground object exists. This method is thread-safe for read operations,
    but modifications to the battleground instance should be synchronized if accessed
    from multiple threads.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned string pointer. The memory
    is managed internally by the Battleground class and will be invalidated when the
    battleground object is destroyed.
