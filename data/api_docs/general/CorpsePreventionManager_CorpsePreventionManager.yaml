  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CorpsePreventionManager class
  description: The CorpsePreventionManager constructor initializes the manager responsible
    for handling corpse prevention mechanics in the TrinityCore server. This class
    manages the logic that prevents players from leaving corpses under certain conditions,
    such as during PvP encounters or when specific game rules are active. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures and registers necessary event handlers
    to monitor player death and corpse creation events. It ensures that the corpse
    prevention system is properly configured before any gameplay interactions occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of CorpsePreventionManager
    code: CorpsePreventionManager* manager = new CorpsePreventionManager();
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or when the corpse
    prevention system needs to be initialized. The manager relies on various server
    configurations and game rules to determine when corpse prevention should be active.
