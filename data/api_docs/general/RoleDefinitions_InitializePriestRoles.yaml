documentation:
  brief: Initializes the role definitions for priest class specializations within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The InitializePriestRoles method sets up and configures the role assignments
    and behaviors specific to different priest specializations such as Discipline,
    Holy, and Shadow. This method is typically invoked during server initialization
    or when loading class-specific configurations. It ensures that each priest specialization
    has appropriate role definitions for AI decision-making, combat behavior, and
    spell selection logic within the game environment. The method does not require
    any input parameters and performs internal setup operations to prepare the role
    system for priest classes.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'RoleDefinitions roleDefs;

      roleDefs.InitializePriestRoles();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's initialization
    phase to avoid redundant operations. It is part of a larger system that manages
    class-specific roles in TrinityCore's AI framework and relies on internal configuration
    files for role data.
