documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat actions for the AI strategy
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and prepares all necessary combat
    behaviors and action sequences for a CombatStrategy instance. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an AI-controlled unit to configure its
    combat decision-making process. It establishes the foundation for how the AI will
    behave in combat situations, including action priorities, cooldown management,
    and target selection logic. The method ensures that all required actions are properly
    registered and ready for execution when combat begins.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Strategy Initialization
    code: 'CombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeActions();

      // Combat actions are now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's lifecycle, typically
    after all necessary configuration parameters have been set. The initialization
    process may involve creating action nodes, setting up behavior trees, or registering
    combat actions with the AI manager. It is important to note that this method does
    not start actual combat - it merely prepares the strategy for when combat begins.
