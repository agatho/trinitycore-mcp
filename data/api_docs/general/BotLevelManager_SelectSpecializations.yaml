  class: BotLevelManager
  method: SelectSpecializations
  signature: void BotLevelManager::SelectSpecializations(BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Selects appropriate specializations for bot characters based on their level
    and class.
  description: The SelectSpecializations method determines and assigns suitable talent
    specializations for bot characters during the creation process. This method evaluates
    the bot's current level, class, and other relevant factors to select an optimal
    specialization that aligns with the character's progression and role within the
    game. It ensures bots are created with appropriate abilities and playstyles consistent
    with their level and class distribution. The method is typically invoked as part
    of the BotCreationTask workflow when initializing new bot characters.
  parameters:
  - name: task
    description: Pointer to the BotCreationTask object containing information about
      the bot being created, including level, class, and other relevant parameters
      for specialization selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot creation workflow
    code: 'BotCreationTask* task = new BotCreationTask();

      task->SetLevel(60);

      task->SetClass(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      BotLevelManager levelManager;

      levelManager.SelectSpecializations(task);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot configuration tables and specialization
    data to determine valid combinations. It may cache results for performance optimization
    when creating multiple bots of similar levels or classes.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the BotCreationTask
    parameters may result in incorrect specialization assignments or undefined behavior.
    Ensure all required task properties are set before invocation.
