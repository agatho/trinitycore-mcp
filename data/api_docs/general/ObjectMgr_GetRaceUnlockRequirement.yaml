    race) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the race unlock requirement data for a specified race ID.
  description: The GetRaceUnlockRequirement method fetches the RaceUnlockRequirement
    structure associated with a given race identifier. This structure typically contains
    information about prerequisites or conditions required to unlock a specific race
    in the game, such as level requirements, quest completions, or other in-game achievements.
    The method returns a const pointer to the RaceUnlockRequirement object, ensuring
    that the data cannot be modified through this interface. It is commonly used during
    character creation or race selection to validate whether a player meets the necessary
    conditions to choose a particular race.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the RaceUnlockRequirement structure for the specified
    race. Returns nullptr if no unlock requirement data exists for the given race
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Check Unlock Requirement for Human Race
    code: "const RaceUnlockRequirement* req = sObjectMgr->GetRaceUnlockRequirement(RACE_HUMAN);\n\
      if (req != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process unlock requirement data\n    printf(\"\
      Human race requires level %u to unlock\\n\", req->RequiredLevel);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No unlock requirement found for Human race\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal game data tables that are loaded during server
    startup. Ensure the ObjectMgr instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the ObjectMgr instance
    remains active and the data has not been reloaded.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned RaceUnlockRequirement structure through the
    returned pointer, as it is marked const. Accessing invalid race IDs may return
    nullptr without error, so always check for null before using the result.
