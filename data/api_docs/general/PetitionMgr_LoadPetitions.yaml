  method: LoadPetitions
  signature: void PetitionMgr::LoadPetitions()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all player petition data from the database into memory for processing
    and validation.
  description: The LoadPetitions method initializes the petition system by retrieving
    all active and pending petitions from the database. It populates internal data
    structures with petition information including owner GUIDs, item entries, signatures,
    and status flags. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    the petition manager needs to refresh its cached data. The method ensures that
    all petition-related functionality operates correctly by having complete petition
    data available in memory before any petition operations are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializePetitionSystem()\n{\n    sPetitionMgr->LoadPetitions();\n\
      \    // Petitions are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries and should only be called during server
    initialization or when petition data needs to be refreshed. It's not thread-safe
    and should not be invoked concurrently with other petition operations. The method
    assumes that the database connection is already established.
  warnings: Calling this method while active petition processing is occurring may
    lead to inconsistent state. Avoid invoking it during high-traffic periods as it
    may block other operations while loading data from the database.
