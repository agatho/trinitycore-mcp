  brief: Award kills credit to player for defeating a specific target
  description: The KilledPlayerCredit method is used to grant kill credit to a player
    when they successfully defeat another player in PvP combat. This method is typically
    invoked when a player lands the final blow on an opponent, triggering the appropriate
    game mechanics to award the kill credit. The method accepts a victimGuid parameter
    which represents the unique identifier of the defeated player. It serves as part
    of the core gameplay system that tracks player-versus-player kills and contributes
    to various achievements and rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: victimGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the defeated player, used to determine
      which player kill credit should be awarded to the current player.
  returns: null

    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 victimGuid = 12345;

      player->KilledPlayerCredit(victimGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during PvP combat when a player lands the
    final blow on an opponent. It should be used in conjunction with other kill-related
    methods to properly track player kills and ensure proper game mechanics execution.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player actually defeats another
    player in PvP combat, otherwise it may lead to incorrect credit awarding or game
    balance issues.
