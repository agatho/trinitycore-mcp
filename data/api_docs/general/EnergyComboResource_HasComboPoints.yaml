documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has enough combo points to satisfy a given requirement
  description: The HasComboPoints method determines whether the EnergyComboResource
    object currently holds at least the specified number of combo points. This is
    commonly used in combat scenarios where abilities require a minimum number of
    combo points to be executed. The method evaluates the current combo point count
    against the provided amount and returns true if the requirement is met, false
    otherwise. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this typically relates
    to rogue and other combo-point-based classes that consume energy or combo points
    for special attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current combo point count is greater than or equal
    to the specified amount; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetEnergyComboResource()->HasComboPoints(5)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has at least 5 combo points\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_VANISH, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Execution
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target && player->GetEnergyComboResource()->HasComboPoints(3))\
      \ {\n    // Execute finisher ability if 3 or more combo points available\n \
      \   player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ENERGY_BOLT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the combo point count. It's a read-only check
    that can be used in conditional logic to determine if an ability can be cast or
    if certain actions are allowed based on available combo points.
