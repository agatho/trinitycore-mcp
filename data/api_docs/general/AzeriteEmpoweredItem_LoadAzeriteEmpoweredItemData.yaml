  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: LoadAzeriteEmpoweredItemData
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::LoadAzeriteEmpoweredItemData(const int * owner,
    int & azeriteEmpoweredItem)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads Azerite empowered item data for a given player or item
    context.
  description: The LoadAzeriteEmpoweredItemData method is responsible for loading
    and initializing the Azerite empowered item data associated with a specific item
    or player. This method likely retrieves stored Azerite-related information such
    as unlocked powers, levels, and progression from the database or internal structures.
    It is typically invoked during item initialization, player login, or when Azerite
    data needs to be refreshed in memory. The method requires an owner reference (likely
    a player GUID or item instance) and an Azerite empowered item identifier to correctly
    load the appropriate data. This functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate
    Azerite power states and ensuring proper gameplay mechanics related to Azerite
    progression.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner of the Azerite empowered
      item, typically a player GUID or item instance identifier. Must be a valid reference
      to ensure correct data loading.
  - name: azeriteEmpoweredItem
    description: Reference to an integer that holds the identifier for the Azerite
      empowered item being loaded. This value is updated with the loaded data upon
      successful execution of the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading Azerite Data for a Player's Item
    code: 'int playerGUID = 12345;

      int itemID = 67890;

      AzeriteEmpoweredItem azeriteItem;

      azeriteItem.LoadAzeriteEmpoweredItemData(&playerGUID, itemID);

      // Now itemID contains the loaded Azerite empowered item data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to fetch stored Azerite data.
    It may also perform validation checks on the owner and item identifiers to ensure
    data integrity. The method should be called after the player or item has been
    initialized but before any Azerite-related operations are performed.
  warnings: Ensure that the owner parameter points to a valid entity (player or item)
    to prevent undefined behavior. Improper handling of the azeriteEmpoweredItem reference
    may lead to data corruption or incorrect Azerite state.
