documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit is classified as a caster class.
  description: The IsCaster method evaluates if the current unit controlled by the
    PvPCombatAI is categorized as a caster. This classification typically applies
    to classes such as Mages, Warlocks, Priests, and Shamans, which primarily use
    spells and abilities that require mana. The method returns true if the unit's
    class type matches those designated as casters within the TrinityCore framework.
    It may be used during AI decision-making processes to determine appropriate spell
    usage or behavior patterns for PvP combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is classified as a caster, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (pvpCombatAI->IsCaster()) {\n    // Use spell-based abilities\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n} else {\n    // Use melee or ranged attacks\n   \
      \ unit->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal class type tracking within the AI system.
    It assumes that the unit has been properly initialized with a valid class type.
    The implementation may vary depending on how classes are defined in the TrinityCore
    database and core logic.
