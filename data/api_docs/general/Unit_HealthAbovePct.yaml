  class: Unit
  method: HealthAbovePct
  signature: bool Unit::HealthAbovePct(int32 pct) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit's health percentage is above a specified threshold.
  description: This method evaluates whether the current health of a Unit (such as
    a player or creature) is greater than the specified percentage value. It is commonly
    used in AI scripts and game logic to determine if a unit has sufficient health
    to perform certain actions or to trigger specific behaviors. The method returns
    true when the health percentage exceeds the given threshold, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for implementing conditional logic in various
    game mechanics, including combat strategies, healing decisions, and NPC behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's current health percentage is above the specified
    threshold, false otherwise. The method does not return null or error values as
    it is a boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HealthAbovePct(30)) {\n    // Do something when health is above\
      \ 30%\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage in AI context
    code: "if (unit->HealthAbovePct(50) && unit->GetVictim()) {\n    // Execute a\
      \ spell or ability when health is above 50% and unit has a target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally uses the unit's current health value and total maximum
    health to calculate percentage. It is thread-safe as it only reads data without
    modifying it. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight since it performs simple
    arithmetic operations.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in AI scripts where health percentages
    may fluctuate rapidly due to damage or healing. Be cautious when using this method
    in combination with other health-related methods that might conflict or cause
    logical inconsistencies.
