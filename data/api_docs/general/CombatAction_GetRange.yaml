  class: CombatAction
  method: GetRange
  signature: float CombatAction::GetRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum combat range for the current combat action.
  description: The GetRange method retrieves the effective range value used for determining
    whether a target is within valid combat distance. This range is typically derived
    from the action's associated spell, weapon, or ability properties. The returned
    float value represents the distance in yards. This method is commonly used by
    AI systems and combat logic to evaluate if a target is reachable for attack or
    spell casting. The value may be influenced by factors such as the caster's stance,
    movement state, or specific game mechanics like ranged weapon requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum combat range in yards. This value
    indicates the distance beyond which the action cannot be effectively performed
    against a target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "float range = combatAction->GetRange();\nif (target->GetDistance(this)\
      \ <= range)\n{\n    // Perform attack or cast spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Range Validation for Spell Casting
    code: "float actionRange = combatAction->GetRange();\nfloat targetDistance = unit->GetDistance(target);\n\
      if (targetDistance <= actionRange && targetDistance >= 0.0f)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with distance calculations to
    determine if a combat action can be performed on a given target. The range value
    may vary depending on the specific type of CombatAction being executed, such as
    melee attacks, ranged attacks, or spell-based abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatAction object is properly initialized before calling
    GetRange(), as accessing an uninitialized or invalid action may result in undefined
    behavior. Additionally, this method does not account for dynamic environmental
    factors like terrain or obstacles that might affect actual combat effectiveness.
