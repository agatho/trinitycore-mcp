  signature: const CombatMetrics & CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetCombatMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the combat metrics object for this behavior
    integration.
  description: The GetCombatMetrics method provides access to the combat-related statistics
    and data associated with a specific combat behavior integration. This method returns
    a const reference to a CombatMetrics object, which typically contains information
    such as damage dealt, healing done, time spent in combat, and other relevant metrics
    that track the entity's performance during combat interactions. The returned reference
    ensures that the caller cannot modify the internal state of the combat metrics,
    maintaining data integrity. This method is commonly used by AI systems, combat
    loggers, or performance analyzers to retrieve real-time combat statistics without
    exposing internal implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a CombatMetrics object containing combat-related
    statistics and performance data for this behavior integration. The reference remains
    valid as long as the parent CombatBehaviorIntegration object exists.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Metrics in AI Logic
    code: "void MyCombatAI::Update()\n{\n    const CombatMetrics& metrics = m_combatBehavior->GetCombatMetrics();\n\
      \    if (metrics.GetTotalDamageDealt() > 1000)\n    {\n        // Trigger special\
      \ ability when damage threshold is met\n        UseSpecialAbility();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Combat Statistics
    code: "void CombatLogger::LogCombatStats(CombatBehaviorIntegration* behavior)\n\
      {\n    const CombatMetrics& metrics = behavior->GetCombatMetrics();\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      combat\", \"Player dealt {} damage and received {} damage in {} seconds\",\n\
      \             metrics.GetTotalDamageDealt(),\n             metrics.GetTotalDamageTaken(),\n\
      \             metrics.GetCombatDuration());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned CombatMetrics reference is only valid while the parent CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object remains alive. This method does not perform any locking or synchronization,
    so access from multiple threads should be handled carefully. The combat metrics
    are updated in real-time during combat events and may change between calls to
    this method.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the CombatMetrics object through the returned
    reference as it is const. If you need to modify combat data, use appropriate setter
    methods on the parent CombatBehaviorIntegration class instead. Be cautious when
    caching references to combat metrics across multiple frames or updates as they
    may be invalidated during combat events.
