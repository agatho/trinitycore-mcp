documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceLockUpdateEvent object and releases its associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the InstanceLockUpdateEvent class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the event
    instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this event
    likely represents a notification or update related to instance lock states, such
    as when a player enters or exits an instance, or when instance locks are modified.
    The destructor ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures and prevents
    memory leaks. This method is automatically invoked when an InstanceLockUpdateEvent
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InstanceLockUpdateEvent
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    InstanceLockUpdateEvent event;\n    // ...\
      \ use event ...\n    // event is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to understand that this is a destructor, so it's automatically
    invoked during object lifetime management and does not need explicit calls.
