  class: FriendInfo
  method: FriendInfo
  signature: void FriendInfo::FriendInfo(const int & accountGuid, uint8 flags, const
    std::string & note)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a FriendInfo object with account GUID, flags, and note.
  description: The FriendInfo constructor initializes a friend entry with the specified
    account GUID, flags indicating friend status or relationship type, and an optional
    note associated with the friend. This method is typically used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to manage player friendship lists and their metadata. The
    flags parameter may contain information about the friend's online status, relationship
    type (e.g., friend, ignored), or other system-defined attributes. The note field
    allows players to add custom text descriptions for their friends, such as nicknames
    or personal notes.
  parameters:
  - name: accountGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player's account. This is typically
      a 32-bit integer used to uniquely identify the player across the game world.
  - name: flags
    description: Bitfield containing flags that define the friend's status and relationship
      type. Common values include online status, ignored status, or special relationship
      indicators defined by the TrinityCore framework.
  - name: note
    description: A string note associated with the friend entry. This can be used
      to store custom information about the friend, such as a nickname or personal
      message.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize FriendInfo with basic parameters
    code: 'FriendInfo friend(123456, 0x01, "Best friend");

      // Creates a friend entry for account GUID 123456 with online flag and note'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal friendship management system in
    TrinityCore. It's typically called when loading or creating friend entries from
    the database, and should not be used directly by external code unless implementing
    custom friend list functionality.
  warnings: The flags parameter must be properly set according to TrinityCore's friend
    system conventions; incorrect flag values may result in unexpected behavior in
    friend list display or functionality. The note field is stored in the database
    and should be sanitized to prevent SQL injection or other security issues if user
    input is involved.
