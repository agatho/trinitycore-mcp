documentation:
  brief: Returns the phase shift value of the WorldObject, which determines its visibility
    and interaction within specific game phases.
  description: The GetPhaseShift method retrieves the current phase shift value associated
    with a WorldObject. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, phase shifts
    control which players or creatures can see and interact with an object based on
    game phase mechanics. This is commonly used for managing visibility during quests,
    events, or instance-specific content where certain objects should only be visible
    to players in specific phases. The returned integer represents a bitmask or phase
    identifier that determines the object's active phase context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current phase shift
    value of the WorldObject. This value typically functions as a bitmask or phase
    identifier used internally by the game engine to determine visibility and interaction
    rules for the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int phase = unit->GetPhaseShift();\nif (phase == 1)\n{\n    // Object is\
      \ visible in phase 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Phase Visibility
    code: "const int& currentPhase = player->GetPhaseShift();\nif (currentPhase &\
      \ PHASE_MASK_QUEST_COMPLETE)\n{\n    // Player can see objects in quest completion\
      \ phase\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of the WorldObject
    class. Modifying this value directly should be done with caution as it may affect
    visibility and interaction behavior. Phase shifts are typically managed through
    the game's phase system rather than being modified directly.
  warnings: Direct modification of the phase shift value can cause unexpected visibility
    issues or break phase-based quest mechanics. Always use proper phase management
    functions when changing object phases rather than modifying this value directly.
