  class: SmartAIMgr
  method: GetSummonCreatureSpellContainerBounds
  signature: CacheSpellContainerBounds SmartAIMgr::GetSummonCreatureSpellContainerBounds(uint32
    creatureEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell container bounds for summon creature spells associated
    with a given creature entry.
  description: This method fetches the cached spell container bounds that define the
    valid range of summon creature spells for a specific creature entry. It is used
    internally by the SmartAI system to manage and validate spell usage during AI
    behavior execution. The returned CacheSpellContainerBounds object contains information
    about the minimum and maximum spell IDs allowed for summons, ensuring proper spell
    selection within the context of creature-specific AI logic. This method does not
    perform any dynamic lookup or calculation; instead, it returns pre-computed bounds
    from an internal cache structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CacheSpellContainerBounds object containing the minimum and maximum spell
    IDs for summon creature spells associated with the specified creature entry. Returns
    empty bounds if no data is found for the given creature entry.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve summon spell bounds for a specific creature
    code: "SmartAIMgr* smartAI = sSmartAIMgr;\nCacheSpellContainerBounds bounds =\
      \ smartAI->GetSummonCreatureSpellContainerBounds(12345);\nif (bounds.first !=\
      \ 0 || bounds.second != 0) {\n    // Valid bounds found\n    printf(\"Min spell\
      \ ID: %u, Max spell ID: %u\\n\", bounds.first, bounds.second);\n} else {\n \
      \   // No bounds defined for this creature\n    printf(\"No summon spell bounds\
      \ found for creature entry 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached data structure and is therefore fast. The cache
    should be populated during server startup or when creature templates are loaded.
    This method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable cached data.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned CacheSpellContainerBounds object directly,
    as it's a reference to internal cached data. Any changes would affect all subsequent
    accesses to that bounds data.
