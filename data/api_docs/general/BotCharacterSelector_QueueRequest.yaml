documentation:
  brief: Queues a character selection request for bot management
  description: The QueueRequest method is used to schedule a character selection operation
    within the BotCharacterSelector class. This method allows bots to request access
    to specific character slots or perform character-related operations in a queued
    manner. The request parameter defines the type of operation to be performed, while
    the callback parameter specifies how the result should be handled once processed.
    This functionality is essential for managing multiple bot characters efficiently
    and ensuring proper synchronization of character selection tasks within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: An integer value representing the type of character selection request
      to queue. Valid values typically correspond to specific bot character operations
      such as login, logout, or slot management. The exact meaning depends on the
      implementation and may be defined by constants within the BotCharacterSelector
      class.
  - name: callback
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which callback function should
      handle the result of this request. This allows for asynchronous processing where
      different types of character operations can trigger different response handlers
      based on their callback ID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Selection Request
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      int requestType = 1; // Example: login request

      int callbackId = 0; // Default callback

      selector.QueueRequest(requestType, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Bot Character Management
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      // Queue multiple character operations

      selector.QueueRequest(2, 1); // Logout request with callback 1

      selector.QueueRequest(3, 2); // Slot switch request with callback 2

      selector.QueueRequest(1, 0); // Login request with default callback'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for asynchronous character management and should
    be used in conjunction with appropriate callback handlers. The queue system ensures
    that character selection operations are processed in order without blocking the
    main game thread. Developers should ensure that all request types and callback
    identifiers are properly defined within their bot implementation.
  warnings: Improper use of request values or callback IDs may lead to undefined behavior
    or failed character operations. Ensure that all bot character requests are valid
    according to the expected enum values or constants defined in the BotCharacterSelector
    class.
