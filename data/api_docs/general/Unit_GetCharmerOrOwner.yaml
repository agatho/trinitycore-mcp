documentation:
  brief: Returns the charmer or owner of this unit, if any.
  description: The GetCharmerOrOwner method retrieves the Unit that is currently controlling
    or owning the calling unit. This method is commonly used in the context of pet
    and player relationships within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. It
    returns a pointer to the Unit that owns or controls the current unit, which may
    be a player, creature, or another unit. If no charmer or owner exists, this method
    returns nullptr. The method is essential for understanding the relationship between
    units in the game, particularly when dealing with summoned creatures or pets that
    are controlled by players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit that owns or controls the current unit. If
    no charmer or owner exists, it returns nullptr. The returned pointer may be null
    if the unit is not currently controlled by another unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* owner = unit->GetCharmerOrOwner();\nif (owner)\n{\n    // Do something\
      \ with the owner\n    std::cout << \"Owner is: \" << owner->GetName() << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No owner exists\n    std::cout << \"No owner found\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may return nullptr in cases where
    the unit is not controlled by another unit. It's important to check for null before
    using the returned pointer to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: The method can return nullptr if no charmer or owner exists, which may
    lead to null pointer dereferences if not properly checked. Always ensure that
    the returned pointer is valid before attempting to use it.
