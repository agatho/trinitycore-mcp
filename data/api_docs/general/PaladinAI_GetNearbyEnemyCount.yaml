  class: PaladinAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: int PaladinAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are within the given range of the PaladinAI's
    owner. This method is typically used by AI logic to determine optimal spell casting,
    movement decisions, or combat strategies based on enemy density. The range parameter
    defines the maximum distance in yards from the AI's current position to consider
    for counting enemies. The method performs a radius-based search and includes all
    valid enemy targets that are not currently dead or invisible.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards to search for nearby enemies. Must
      be a positive floating-point value representing the radius of the search area.
  returns: An integer value representing the count of enemy units found within the
    specified range. Returns zero if no enemies are detected or if the input range
    is invalid (negative).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Enemy Density
    code: "int enemyCount = ai->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount >= 3)\
      \ {\n    // Execute area-of-effect spell\n    ai->CastSpell(SpellId::DivineStorm);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Combat Decision Based on Enemy Count
    code: "float range = 15.0f;\nint enemies = ai->GetNearbyEnemyCount(range);\nif\
      \ (enemies > 0) {\n    if (enemies <= 2) {\n        ai->CastSpell(SpellId::JudgementOfLight);\n\
      \    } else {\n        ai->CastSpell(SpellId::Consecration);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal target tracking system and may not
    account for all possible visibility or obstruction conditions. It is recommended
    to use reasonable range values (typically between 5-30 yards) to avoid performance
    issues with excessive calculations. The method does not consider line-of-sight
    restrictions; it only checks distance.
  warnings: Using very large range values can cause performance degradation due to
    increased number of unit checks. Ensure that the range parameter is always positive,
    as negative values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
