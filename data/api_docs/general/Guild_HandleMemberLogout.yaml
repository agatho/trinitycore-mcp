documentation:
  brief: Handles the logout event of a guild member by updating their online status
    and notifying other guild members.
  description: The HandleMemberLogout method is responsible for processing the logout
    of a guild member within the TrinityCore framework. When a player logs out, this
    method updates the guild member's online status to offline, removes them from
    the list of online members, and broadcasts a notification to all other online
    guild members about the logout event. This ensures that the guild's internal state
    accurately reflects the current online status of its members and provides real-time
    updates to the guild interface in the game client.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetGuild())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetGuild()->HandleMemberLogout(player->GetSession());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core when a player
    session ends. It assumes that the guild member has already been validated as part
    of a valid guild. The method does not perform any direct database operations but
    relies on internal guild state management.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain about the player's
    guild membership and session validity. Improper usage may lead to inconsistent
    guild state or incorrect notifications being sent to other players.
