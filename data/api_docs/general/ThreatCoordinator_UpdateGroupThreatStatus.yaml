  method: UpdateGroupThreatStatus
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::UpdateGroupThreatStatus()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat status for all group members in the current threat coordinator.
  description: The UpdateGroupThreatStatus method synchronizes and recalculates the
    threat levels of all players within a group, ensuring that each member's current
    threat value is accurately reflected in the threat system. This method is typically
    invoked during combat events or when group composition changes to maintain accurate
    threat tracking for mob aggro mechanics. It ensures that the threat coordinator
    maintains up-to-date information about which group members are generating the
    most threat and thus potentially attracting enemy attention.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler::OnCombatUpdate()\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator* coordinator\
      \ = player->GetThreatCoordinator();\n    if (coordinator)\n        coordinator->UpdateGroupThreatStatus();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal recalculations of threat tables and should
    not be called excessively during high-frequency combat events. It is designed
    to be lightweight but does involve iterating through all group members.
