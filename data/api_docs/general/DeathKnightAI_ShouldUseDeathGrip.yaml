  method: ShouldUseDeathGrip
  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::ShouldUseDeathGrip(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Death Knight should use Death Grip on a target.
  description: The ShouldUseDeathGrip method evaluates if the Death Knight AI should
    initiate the Death Grip ability against a specified target. This decision is based
    on various combat conditions such as target distance, threat level, and the presence
    of other mechanics that might interfere with the ability's effectiveness. The
    method ensures optimal use of Death Grip within the context of the Death Knight's
    tactical gameplay, particularly in situations where pulling enemies closer or
    interrupting their actions is beneficial.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight should use Death Grip on the target; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->ShouldUseDeathGrip(target)) {\n    // Execute Death\
      \ Grip\n    deathKnightAI->DoCast(target, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\
      \ {\n        if (ShouldUseDeathGrip(target)) {\n            DoCast(target, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the Death Knight's AI update loop to
    make tactical decisions. It considers factors like target proximity and threat
    level but does not directly handle spell casting or cooldowns.
  warnings: Ensure that the target unit is valid before calling this method, as invalid
    targets may lead to unexpected behavior. The method assumes that the Death Knight
    has sufficient mana and that Death Grip is not on cooldown.
