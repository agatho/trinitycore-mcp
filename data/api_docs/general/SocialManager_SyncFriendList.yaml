  brief: Synchronizes the player's friend list with the server
  description: The SyncFriendList method ensures that the local friend list stored
    in the SocialManager is consistent with the authoritative friend list maintained
    by the TrinityCore server. This method typically handles the reconciliation of
    any discrepancies between the client-side and server-side friend data, including
    adding new friends, removing deleted entries, and updating friend statuses such
    as online/offline status or location information. It may also trigger updates
    to the player's social UI components to reflect the synchronized state.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SyncFriendList();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during login or when the player's
    social data needs refreshing. It may involve network communication with the server,
    so calling it frequently could impact performance.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops as it may cause unnecessary
    network traffic and potential performance degradation. Ensure that the player
    object is valid before invoking this method.
