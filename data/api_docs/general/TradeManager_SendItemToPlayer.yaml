  signature: bool TradeManager::SendItemToPlayer(Item * item, Player * recipient)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an item to a player, handling the transfer and updating the player's
    inventory.
  description: The SendItemToPlayer method is responsible for transferring an Item
    object to a specified Player recipient within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method ensures that the item is properly added to the player's inventory, updates
    the necessary game state, and handles any related notifications or events required
    for the item transfer. It typically involves checking inventory space, updating
    item ownership, and potentially sending client updates to reflect the new item
    in the player's possession. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether
    the operation was successful.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object that is to be sent to the player. Must
      not be null and must represent a valid item instance.
  - name: recipient
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the item. Must not
      be null and must represent a valid player instance.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully sent to the player, including
    proper inventory update and client notification. Returns false if the operation
    failed due to invalid parameters, insufficient inventory space, or other internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Transfer
    code: "Item* item = ...; // Assume valid item\nPlayer* player = ...; // Assume\
      \ valid player\nbool success = TradeManager::SendItemToPlayer(item, player);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Item successfully sent\n} else {\n    // Handle failure\
      \ case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Item Transfer with Error Handling
    code: "Item* item = ...; // Assume valid item\nPlayer* player = ...; // Assume\
      \ valid player\nif (item && player) {\n    bool result = TradeManager::SendItemToPlayer(item,\
      \ player);\n    if (!result) {\n        // Log error or notify GM\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to send item to player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n} else\
      \ {\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid item or player pointer provided\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in trade systems, quest rewards, or other game
    mechanics where items need to be transferred from one entity to another. The implementation
    may involve checks for inventory limits and could trigger client-side updates
    to reflect the new item in the player's UI. It is recommended to ensure that both
    the item and player pointers are valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null pointers as it will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the item being sent is properly initialized
    and has a valid owner or is a newly created item. This method does not validate
    if the recipient can actually receive the item (e.g., due to level restrictions,
    class restrictions, etc.), so additional checks may be required before calling.
