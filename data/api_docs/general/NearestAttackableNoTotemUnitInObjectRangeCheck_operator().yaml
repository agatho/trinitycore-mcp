documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a unit is attackable and within range, excluding totems.
  description: The operator() method of NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck
    performs a predicate check on a given unit pointer to determine if it is an attackable
    target that is within the specified range, while excluding totems from consideration.
    This class is typically used in AI decision-making processes where NPCs need to
    identify valid targets for attacks or abilities. The method evaluates various
    conditions such as faction relationships, visibility, and whether the unit is
    a totem before returning a boolean result indicating if the unit meets all criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit pointed to by 'u' is attackable, within range,
    and not a totem; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI target selection
    code: 'NearestAttackableNoTotemUnitInObjectRangeCheck checker(creature, range);

      bool isValidTarget = checker(&targetUnit);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used within TrinityCore's AI framework for selecting
    valid attack targets. It assumes that the object has already been initialized
    with appropriate parameters such as the caster unit and range values.
