documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CUFProfile with specified frame dimensions, sorting options,
    health text display, boolean flags, and positioning parameters.
  description: The CUFProfile constructor initializes a new unit frame profile for
    use in the World of Warcraft UI system. This method sets up various properties
    such as frame size, sorting behavior, health text type, boolean configuration
    flags, and positional offsets. It is used to define how player and NPC unit frames
    are displayed within the game's user interface. The parameters control visual
    layout, data display order, and functional settings for unit frames. This constructor
    typically gets called when creating custom unit frame profiles or modifying existing
    ones through the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier name for this CUFProfile, used to distinguish
      it from other profiles in the system.
  - name: frameHeight
    description: The height of the unit frame in pixels. Valid range is typically
      0-1000 units depending on UI scaling.
  - name: frameWidth
    description: The width of the unit frame in pixels. Valid range is typically 0-1000
      units depending on UI scaling.
  - name: sortBy
    description: Determines the sorting method for unit frames (e.g., by health, mana,
      or name). Values are usually predefined constants like SORT_BY_HEALTH = 0, SORT_BY_MANA
      = 1, etc.
  - name: healthText
    description: 'Controls how health information is displayed on the frame. Possible
      values include: 0 = none, 1 = percentage, 2 = current/maximum, 3 = deficit.'
  - name: boolOptions
    description: A bitmask of boolean configuration options that control various frame
      behaviors such as visibility, alerts, and animations. Each bit represents a
      different setting.
  - name: topPoint
    description: Defines the vertical anchor point for positioning the top edge of
      the frame (e.g., TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM).
  - name: bottomPoint
    description: Defines the vertical anchor point for positioning the bottom edge
      of the frame (e.g., TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM).
  - name: leftPoint
    description: Defines the horizontal anchor point for positioning the left edge
      of the frame (e.g., LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT).
  - name: topOffset
    description: Vertical offset in pixels from the top anchor point. Positive values
      move the frame down.
  - name: bottomOffset
    description: Vertical offset in pixels from the bottom anchor point. Positive
      values move the frame up.
  - name: leftOffset
    description: Horizontal offset in pixels from the left anchor point. Positive
      values move the frame right.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CUFProfile Initialization
    code: CUFProfile myProfile("PlayerFrame", 80, 200, 0, 1, 0x0001, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
      0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced CUFProfile with Custom Positioning
    code: CUFProfile raidFrame("RaidMember", 60, 150, 1, 2, 0x0007, 3, 3, 3, -10,
      10, -20);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when loading unit frame configurations from database or configuration files. The
    profile name should be unique within the system to prevent conflicts. Boolean
    options are often defined as bit flags where each bit corresponds to a specific
    feature like 'show health bar', 'enable alerts', etc.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can lead to display issues or UI corruption.
    For example, setting frame dimensions to zero will result in invisible frames.
    The booleanOptions bitmask must be carefully constructed to avoid unintended behavior.
