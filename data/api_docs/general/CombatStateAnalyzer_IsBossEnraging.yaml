  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::IsBossEnraging() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current combat state indicates that a boss is entering
    its enrage phase.
  description: The IsBossEnraging method evaluates the current combat state to determine
    if a boss enemy is about to enter or has entered its enrage phase. This typically
    occurs when a boss reaches a certain health threshold, triggering a mechanic where
    the boss becomes significantly more aggressive and deals increased damage. The
    method checks internal flags or state variables within the CombatStateAnalyzer
    class that track the boss's combat status and enrage condition. It is commonly
    used by AI systems to adjust behavior patterns, such as changing attack priorities
    or initiating defensive measures when an enrage event is detected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the boss is currently in an enraging state or about to
    enter one; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (analyzer.IsBossEnraging()) {\n    // Switch to defensive stance\n \
      \   ai->SetCombatStyle(DEFENSIVE);\n    // Increase alertness\n    ai->SetAlertLevel(ALERT_HIGH);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Event Handling
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (combatAnalyzer.IsBossEnraging())\
      \ {\n        // Apply enrage-specific effects\n        DoCast(SPELL_ENRAGE_EFFECT);\n\
      \        // Modify attack speed\n        me->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 1.5f);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the CombatStateAnalyzer
    which must be properly initialized and updated during combat events. The enrage
    detection logic may vary depending on the specific boss type and encounter mechanics
    implemented in the TrinityCore version.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatStateAnalyzer instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as uninitialized or improperly updated state variables can
    lead to incorrect return values. This method should not be used outside of active
    combat scenarios where boss enrage conditions are relevant.
