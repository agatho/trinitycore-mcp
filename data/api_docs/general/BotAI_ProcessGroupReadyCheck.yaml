documentation:
  brief: Processes group ready check events for bot AI behavior.
  description: The ProcessGroupReadyCheck method handles group ready check events
    within the BotAI system. It evaluates the current state of the group and determines
    appropriate responses based on the event data. This method is typically invoked
    when a group member initiates a ready check, ensuring that bots respond appropriately
    to maintain group cohesion and readiness for activities such as dungeons or raids.
    The method integrates with the broader AI decision-making framework to ensure
    coordinated group behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing details about the ready check, including
      the initiator, group state, and any relevant timing information.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is part of the bot AI subsystem and should only be called within
    the context of group events. It assumes that the bot has been properly initialized
    with group membership information.
