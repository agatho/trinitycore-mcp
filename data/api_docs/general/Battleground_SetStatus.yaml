  class: Battleground
  method: SetStatus
  signature: void Battleground::SetStatus(BattlegroundStatus Status)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current status of the battleground to the specified value.
  description: The SetStatus method updates the internal status field of a battleground
    instance, which controls various aspects of the battleground's lifecycle including
    initialization, active gameplay, and cleanup phases. This method is typically
    invoked during battleground start, end, and transition events to manage the state
    machine that governs how players interact with the battleground environment. The
    status value determines what operations are allowed and how the battleground handles
    player entries, exits, scoring, and rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: Status
    description: The BattlegroundStatus enum value representing the new state of the
      battleground. Valid values typically include STATUS_WAIT_QUEUE, STATUS_WAIT_JOIN,
      STATUS_IN_PROGRESS, STATUS_DONE, and STATUS_NONE depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting battleground to in-progress status
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->SetStatus(BattlegroundStatus::STATUS_IN_PROGRESS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Ending a battleground by setting done status
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->SetStatus(BattlegroundStatus::STATUS_DONE);\n    bg->EndBattleground(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\
      \ // Example of subsequent cleanup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the battleground's internal state and should
    only be called from within the battleground management system or during controlled
    transitions. The status change may trigger additional events or callbacks that
    affect player experience and game logic.
  warnings: Calling SetStatus with an invalid or inappropriate status value can lead
    to undefined behavior or game state corruption. Always ensure the status transition
    is valid according to the battleground's current state and rules.
