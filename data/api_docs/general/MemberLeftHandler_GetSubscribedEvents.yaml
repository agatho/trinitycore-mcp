  class: MemberLeftHandler
  method: GetSubscribedEvents
  signature: int MemberLeftHandler::GetSubscribedEvents() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to in the group
    member left event system.
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method retrieves the bitmask representing all
    events that this MemberLeftHandler instance is registered to handle. In TrinityCore's
    group management system, when a player leaves a group, various subsystems may
    need to be notified or perform cleanup operations. This method allows the handler
    to declare which specific events it wishes to receive notifications for. The return
    value typically represents a combination of event flags defined by the system,
    enabling efficient routing and processing of group-related events without requiring
    each handler to check all possible events individually.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask indicating the subscribed events. Each bit in the returned
    integer corresponds to a specific event type that this handler is interested in.
    The exact meaning of each bit must be determined by consulting the relevant event
    flag definitions within the TrinityCore codebase, typically found in group-related
    header files or event handler interfaces.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MemberLeftHandler* handler = new MyGroupMemberHandler();\nint subscribedEvents\
      \ = handler->GetSubscribedEvents();\nif (subscribedEvents & GROUP_EVENT_MEMBER_LEFT)\n\
      {\n    // Handle member left event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization or registration
    phase of an event handler. The returned bitmask should be treated as read-only
    and should not be modified directly by client code. Implementations may cache
    this value for performance reasons, especially if the subscription set does not
    change at runtime.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned bitmask directly as it represents a constant
    subscription set. Incorrectly interpreting or modifying the bitmask can lead to
    missed events or unexpected behavior in group management systems. Ensure that
    all event flags used in the bitmask are properly defined and consistent with the
    current TrinityCore version.
