  signature: bool MapEntry::IsBattleground() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry represents a battleground.
  description: The IsBattleground method checks if the current MapEntry object corresponds
    to a battleground type map. This is useful for identifying maps that are specifically
    designed for competitive player-versus-player combat, such as Alterac Valley or
    Warsong Gulch. The method returns true if the map is classified as a battleground,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for game logic that needs
    to differentiate between regular world maps and specialized PvP arenas.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry represents a battleground; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (mapEntry->IsBattleground()) {\n    // Handle battleground-specific\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"This is a battleground map\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Map Loading
    code: "Map* map = sMapMgr->CreateMap(mapId, player);\nif (map && map->GetEntry()->IsBattleground())\
      \ {\n    // Apply battleground-specific settings\n    map->SetBattleground(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal map type flags set during server initialization.
    It's recommended to cache the result of this check if it's used frequently in
    performance-critical code paths.
