  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::IsCasting() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is currently casting a spell or ability.
  description: The IsCasting method determines whether the CombatSpecializationBase
    instance (typically a player or creature) is in the process of casting a spell
    or ability. This method returns true if the unit has an active cast in progress,
    and false otherwise. It is commonly used in combat AI logic to prevent actions
    while a unit is casting, or to delay certain abilities until after a cast completes.
    The check considers both regular spell casts and channeled abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently casting a spell or ability; returns
    false if no cast is in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to prevent actions during casting
    code: "if (!player->IsCasting()) {\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    // Do not cast while already casting\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Cannot cast while already casting.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsCasting in combat AI logic
    code: "if (enemy->IsCasting()) {\n    // Avoid melee attacks while enemy is casting\n\
      \    ai->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n} else {\n    // Normal combat behavior\n\
      \    ai->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method checks the internal cast state of the unit and does not account
    for external interruptions or modifications to the casting process. It is typically
    used in conjunction with other combat-related methods such as IsNonMeleeSpellCasted()
    or HasUnitState(). The method is thread-safe and can be safely called from both
    main and worker threads.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only reflects the current casting state and
    does not prevent a unit from being interrupted mid-cast. Also, some spells may
    not immediately update their casting state upon completion, so it's important
    to consider timing when using this in real-time combat logic.
