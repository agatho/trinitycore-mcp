documentation:
  brief: Resets the PvP combat timer for the referenced player
  description: The RefreshTimer method resets the internal PvP combat timer associated
    with a player reference, effectively extending their PvP combat duration. This
    is typically called when a player remains in active PvP combat to prevent them
    from automatically exiting the PvP state. The method ensures that the player's
    PvP status remains active until the combat timer expires naturally or is otherwise
    cleared. This mechanism helps maintain fair play by preventing players from quickly
    escaping PvP combat by simply stopping all actions.

  - title: Refreshing PvP Combat Timer
    code: "PvPCombatReference* pvpRef = player->GetPvPCombatReference();\nif (pvpRef)\n\
      {\n    pvpRef->RefreshTimer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core PvP system when a
    player performs actions that maintain PvP combat status, such as dealing damage
    or receiving damage. It's important to note that calling this method does not
    directly affect the player's combat state, but rather resets the timer that governs
    how long they remain in PvP combat.
