  brief: Evaluates and returns the current health status of the system
  description: The GetSystemHealth method performs a comprehensive assessment of the
    system's operational state, checking various critical components such as memory
    usage, CPU load, network connectivity, and core service availability. It aggregates
    these metrics to determine an overall health status that reflects the stability
    and performance of the TrinityCore server environment. This method is typically
    used by monitoring systems, automated failover mechanisms, or administrative tools
    to make informed decisions about system maintenance or resource allocation. The
    returned HealthStatus enum provides a standardized way to interpret the system's
    condition without requiring detailed metric inspection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a HealthStatus enumeration value indicating the current system
    health state. Possible values include HEALTH_OK, HEALTH_WARNING, HEALTH_CRITICAL,
    or HEALTH_UNKNOWN depending on the severity of detected issues. The method will
    never return null or undefined states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Health Check Usage
    code: "BotHealthCheck healthChecker;\nHealthStatus status = healthChecker.GetSystemHealth();\n\
      if (status == HEALTH_OK) {\n    // System is operating normally\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      server\", \"System health is optimal\");\n} else if (status == HEALTH_CRITICAL)\
      \ {\n    // Immediate action required\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Critical\
      \ system failure detected\");\n}"

  - title: Health Monitoring in Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateSystemMonitoring() {\n    static uint32 lastCheck = 0;\n   \
      \ uint32 currentTime = getMSTime();\n    \n    if (currentTime - lastCheck >\
      \ 30000) { // Check every 30 seconds\n        BotHealthCheck healthCheck;\n\
      \        HealthStatus status = healthCheck.GetSystemHealth();\n        \n  \
      \      switch (status) {\n            case HEALTH_OK:\n                // Continue\
      \ normal operations\n                break;\n            case HEALTH_WARNING:\n\
      \                // Log warning and potentially reduce load\n              \
      \  LOG_WARN(\"server\", \"System health is degraded\");\n                break;\n\
      \            case HEALTH_CRITICAL:\n                // Initiate emergency procedures\n\
      \                LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Critical system failure - initiating\
      \ shutdown\");\n                sWorld->SetActiveShutdown();\n             \
      \   break;\n        }\n        lastCheck = currentTime;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method performs a non-blocking check of system resources and should
    not introduce significant latency to the calling thread. The implementation may
    cache results for a short period to avoid excessive resource polling. The exact
    thresholds for health status determination are configurable through TrinityCore's
    configuration files or runtime settings.
  warnings: The returned HealthStatus value should not be used as the sole indicator
    for critical system decisions without proper context. Some warning conditions
    might be temporary and resolve automatically. Additionally, this method does not
    perform any corrective actions - it only reports the current state.
