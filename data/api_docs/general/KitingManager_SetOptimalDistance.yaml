  class: KitingManager
  method: SetOptimalDistance
  signature: void KitingManager::SetOptimalDistance(float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the optimal distance for kiting behavior in combat.
  description: The SetOptimalDistance method configures the target distance that a
    creature or player should maintain from an enemy during kiting gameplay. This
    distance is used by the KitingManager to determine when to move closer to or farther
    from an opponent. The value is typically expressed in yards and affects the AI's
    movement decisions during combat. This setting is crucial for proper kiting mechanics,
    especially for ranged attackers who need to maintain optimal positioning for damage
    output while avoiding melee attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: distance
    description: The desired optimal distance in yards. Must be a positive floating-point
      value. Values below 0.1 are typically treated as invalid and may result in default
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Optimal Kiting Distance
    code: "KitingManager* kiter = unit->GetKitingManager();\nif (kiter)\n{\n    kiter->SetOptimalDistance(15.0f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Kiting Distance Adjustment
    code: "void AdjustKitingDistance(Unit* unit, float newDistance)\n{\n    KitingManager*\
      \ kiter = unit->GetKitingManager();\n    if (kiter && newDistance > 0.0f)\n\
      \    {\n        kiter->SetOptimalDistance(newDistance);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the AI's decision-making process during combat.
    The optimal distance is used in conjunction with other parameters like attack
    range and movement speed to calculate appropriate positioning. Changes to this
    value take immediate effect on subsequent AI calculations.
  warnings: Setting extremely small values may cause erratic movement behavior or
    prevent proper kiting. Values that are too large might result in the unit moving
    away from combat unnecessarily, potentially causing loss of aggro or missed opportunities
    for damage.
