documentation:
  brief: Sends a calendar event invite to the specified player.
  description: The SendCalendarEventInvite method is responsible for delivering a
    calendar event invitation to a targeted player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This function typically handles the communication of event details such as the
    event name, start time, and invite status to the recipient player's client. It
    is part of the broader calendar system that allows players to organize and share
    events like raids, guild activities, or social gatherings. The method ensures
    proper synchronization of calendar data between the server and client, enabling
    real-time updates for all involved parties. This function usually operates within
    the context of a larger calendar management system and requires valid invite data
    to be passed in.
  parameters:
  - name: invite
    description: A const reference to a CalendarInvite object containing the event
      details and recipient information for the calendar invitation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of SendCalendarEventInvite
    code: 'CalendarInvite invite;

      invite.SetEventId(12345);

      invite.SetInviteeGuid(67890);

      invite.SetStatus(CALENDAR_INVITE_STATUS_PENDING);

      // Assuming calendarMgr is a valid instance of CalendarMgr

      calendarMgr.SendCalendarEventInvite(invite);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's client through network packets
    to display the calendar event invite. It may also update internal data structures
    to track invite status and ensure consistency across the server. The method should
    only be called when the invite data is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the CalendarInvite object passed to this method contains all
    required fields, particularly the invitee's GUID and event details. Failure to
    do so may result in failed invitations or client-side errors. This method should
    not be called with invalid or uninitialized invite objects.
