documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently seated on a vehicle.
  description: The IsOnVehicle method checks if a Unit object is currently mounted
    on a vehicle, returning true if the unit is seated on a vehicle and false otherwise.
    This method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine vehicle status, particularly
    when dealing with player characters or NPCs that may be riding vehicles. The method
    relies on internal vehicle seating data and can be used to verify whether a unit
    is currently in a vehicle state, which is important for various gameplay scenarios
    such as vehicle combat, movement, or interaction with vehicle mechanics. This
    method does not require any parameters and operates on the unit's current state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is seated on a vehicle, false otherwise. The return
    value represents the current vehicle mounting status of the unit, indicating whether
    the unit is currently in a vehicle seat or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsOnVehicle())\n{\n    // Player is on a vehicle\n    // Do\
      \ something with vehicle mechanics\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not on a vehicle\n\
      \    // Handle non-vehicle behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely uses internal vehicle data structures
    to determine if the unit is seated on a vehicle. Performance considerations: The
    method should be fast as it only checks current state and does not involve complex
    calculations or database queries. Thread safety: This method is generally thread-safe
    as it operates on the unit''s current state without modifying shared data.'
  warnings: 'Caution: This method may return false negatives if the unit is in a vehicle
    but not actively seated (e.g., when using vehicle mechanics but not actually mounted).
    Common mistake: Using this method to determine vehicle existence rather than vehicle
    mounting status can lead to incorrect assumptions about gameplay behavior.'
