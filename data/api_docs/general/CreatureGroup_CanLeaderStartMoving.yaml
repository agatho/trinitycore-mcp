  signature: bool CreatureGroup::CanLeaderStartMoving() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature group's leader is allowed to begin movement.
  description: The CanLeaderStartMoving method evaluates whether the current leader
    of a creature group can initiate movement. This check typically involves verifying
    that the leader is not in a state that would prevent movement, such as being engaged
    in combat, stunned, or otherwise incapacitated. It also considers the group's
    overall state and any restrictions imposed by the game logic or AI behavior system.
    The method is commonly used within the TrinityCore framework to control when creature
    groups can start moving, ensuring proper coordination between group members during
    dynamic events like patrols, formations, or scripted sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the leader of the creature group is permitted to begin
    movement; otherwise returns false. This indicates that either no restrictions
    are active on the leader or that all necessary conditions for movement have been
    satisfied.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Leader Can Start Moving
    code: "if (creatureGroup->CanLeaderStartMoving()) {\n    creatureGroup->StartMovement();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where leader cannot move\n    sLog->outDebug(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Creature group leader cannot start moving.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other movement-related checks
    within the AI system. It may be called frequently during group updates and should
    ideally have minimal performance impact. The result of this check directly affects
    whether a group will proceed with movement actions.
