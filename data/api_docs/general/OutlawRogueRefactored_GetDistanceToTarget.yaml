  method: GetDistanceToTarget
  signature: float OutlawRogueRefactored::GetDistanceToTarget(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the outlaw rogue and
    the specified target.
  description: The GetDistanceToTarget method computes the straight-line distance
    from the current outlaw rogue's position to the position of a given target unit.
    This calculation is typically used in combat decision-making, positioning logic,
    or determining whether an ability can be cast based on range requirements. The
    method requires a valid pointer to a target unit and performs no validation on
    the input, so calling code must ensure the target is not null and represents a
    valid game object. In TrinityCore's context, this distance is calculated using
    the 3D coordinates of both entities, taking into account height differences for
    accurate range measurement.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier or
      internal reference. This parameter must point to a valid target object; passing
      null or an invalid reference will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance between the rogue and
    the target in yards. Returns zero if the target is invalid or at the same location
    as the rogue. Negative values are not expected but may occur due to floating-point
    precision errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine combat range
    code: "float distance = rogue->GetDistanceToTarget(&targetGuid);\nif (distance\
      \ <= 5.0f) {\n    // Perform melee attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using distance for positioning decisions
    code: "int targetGuid = player->GetTarget();\nfloat distance = rogue->GetDistanceToTarget(&targetGuid);\n\
      if (distance > 25.0f) {\n    // Move closer or use a ranged ability\n} else\
      \ if (distance < 5.0f) {\n    // Use stealth or finisher\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct coordinate-based distance calculation and does
    not account for obstacles or terrain. It is recommended to use this in conjunction
    with other range checks that consider line-of-sight or movement restrictions.
    The method assumes the target unit has valid position data, which may not always
    be true in edge cases such as during teleportation or when the target is in an
    invalid state.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid target GUID can lead to crashes or
    incorrect results. Always validate that the target exists and is accessible before
    calling this method. The returned distance value should not be used directly for
    range-based spell casting without additional checks for line-of-sight and target
    validity.
