  method: Load
  signature: Result InstanceScriptDataReader::Load(const char * data)
documentation:
  brief: Loads instance script data from a string buffer into the reader's internal
    state
  description: The Load method parses and processes instance script data provided
    as a null-terminated character string. It initializes the reader's internal data
    structures with the parsed information, typically used during instance loading
    or restoration. The method handles validation of the input data format and may
    perform error checking to ensure data integrity. This method is commonly invoked
    when restoring instance state from saved data or initializing scripted content
    within a dungeon or raid instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Result object indicating success or failure of the load operation. The
    result typically contains status information about whether the data was successfully
    parsed and loaded, with possible error codes for malformed input or other processing
    failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Load Usage
    code: "InstanceScriptDataReader reader;\nconst char* data = \"{\\\"bosses\\\"\
      : [true, false, true], \\\"events\\\": [100, 200]}\";\nResult result = reader.Load(data);\n\
      if (result.IsSuccess()) {\n    // Data loaded successfully\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle load error\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance initialization or restoration
    phases. The data parameter should contain valid JSON-formatted strings that match
    the expected schema for the specific instance script. Thread safety depends on
    the implementation of the underlying data structures and should be verified in
    context.
  warnings: The method assumes the input string is properly null-terminated and contains
    valid data format. Passing malformed or corrupted data may result in undefined
    behavior or failed load operations. Ensure that the data buffer remains valid
    throughout the execution of this method.
