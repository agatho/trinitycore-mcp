  class: KitingManager
  method: GetCurrentState
  signature: KitingState KitingManager::GetCurrentState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current kiting state of the KitingManager instance.
  description: The GetCurrentState method returns the current kiting state of the
    KitingManager, which represents the active behavior or mode the manager is operating
    in during kiting operations. This state typically indicates whether the manager
    is currently performing actions such as moving, stopping, turning, or waiting
    for a specific condition to be met. The returned KitingState enum value provides
    insight into the internal logic flow and helps determine how the kiting system
    should behave next. This method is commonly used in AI scripts and movement controllers
    to make decisions based on the current kiting behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A KitingState enumeration value indicating the current state of the kiting
    manager. Possible values may include states like KITING_STATE_IDLE, KITING_STATE_MOVING,
    KITING_STATE_TURNING, or KITING_STATE_WAITING depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "KitingState currentState = kitingManager.GetCurrentState();\nif (currentState\
      \ == KITING_STATE_IDLE)\n{\n    // Perform idle behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: State-Based Decision Making
    code: "KitingState state = kitingManager.GetCurrentState();\nswitch (state)\n\
      {\n    case KITING_STATE_MOVING:\n        // Continue movement logic\n     \
      \   break;\n    case KITING_STATE_TURNING:\n        // Handle turning behavior\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Default handling for other states\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other kiting-related methods
    to maintain consistent kiting behavior. It's important to note that the returned
    state may change frequently during active kiting operations, so caching the result
    might lead to outdated information.
  warnings: The KitingState enum values are implementation-specific and may vary between
    different versions of TrinityCore. Always verify the actual values defined in
    your codebase before making assumptions about specific state meanings.
