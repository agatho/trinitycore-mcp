documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given area trigger ID corresponds to a tavern location
    in the game world.
  description: The IsTavernAreaTrigger method checks if a specified area trigger ID
    is associated with a tavern in the World of Warcraft game world. This functionality
    is used by the TrinityCore server to identify which area triggers are designated
    as taverns, allowing for proper handling of player interactions such as resting,
    healing, and other tavern-specific mechanics. The method likely queries an internal
    database or lookup table that maps area trigger IDs to their respective tavern
    status. It returns true if the trigger ID is recognized as a tavern area trigger,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided Trigger_ID corresponds to a tavern area trigger
    in the game world; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Area Trigger is Tavern
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsTavernAreaTrigger(5432)) {\n    // Handle tavern-specific\
      \ logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Player entered a tavern area.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the ObjectMgr's internal database lookup system
    and may be used during player movement or interaction events. It's important to
    note that the method operates on a pre-loaded set of tavern area triggers, so
    any new taverns must be properly registered in the database for this check to
    work correctly.
