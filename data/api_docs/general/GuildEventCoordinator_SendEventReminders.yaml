  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: SendEventReminders
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::SendEventReminders(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends event reminders to all guild members who are registered for the specified
    guild event.
  description: The SendEventReminders method is responsible for notifying all players
    in a guild who have signed up for a specific guild event. It iterates through
    the list of registered participants and sends them in-game messages or notifications
    about the upcoming event. This functionality supports the guild event management
    system by ensuring that members are aware of scheduled activities. The method
    likely checks if the event is within a certain time window before sending reminders,
    and may also handle cases where reminders have already been sent to avoid duplicate
    notifications. This method is typically called by the game's internal event coordinator
    or triggered automatically when an event approaches its start time.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event for which reminders should
      be sent. This ID corresponds to a specific event entry in the guild event database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending reminders for a specific guild event
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      uint32 eventId = 12345;

      coordinator.SendEventReminders(eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an automated system that handles guild event
    notifications. It may be invoked by a timer or scheduler within the game server
    to ensure timely reminders are sent. The implementation might include checks for
    player online status and guild membership to avoid sending messages to offline
    players or non-members.
  warnings: Ensure that eventId is valid before calling this method, as invalid event
    IDs could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the notification system. This
    method may be called frequently during event periods, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account for large guilds with many members.
