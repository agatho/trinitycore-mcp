  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::InitializeCombatAI()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the combat AI behavior for an enhanced bot, setting up core combat
    mechanisms and state management.
  description: The InitializeCombatAI method prepares an EnhancedBotAI instance for
    engaging in combat scenarios by configuring essential AI parameters, establishing
    combat state variables, and initializing internal data structures required for
    decision-making during fights. This method is typically invoked when a bot enters
    combat mode or when the AI system needs to be reset before initiating a new combat
    sequence. It ensures that all necessary components such as target selection logic,
    spell casting routines, and movement behaviors are properly initialized before
    any combat actions take place. The method does not accept any parameters and performs
    no direct return operations, instead modifying internal state variables of the
    EnhancedBotAI instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'EnhancedBotAI* botAI = new EnhancedBotAI();

      botAI->InitializeCombatAI();

      // Bot is now ready to engage in combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot is in a valid state for combat
    initialization. It assumes that the bot's base AI system has already been initialized
    and that required resources are available. The method may perform internal setup
    operations that could impact performance if called frequently without proper state
    management.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly configured bot instance
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all prerequisite conditions
    for combat AI initialization have been met before invoking this method.
