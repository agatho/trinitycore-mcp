  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: BotPerformanceMonitor
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::BotPerformanceMonitor()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotPerformanceMonitor class for tracking
    and analyzing bot performance metrics.
  description: The BotPerformanceMonitor constructor initializes a new instance of
    the BotPerformanceMonitor class, setting up internal data structures and state
    required for monitoring bot performance within the TrinityCore environment. This
    class is designed to collect and analyze various performance-related metrics such
    as update frequency, resource consumption, and response times for AI-controlled
    bots. The initialization process typically involves allocating memory for tracking
    data, setting default configuration values, and preparing any necessary synchronization
    primitives. This constructor should be called before attempting to use other methods
    in the class to ensure proper functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      // The monitor is now ready to track bot performance metrics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation
    that would block execution. It is intended to be lightweight and fast, allowing
    for quick instantiation of monitoring objects during bot creation or system startup.
