  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::LogPerformanceReport() const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a performance report for bot operations to the TrinityCore log system.
  description: The LogPerformanceReport method generates and outputs a detailed performance
    summary for bot activities within the TrinityCore environment. This method is
    typically invoked to record metrics such as execution times, resource usage, or
    operational efficiency of AI-driven bots. It integrates with the server's logging
    framework to ensure that performance data is persisted for monitoring and debugging
    purposes. The report includes timing information and other relevant statistics
    that help developers assess bot behavior and optimize performance.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Manager
    code: "void BotManager::OnUpdate()\n{\n    // ... bot logic ...\n    m_performanceMonitor.LogPerformanceReport();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use by the bot subsystem and should
    not be called directly from external modules unless necessary. It may involve
    performance overhead due to logging operations, so it's recommended to call it
    at appropriate intervals rather than on every tick.
