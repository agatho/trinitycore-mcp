  class: KitingManager
  method: FindEmergencyEscapeRoute
  signature: int KitingManager::FindEmergencyEscapeRoute(const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal escape route for a player when under threat.
  description: The FindEmergencyEscapeRoute method determines the best available path
    for a player to flee from an imminent threat situation. It evaluates the current
    environment, including terrain, obstacles, and enemy positions, to calculate a
    safe escape route. This method is typically used in AI-driven kiting behaviors
    where the player needs to maintain distance from enemies while avoiding harmful
    situations. The result represents a directional or positional indicator that guides
    the player's movement away from danger.
  parameters:
  - name: threats
    description: An integer value representing the number or severity level of active
      threats in the player's vicinity. Higher values may influence the urgency and
      path calculation for escape routing.
  returns: Returns an integer value that corresponds to a calculated escape route
    identifier or direction. A positive value typically indicates a valid escape path,
    while zero or negative values might represent no viable escape options or error
    conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindEmergencyEscapeRoute
    code: "int threatLevel = 5;\nint escapeRoute = kitingManager.FindEmergencyEscapeRoute(threatLevel);\n\
      if (escapeRoute > 0) {\n    // Move player along the calculated escape route\n\
      \    player->MoveTo(escapeRoute);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger kiting AI system and relies on environmental
    data being up-to-date. The implementation may use pathfinding algorithms internally
    to determine optimal routes, which could impact performance during high-threat
    scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the threat level parameter accurately reflects actual danger
    for proper route calculation. Incorrect threat values can lead to suboptimal or
    unsafe escape paths.
