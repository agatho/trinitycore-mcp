documentation:
  brief: Removes a GameObjectModel from the dynamic map tree collision system
  description: The remove method eliminates a GameObjectModel instance from the DynamicMapTree's
    internal spatial data structure, effectively removing it from collision detection.
    This operation is essential for maintaining accurate terrain and object interactions
    in the game world, particularly when objects are destroyed, moved, or removed
    from the map. The method ensures that the tree structure remains consistent with
    the current state of game objects and prevents stale collision data from affecting
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Reference to the GameObjectModel instance that should be removed
      from the dynamic map tree
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a destroyed game object from collision system
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = GetGameObjectModel();\nif (model)\n{\n    DynamicMapTree::getInstance().remove(*model);\n\
      \    delete model;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object cleanup or destruction phases.
    The implementation likely involves tree node removal and rebalancing operations
    to maintain optimal performance. It's important that the GameObjectModel reference
    remains valid until after this call, as internal references may be used during
    the removal process.
  warnings: Calling remove with an invalid or already-removed GameObjectModel reference
    can lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that the model was
    previously added to the tree before attempting removal.
