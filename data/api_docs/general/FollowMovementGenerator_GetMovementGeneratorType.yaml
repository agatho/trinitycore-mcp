documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for a follow movement generator
    instance.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique type identifier
    associated with the FollowMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used internally
    by the TrinityCore AI system to distinguish different types of movement generators
    and route behavior appropriately. The returned value typically corresponds to
    a predefined enum or constant that represents the 'follow' movement type within
    the game's movement system. This method is commonly called during AI decision-making
    processes to determine how a creature or unit should move in relation to its target.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for the
    FollowMovementGenerator. This value is typically a constant defined in the movement
    generator enumeration, such as MOVEMENTgenerator_TYPE_FOLLOW (value may vary based
    on core version).
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "FollowMovementGenerator* followGen = new FollowMovementGenerator(target);\n\
      int type = followGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\nif (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_FOLLOW)\n\
      {\n    // Handle follow movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure virtual function implementation in the base MovementGenerator
    class, and it's expected to return a constant value for each specific movement
    generator type. The exact integer value returned may vary between TrinityCore
    versions but will consistently identify the 'follow' movement behavior.
