documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the MongooseBiteTracker has any remaining charges available
    for use.
  description: The HasCharges method determines if the MongooseBiteTracker instance
    currently holds one or more usable charges. This is typically used in game mechanics
    where abilities or items have limited uses before requiring recharging or replenishment.
    The method performs a simple check on internal charge counters and returns true
    if at least one charge remains, false otherwise. It is commonly called before
    attempting to consume a charge to avoid invalid operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tracker has at least one charge remaining; otherwise
    returns false.

      \ remaining.\");\n}"
