  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: CalculateCombatPosition
  signature: int RoleBasedCombatPositioning::CalculateCombatPosition(Player * bot,
    const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat position for a bot player based
    on the provided combat context.
  description: The CalculateCombatPosition method determines the best positional strategy
    for a bot player during combat by analyzing various factors such as target distance,
    threat level, available cover, and combat role. This method is typically used
    in AI-driven bot behavior systems to ensure that bots maintain effective positioning
    for optimal damage output or tanking performance. The method evaluates the current
    combat context and returns an integer identifier representing the calculated position
    type or strategy. It requires a valid Player object and a populated CombatPositionContext
    structure to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the combat
      position is being calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a CombatPositionContext structure containing all relevant
      combat data including target information, threat levels, and environmental factors
      needed for positioning calculations.
  returns: 'An integer value representing the calculated combat position strategy.
    Possible return values may include: 0 for default positioning, positive integers
    for specific tactical positions (e.g., ranged, melee, flanking), or negative values
    indicating error conditions such as invalid context data or insufficient combat
    information.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateCombatPosition
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nCombatPositionContext\
      \ context;\ncontext.target = targetUnit;\ncontext.threatLevel = ThreatLevel::HIGH;\n\
      int position = RoleBasedCombatPositioning::CalculateCombatPosition(myBot, context);\n\
      if (position >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with the calculated position strategy\n\
      \    printf(\"Calculated position: %d\\n\", position);\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error condition\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate combat position\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger role-based combat system and assumes that
    the bot's class, level, and equipped gear are properly initialized. The CombatPositionContext
    should be updated regularly to reflect current combat conditions for accurate
    positioning decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer and CombatPositionContext are valid before
    calling this method. Passing null pointers or uninitialized context structures
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
