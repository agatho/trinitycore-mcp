  class: Group
  method: GetMemberSlots
  signature: const MemberSlotList & Group::GetMemberSlots() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a constant reference to the list of group member slots.
  description: The GetMemberSlots method provides access to the internal collection
    of member slots that represent all players currently in the group. Each slot contains
    information about a group member, including their GUID, name, and other relevant
    data. This method is commonly used for iterating through group members or checking
    group composition during gameplay events such as loot distribution, raid management,
    or player status updates. The returned reference is read-only, ensuring that modifications
    to the member list must be performed through dedicated group management functions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a MemberSlotList container which holds all active
    group members' slot information. Each slot typically contains player GUID, name,
    and status details.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Through Group Members
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    for (const auto&\
      \ slot : group->GetMemberSlots())\n    {\n        if (slot.guid)\n         \
      \   sLog->outString(\"Group member: {}\", slot.name);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Group Size
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    size_t memberCount\
      \ = group->GetMemberSlots().size();\n    sLog->outString(\"Group has {} members\"\
      , memberCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned MemberSlotList is managed internally by the Group class and
    should not be modified directly. Accessing this list during group operations (such
    as adding/removing members) may result in inconsistent data if the group state
    changes between calls.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned MemberSlotList directly, as
    it's a const reference to internal data. Modifications should be made through
    Group member management functions like AddMember or RemoveMember. Be cautious
    when iterating over this list while group membership is changing.
