  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ArenaMatchState class with default values.
  description: The ArenaMatchState constructor initializes a new arena match state
    object, setting up internal data structures and default parameters required for
    tracking arena match progress. This method is typically called when creating a
    new arena match instance within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization
    includes setting up player lists, score tracking, and match duration timers. It
    ensures that all necessary components are properly configured before the match
    begins.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ArenaMatchState instance
    code: 'ArenaMatchState* matchState = new ArenaMatchState();

      // The match state is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new arena match. It
    does not perform any validation of input parameters since it takes no parameters.
    The object should be properly managed with memory allocation/deallocation to prevent
    memory leaks.
