documentation:
  brief: Initializes the motion master for a creature or player, setting up movement
    behaviors and pathfinding.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the MotionMaster object for use by establishing
    default movement behavior and initializing internal state variables. This method
    is typically called during object creation or when a creature or player needs
    to begin movement operations. It sets up the necessary infrastructure for pathfinding,
    movement types, and destination handling. The method ensures that all movement-related
    components are properly configured before any actual movement occurs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->GetMotionMaster()->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during object initialization. Calling
    it multiple times may cause unexpected behavior or memory leaks. The method initializes
    internal movement state but does not start actual movement operations.
