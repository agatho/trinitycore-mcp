  signature: void ProtectionPaladinRefactored::TauntTarget(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Taunt ability to a target unit, forcing it to attack the paladin.
  description: The TauntTarget method implements the Protection Paladin's taunt ability,
    which forces a specified target to shift its threat and focus its attacks toward
    the paladin. This ability is crucial for controlling enemy aggro and protecting
    allies in combat. The method takes an integer pointer to a target unit, validates
    that the target is valid and within range, and then applies the taunt effect using
    core TrinityCore mechanics. It typically requires the paladin to be in melee range
    of the target and ensures that the taunt does not fail due to immunity or other
    restrictions. This method is commonly used in both PvE and PvP scenarios for managing
    threat distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      The value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID
      within the current map context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Taunt Usage
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      this->TauntTarget(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Taunt with Validation
    code: "if (target && target->IsInWorld()) {\n    int targetGuid = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    this->TauntTarget(&targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on core TrinityCore threat management systems. Ensure
    the target is valid and within melee range before calling to avoid errors or unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling TauntTarget with an invalid or null target pointer may result
    in undefined behavior or server-side crashes. Always validate the target before
    invoking this method.
