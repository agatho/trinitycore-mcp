documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from an arena team with specified team ID and update flags.
  description: The RemovePlayer method removes a specified player from an arena team
    within the TrinityCore framework. This function is typically invoked when a player
    leaves an arena match or is disqualified, ensuring proper cleanup of team membership
    and associated statistics. The method takes into account the team ID to identify
    which specific arena team the player belongs to, and uses update flags to determine
    what kind of updates should be performed (e.g., updating ratings, removing from
    roster). It's an integral part of maintaining accurate arena team data and player
    statistics in World of Warcraft-style PvP environments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Player object that needs to be removed from the arena
      team. This parameter must not be null.
  - name: param1
    description: Integer representing the arena team ID. This identifies which specific
      arena team the player belongs to and is used to locate the correct team data
      structure.
  - name: param2
    description: 32-bit unsigned integer containing update flags that control how
      the removal process should be handled. These flags may indicate whether to update
      player ratings, send notifications, or perform other related actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Removal from Arena Team
    code: "Arena* arena = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nPlayer* player\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayerByName(\"ExamplePlayer\");\nif (arena && player)\n\
      {\n    arena->RemovePlayer(player, 12345, ARENA_UPDATE_STATS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Player Removal with Multiple Update Flags
    code: "Arena* arena = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(67890);\nPlayer* player\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayerByName(\"AnotherPlayer\");\nif (arena && player)\n\
      {\n    uint32 flags = ARENA_UPDATE_STATS | ARENA_UPDATE_RATINGS | ARENA_SEND_NOTIFICATION;\n\
      \    arena->RemovePlayer(player, 67890, flags);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player is already registered in the specified
    arena team. It does not perform any validation on whether the player actually
    belongs to the team before attempting removal. The update flags parameter allows
    for flexible handling of different scenarios such as rating adjustments or notification
    sending.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid team ID or null player pointer can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the arena team exists and the
    player is properly initialized before invoking this function. Also, be cautious
    when using update flags - incorrect combinations may cause unexpected side effects
    in player statistics or notifications.
