  class: MaelstromWeaponTracker
  method: AddStack
  signature: void MaelstromWeaponTracker::AddStack(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a specified number of stacks to the Maelstrom weapon tracker.
  description: 'The AddStack method increases the stack count of a Maelstrom weapon
    effect by the provided amount. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft''s
    TrinityCore framework to manage combat effects such as those from the Maelstrom
    weapon enchantment. It modifies the internal state of the tracker without returning
    any value. The method likely interacts with player combat mechanics and may trigger
    visual or auditory feedback depending on the implementation. Precondition: The
    MaelstromWeaponTracker instance must be valid and initialized. Postcondition:
    The stack count is incremented by the specified amount.'
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of stacks to add to the tracker. Must be a non-negative
      integer value representing the quantity of stacks to increment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MaelstromWeaponTracker tracker;

      tracker.AddStack(1); // Adds one stack to the tracker'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Stacks
    code: "MaelstromWeaponTracker* tracker = player->GetMaelstromWeaponTracker();\n\
      if (tracker)\n{\n    tracker->AddStack(5); // Adds five stacks to the tracker\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters and may be called during combat
    events such as spell casts or melee hits. It is important that this method is
    thread-safe if used in concurrent environments, though typical TrinityCore usage
    patterns are single-threaded per player instance.
  warnings: Ensure the MaelstromWeaponTracker object is properly initialized before
    calling AddStack to avoid undefined behavior. Passing negative values for 'amount'
    could lead to unexpected results or underflow depending on implementation details.
