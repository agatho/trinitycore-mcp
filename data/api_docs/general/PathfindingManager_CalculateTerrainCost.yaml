  method: CalculateTerrainCost
  signature: float PathfindingManager::CalculateTerrainCost(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the terrain cost for a given position in the game world.
  description: The CalculateTerrainCost method computes a movement cost value associated
    with a specific position in the World of Warcraft game world. This cost is typically
    used by pathfinding algorithms to determine the most efficient route for units
    to navigate through terrain. The method evaluates various factors such as elevation
    changes, terrain type, and obstacles to assign a numerical cost that reflects
    how difficult it is to traverse that particular location. The returned value is
    usually normalized to a float between 0.0 (easiest to traverse) and higher values
    (more difficult or impassable). This method is integral to the TrinityCore's navigation
    system and is often called during pathfinding calculations to assess movement
    feasibility.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or index used to determine terrain cost.
      In the context of TrinityCore, this parameter likely represents a grid cell
      or node in the navigation mesh, typically encoded as an integer value that maps
      to specific coordinates in the game world.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated terrain cost for the specified
    position. Lower values indicate easier traversal while higher values suggest more
    difficult or impassable terrain. The exact scale and interpretation may vary based
    on internal implementation details but typically ranges from 0.0 (free movement)
    to several hundred or more for very difficult terrains.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pathfinding
    code: "float cost = pathfinder->CalculateTerrainCost(12345);\nif (cost < 10.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Terrain is relatively easy to traverse\n    // Proceed with pathfinding\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using terrain cost for movement decision
    code: "int position = GetUnitPositionIndex(unit);\nfloat terrainCost = pathfinder->CalculateTerrainCost(position);\n\
      if (terrainCost > 50.0f)\n{\n    // Avoid this path due to high terrain cost\n\
      \    unit->SetMovementBlocked(true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ movement\n    unit->SetMovementBlocked(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger navigation mesh system that pre-processes
    terrain data. The implementation may cache previously calculated costs for performance
    reasons. Developers should be aware that the cost values are not static and can
    change based on dynamic world conditions such as destructible terrain or temporary
    obstacles.
  warnings: The parameter 'pos' must represent a valid position within the current
    navigation mesh boundaries, otherwise the method may return unexpected results
    or cause undefined behavior. Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency
    pathfinding loops as repeated calculations can impact performance.
