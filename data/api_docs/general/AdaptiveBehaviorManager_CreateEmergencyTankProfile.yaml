  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: CreateEmergencyTankProfile
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::CreateEmergencyTankProfile()
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new emergency tank profile for adaptive behavior management.
  description: The CreateEmergencyTankProfile method initializes and sets up a specialized
    tank profile within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This profile is designed to handle
    critical situations where standard tanking behaviors are insufficient, such as
    during high-damage encounters or when the primary tank is incapacitated. The method
    likely configures specific threat management, cooldown handling, and positioning
    strategies tailored for emergency scenarios. It ensures that the AI system can
    quickly adapt to unexpected combat conditions by activating predefined emergency
    protocols.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->CreateEmergencyTankProfile();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the system is in a state where emergency
    tanking protocols are required. The profile created may override existing behavior
    settings temporarily until the emergency condition is resolved.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or validation may lead to unexpected
    behavior changes in AI-controlled units. Ensure that emergency profiles are properly
    cleaned up after use to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior.
