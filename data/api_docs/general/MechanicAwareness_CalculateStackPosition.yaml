  signature: int MechanicAwareness::CalculateStackPosition(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the stack position for a given mechanic group within the MechanicAwareness
    system
  description: The CalculateStackPosition method determines the appropriate stack
    position for a specified mechanic group, which is used internally by the MechanicAwareness
    class to manage and track different mechanic types and their stacking behaviors.
    This method likely evaluates the current state of mechanic stacks and returns
    a position value that indicates where a new mechanic should be placed or how it
    interacts with existing mechanics. The method operates on the mechanic group identifier
    passed as a parameter and returns an integer representing the calculated stack
    position, which may be used for priority ordering, stacking limits, or conflict
    resolution within the game's mechanic system.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The mechanic group identifier to calculate stack position for. This
      represents a specific category or type of mechanic within the game system, typically
      defined by constants or enumerations related to game mechanics such as stun,
      root, silence, etc.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated stack position for the specified
    mechanic group. The value typically indicates where in a stack or priority list
    the mechanic should be placed, with negative values possibly indicating invalid
    or unstackable mechanics, and positive values indicating valid stack positions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine stack position
    code: 'int position = awareness.CalculateStackPosition(MECHANIC_STUN);

      // Returns the stack position for the stun mechanic group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using calculated stack position in mechanic handling
    code: "int group = MECHANIC_ROOT;\nint stackPos = awareness.CalculateStackPosition(group);\n\
      if (stackPos >= 0)\n{\n    // Process stacking logic for root mechanic\n   \
      \ HandleMechanicStacking(group, stackPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages game mechanics
    and their interactions. The exact algorithm for calculating stack positions may
    depend on internal state tracking, stacking rules, or priority systems within
    the MechanicAwareness class. Developers should be aware that this method might
    be called frequently during combat events and should consider performance implications.
  warnings: The method signature shows a const reference parameter which suggests
    it's designed to be read-only and shouldn't modify the input group value. However,
    since the actual implementation isn't provided, developers should verify that
    the method behaves as expected with various mechanic group values.
