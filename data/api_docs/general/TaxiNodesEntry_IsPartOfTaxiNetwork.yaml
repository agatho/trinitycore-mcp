documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the taxi node is part of the active taxi network in the
    game world.
  description: The IsPartOfTaxiNetwork method checks if a given taxi node is currently
    enabled and accessible within the game's taxi system. This flag indicates whether
    players can use this node for flight path travel. The method evaluates internal
    state flags or data members that define the node's availability in the taxi network,
    which may be affected by game events, player progress, or server configuration.
    It is commonly used during flight path validation and UI display logic to determine
    if a destination node should be selectable by players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the taxi node is part of the active taxi network and can
    be used for travel; otherwise returns false if the node is disabled, unlinked,
    or not yet unlocked for the player's current game state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a taxi node is accessible before initiating flight
    code: "if (taxiNode->IsPartOfTaxiNetwork()) {\n    // Proceed with flight path\
      \ logic\n    Player->AddTaxiPath(taxiNode);\n} else {\n    // Notify player\
      \ that the node is not yet available\n    SendSystemMessage(\"This flight path\
      \ is currently unavailable.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal flags or database state to determine
    network participation. It may be called frequently during player movement and
    UI updates, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
