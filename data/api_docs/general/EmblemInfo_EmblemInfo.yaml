  brief: Initializes a new EmblemInfo object with default values
  description: The EmblemInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the EmblemInfo
    class, setting up default values for all member variables. This method is typically
    called when creating a new emblem configuration object, such as when processing
    guild emblems or player faction symbols. The constructor ensures that all internal
    data members are properly initialized to their default states, preventing undefined
    behavior when accessing emblem properties. This initialization routine is crucial
    for maintaining data integrity in the game's emblem system and should be invoked
    before any other operations on the emblem object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic EmblemInfo Construction
    code: 'EmblemInfo emblem;

      // Creates a new emblem with default values

      // All member variables are initialized to their defaults'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating EmblemInfo in Guild Context
    code: "class Guild\n{\npublic:\n    EmblemInfo guildEmblem;\n    \n    Guild()\n\
      \    {\n        // Constructor calls EmblemInfo() constructor\n        // to\
      \ initialize the emblem with default values\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a default constructor, meaning it has no parameters. The constructor
    performs basic initialization of all member variables to their default states.
    In TrinityCore's architecture, this constructor is typically called automatically
    when creating new EmblemInfo objects on the stack or when using default object
    creation patterns.
