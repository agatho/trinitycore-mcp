  brief: Checks whether the bot has active quest objectives in the current quest log
  description: The HasActiveObjectives method determines if the bot currently has
    any active quest objectives that are not yet completed. This method evaluates
    the bot's active quests and their progress, returning true if at least one objective
    is still in progress or pending completion. The check considers all active quests
    in the bot's quest log and examines whether any of their objectives remain unfulfilled.
    This functionality is typically used by AI systems to determine when a bot should
    continue performing quest-related actions or when it should move on to other activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot has at least one active quest objective that is
    not yet completed, false otherwise. The method returns false when all active quests
    have been completed or when there are no active quests in the bot's quest log.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for active objectives
    code: "if (strategy->HasActiveObjectives(ai)) {\n    // Bot has active quest objectives\n\
      \    ai->DoNextAction();\n} else {\n    // No active objectives, bot can perform\
      \ other actions\n    ai->SetState(BotState::IDLE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making loop
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    if (questStrategy->HasActiveObjectives(this))\
      \ {\n        // Continue with quest objectives\n        ProcessQuestObjectives();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // No active quests, consider new quest assignment\n\
      \        AssignNewQuest();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's current quest log state and may not reflect
    objectives that are pending but not yet added to the log. The implementation likely
    checks both quest completion status and objective fulfillment states. Performance
    is generally low as it involves iterating through active quests and checking their
    individual progress.
  warnings: The method may return false even when a bot has recently completed a quest
    but hasn't had time to update its quest log yet. This can cause temporary inconsistencies
    in AI behavior. Ensure that the BotAI parameter is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method.
