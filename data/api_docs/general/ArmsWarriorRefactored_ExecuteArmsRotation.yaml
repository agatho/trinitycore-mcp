  method: ExecuteArmsRotation
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::ExecuteArmsRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Arms Warrior's rotation logic against a specified target.
  description: The ExecuteArmsRotation method implements the core combat behavior
    for an Arms Warrior AI, determining and executing the appropriate sequence of
    abilities based on current game state and target conditions. This method typically
    evaluates factors such as rage availability, weapon uptime, buff/debuff status,
    and threat level to select the most optimal ability from the Arms Warrior's spell
    list. It is designed to be called during the AI update cycle and manages the warrior's
    resource allocation and ability usage in a manner consistent with optimal Arms
    rotation theorycrafting.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      Must not be null or invalid, as the method will assert or fail if no valid target
      is provided.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ArmsWarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    ExecuteArmsRotation(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with target validation
    code: "void ArmsWarriorAI::DoCombatAction()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        if (target->IsAlive())\n            ExecuteArmsRotation(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has already determined a valid target via
    other means, such as through the AI's internal target selection logic. It does
    not perform any target validation or threat management itself. The implementation
    may vary between different versions of TrinityCore and should be tested with the
    specific build being used.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target parameter is always checked for validity before
    calling this method. Additionally, this method modifies the AI's internal state
    and may affect resource tracking (e.g., rage, combo points), so it should not
    be called during critical sections where such state changes could cause race conditions.
