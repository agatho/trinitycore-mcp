  method: CheckHealingLineOfSight
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CheckHealingLineOfSight(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a healing line of sight exists between the unit and the target.
  description: The CheckHealingLineOfSight method determines whether a valid healing
    line of sight exists from the calling unit to the specified target. This is used
    in game mechanics to ensure that healing spells or abilities can be properly cast
    without obstructions. The method evaluates the spatial relationship between the
    unit and its target, considering environmental obstacles such as walls, terrain,
    and other solid objects that might block the healing line of sight. It returns
    true if a clear path exists for healing spells to reach the target, and false
    otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid healing line of sight exists from the unit to the
    target, allowing healing spells to be cast successfully; returns false if an obstruction
    blocks the line of sight.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Line of Sight Check
    code: "if (unit->GetLineOfSightManager()->CheckHealingLineOfSight(target)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with healing spell\n    unit->CastSpell(target, HEALING_SPELL_ID);\n\
      } else {\n    // Cannot heal due to obstruction\n    unit->SendSpellFailed(HEALING_SPELL_ID,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NO_LINE_OF_SIGHT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell casting validation to ensure that
    healing abilities can reach their intended targets. It performs a raycast check
    from the unit's position towards the target's position, taking into account all
    relevant environmental and object-based obstructions.
