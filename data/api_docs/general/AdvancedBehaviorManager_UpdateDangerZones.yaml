  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::UpdateDangerZones(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state and positioning of danger zones within the advanced behavior
    manager.
  description: The UpdateDangerZones method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the status of all active danger zones in the AI behavior system. It processes
    time-based changes, checks for zone expiration or activation conditions, and ensures
    that the current state of danger zones accurately reflects their real-time relevance
    within the game world. This method typically runs during each AI update cycle
    to keep dynamic threat areas like explosive traps, hazardous environments, or
    enemy-controlled zones up-to-date. The implementation may involve checking for
    player proximity, updating timers, and triggering relevant events when danger
    zone states change.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_behaviorManager->UpdateDangerZones(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly as part of the AI update loop,
    typically every tick or at fixed intervals. It's performance-critical since it
    may iterate through multiple active danger zones and perform time-sensitive checks.
    The implementation likely uses internal timers and state tracking to avoid redundant
    updates.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called outside of a valid AI update context,
    as it may rely on time-based state changes and player proximity checks that are
    only meaningful within the game loop. Avoid calling it in parallel threads without
    proper synchronization.
