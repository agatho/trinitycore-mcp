  class: HealInfo
  method: GetHeal
  signature: uint32 HealInfo::GetHeal() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the amount of healing done by this HealInfo object.
  description: The GetHeal method retrieves the total healing value that was applied
    as part of a healing event. This value represents the actual amount of health
    restored to the target, accounting for any modifiers such as critical strikes,
    overhealing, or absorption effects. The returned value is typically used in combat
    logging, damage meters, and other systems that track healing performance. This
    method does not perform any calculations or modifications; it simply returns the
    precomputed healing amount stored within the HealInfo object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total healing amount applied to the target.
    This value is always non-negative and reflects the effective healing done, after
    accounting for game mechanics like overhealing caps or absorption effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Healing Event
    code: "void HandleHealEvent(Unit* healer, Unit* target, SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\
      \ {\n    HealInfo healInfo(healer, target, spellInfo, 1000);\n    uint32 actualHeal\
      \ = healInfo.GetHeal();\n    // Use actualHeal for logging or performance tracking\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetHeal in Combat Log
    code: "void LogHealingEvent(HealInfo const& healInfo) {\n    uint32 healAmount\
      \ = healInfo.GetHeal();\n    if (healAmount > 0) {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player healed for %u points.\", healAmount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The HealInfo class is designed to encapsulate all relevant data about a healing
    event, including the base heal amount, critical hit status, and final healed value.
    This method specifically returns the final computed healing amount that was applied
    to the target, which may differ from the initial spell's base healing value due
    to game mechanics.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns only the effective healing amount after
    all modifiers have been applied. If you need access to the raw heal amount before
    modifications, you should use a different method or member variable within HealInfo.
    Also, in cases where overhealing occurs, this value will reflect the actual amount
    restored to the target's health pool, not the total heal that would have been
    applied.
