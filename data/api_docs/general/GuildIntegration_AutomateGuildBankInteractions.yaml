api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: AutomateGuildBankInteractions
  signature: void GuildIntegration::AutomateGuildBankInteractions(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Automates guild bank interactions for a specified player, handling item deposits,
    withdrawals, and management tasks.
  description: The AutomateGuildBankInteractions method is responsible for managing
    automated guild bank operations for a given player. This function typically handles
    tasks such as automatic item deposits from player inventories, withdrawal of items
    for guild members, and maintenance of guild bank logs or records. The method operates
    within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, ensuring that
    guild banking activities are processed according to server rules and permissions.
    It may also handle synchronization between the player's inventory and the guild
    bank, including updating item counts, managing cooldowns, and enforcing guild
    bank access restrictions based on member ranks.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the game world. This parameter identifies which specific player's
      guild bank interactions will be automated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.AutomateGuildBankInteractions(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Event Handling
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.AutomateGuildBankInteractions(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during appropriate game events or when a player
    logs in to ensure that their guild bank interactions are properly initialized.
    The implementation may involve database operations and synchronization with the
    server's internal guild banking system, so performance considerations should be
    taken into account for high-traffic servers.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the game world. Passing an invalid or uninitialized pointer could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes within the TrinityCore framework.
