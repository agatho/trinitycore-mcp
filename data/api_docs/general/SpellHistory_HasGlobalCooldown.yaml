  signature: bool SpellHistory::HasGlobalCooldown(const SpellInfo * spellInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell has an active global cooldown.
  description: Determines whether the specified spell is currently under a global
    cooldown effect. Global cooldowns are applied to all spells and abilities that
    are subject to this restriction, typically lasting for 1.5 seconds after casting
    any spell or ability that triggers a global cooldown. This method evaluates the
    internal state of the SpellHistory class to determine if the cooldown period for
    the given spell is still active. The check considers both the spell's own cooldown
    properties and the global cooldown timer that may be active on the caster.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is currently under a global cooldown, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the spell can be cast at the current time based on global
    cooldown restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell readiness
    code: "if (!player->GetSpellHistory()->HasGlobalCooldown(spellInfo)) {\n    //\
      \ Spell can be cast\n    player->CastSpell(target, spellId, true);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Spell is on global cooldown\n    SendCastResult(spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal global cooldown tracking mechanism within
    SpellHistory. It does not directly check spell-specific cooldowns but rather evaluates
    the global cooldown state that affects all applicable spells. The global cooldown
    timer is typically managed by the player's casting system and is reset when a
    new global cooldown begins.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks for global cooldown status, not
    individual spell cooldowns. Spells may still be unavailable due to other cooldowns
    even if they pass this check. Also, the global cooldown state can change rapidly
    during combat, so calling this method in time-sensitive contexts should consider
    potential race conditions.
