  method: MonitorEventProgress
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::MonitorEventProgress(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors and updates the progress of a specified guild event.
  description: The MonitorEventProgress method is responsible for tracking and managing
    the current state and progression of a guild event identified by its unique event
    ID. This method likely checks the event's status, updates any relevant timers
    or conditions, and ensures that the event progresses according to its defined
    rules. It may also trigger notifications or rewards when certain milestones are
    reached. The method is typically invoked periodically or in response to player
    actions within the guild context.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier for the guild event to be monitored. This value
      must correspond to a valid event registered with the GuildEventCoordinator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Monitoring
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.MonitorEventProgress(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Multiple Events
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\nstd::vector<uint32> eventIds = {1001,\
      \ 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : eventIds) {\n    coordinator.MonitorEventProgress(id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to ensure timely updates of guild
    events. It is likely part of a larger event management system and may interact
    with other components such as timers, player data, or database entries.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter corresponds to an active and valid guild
    event; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Calling this method on non-existent
    events might lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
