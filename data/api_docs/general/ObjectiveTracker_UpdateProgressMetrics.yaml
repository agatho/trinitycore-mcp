  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateProgressMetrics(Player * bot, const QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Updates progress metrics for a quest objective tracked by the bot player
  description: The UpdateProgressMetrics method is responsible for updating the tracking
    information associated with a specific quest objective. This method is typically
    invoked when a player's actions affect the progress of a tracked quest, such as
    killing mobs, collecting items, or completing objectives. It ensures that the
    ObjectiveTracker reflects the current state of the quest progress for the specified
    bot player. The method processes the provided QuestObjectiveData to determine
    how the progress should be updated within the tracker system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest progress
      is being updated. Must not be null.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific quest objective that has progressed. This includes details
      such as objective type, progress count, and target requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UpdateProgressMetrics
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      QuestObjectiveData objective;

      objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL;

      objective.requiredCount = 10;

      objective.currentCount = 5;

      objective.questId = 12345;

      objective.objectiveIndex = 0;

      objective.targetEntry = 1234;


      bot->GetObjectiveTracker()->UpdateProgressMetrics(bot, objective);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest tracking system and should only
    be called when actual progress changes occur. It's typically invoked by game logic
    that detects player actions related to quest objectives.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is a valid Player object before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The
    objective data must accurately reflect the current state of the quest objective
    being tracked.
