documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the member joined event handler
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves the unique string identifier associated
    with the MemberJoinedHandler class. This identifier is used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to register and dispatch chat channel events related to
    players joining guilds or groups. The returned string typically represents the
    handler's purpose and is utilized for debugging, logging, and event routing within
    the game's messaging system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of the MemberJoinedHandler
    instance, which is used for event registration and identification purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MemberJoinedHandler handler;

      std::string handlerName = handler.GetHandlerName();

      // Returns something like "MemberJoinedHandler"

      printf("Handler name: %s\n", handlerName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during event system initialization to register
    the handler with the appropriate message dispatcher. The returned string should
    be consistent across all instances of the same handler type and is often used
    in conjunction with other handler methods for event management.
