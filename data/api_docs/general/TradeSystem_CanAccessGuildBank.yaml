  signature: bool TradeSystem::CanAccessGuildBank(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has permission to access the guild bank.
  description: The CanAccessGuildBank method checks if a given player character has
    the necessary permissions to access the guild bank functionality. This typically
    involves verifying that the player is a member of a guild and has the appropriate
    rank or role within that guild. The method may also consider additional factors
    such as whether the guild bank is currently enabled, the player's online status,
    or specific guild permissions granted by the guild leader. This check is essential
    for maintaining game balance and ensuring only authorized players can interact
    with guild resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has permission to access the guild bank, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when the player is not in a guild, lacks sufficient
    guild permissions, or when guild bank access is disabled for the player's current
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check guild bank access
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is obtained\nif (TradeSystem::CanAccessGuildBank(player))\
      \ {\n    // Player can access guild bank\n    player->SendPacket(guildBankPacket);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player cannot access guild bank\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not have permission to access the guild bank.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs multiple checks internally including guild membership
    verification, rank validation, and possibly server-side configuration flags. It
    should be called before any guild bank operations to prevent unauthorized access.
  warnings: Do not assume that a player with access to the guild bank can perform
    all actions within it. Additional checks may be required for specific operations
    like withdrawing items or modifying guild bank settings.
