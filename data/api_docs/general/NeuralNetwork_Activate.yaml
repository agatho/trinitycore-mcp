  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: Activate
  signature: float NeuralNetwork::Activate(float x, ActivationFunction func) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies the specified activation function to the input value and returns
    the transformed result.
  description: The Activate method is a core component of the NeuralNetwork class
    that applies a given activation function to an input float value. This method
    serves as the primary mechanism for introducing non-linearity into the neural
    network's computations, which is essential for learning complex patterns. The
    method takes a single floating-point input and transforms it according to the
    specified activation function type. In the context of TrinityCore's AI systems,
    this method would typically be used during forward propagation through the network
    layers to compute neuron outputs. The method is marked as const, indicating that
    it does not modify the internal state of the NeuralNetwork object.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The input floating-point value to be transformed by the activation
      function
  - name: func
    description: The activation function to apply to the input value. This parameter
      determines how the input is transformed, with common options including sigmoid,
      tanh, ReLU, and others
  returns: 'Returns a float value representing the result of applying the specified
    activation function to the input x. The output range depends on the chosen activation
    function: sigmoid outputs values between 0 and 1, tanh outputs values between
    -1 and 1, while ReLU outputs values >= 0'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Activation Function Application
    code: 'NeuralNetwork network;

      float input = 0.5f;

      float result = network.Activate(input, ActivationFunction::SIGMOID);

      // Returns approximately 0.6225

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Different Activation Functions
    code: 'NeuralNetwork network;

      float input = -1.0f;

      float sigmoid_result = network.Activate(input, ActivationFunction::SIGMOID);

      float relu_result = network.Activate(input, ActivationFunction::RELU);

      float tanh_result = network.Activate(input, ActivationFunction::TANH);

      // Sigmoid: ~0.269, ReLU: 0.0, Tanh: -0.7619

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be thread-safe as it only reads from the network's
    configuration and performs mathematical operations without modifying internal
    state. The implementation likely uses optimized mathematical functions for activation
    calculations, which may vary depending on the specific activation function type.
    For performance-critical AI systems in TrinityCore, consider pre-computing activation
    function tables or using lookup methods for frequently used values.
  warnings: Ensure that the ActivationFunction enum values are properly defined and
    supported by the implementation. Using an unsupported or invalid activation function
    type may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect computations. The method assumes
    valid float inputs; extremely large or small floating-point values might cause
    numerical instability depending on the specific activation function used.
