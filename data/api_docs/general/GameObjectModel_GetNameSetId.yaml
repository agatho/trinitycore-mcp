documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name set identifier associated with this game object model.
  description: The GetNameSetId method returns a unique uint8 identifier that corresponds
    to a predefined set of names defined in the game's data files. This identifier
    is used internally by the TrinityCore server to determine which collection of
    possible names should be assigned to instances of this game object type. The name
    set ID is typically loaded from the GameObjectDisplayInfo.dbc file or similar
    database tables during server initialization and is crucial for proper localization
    and naming conventions in the game world. This method does not perform any dynamic
    computation; it simply returns a cached value that was set during object construction
    or loading.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the name set identifier associated with this
    GameObjectModel instance. This ID maps to a predefined list of names in the game's
    internal data structures, allowing for consistent naming across all instances
    of the same GameObject type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObjectModel* model = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      uint8 nameSetId = model->GetNameSetId();

      printf("Name set ID for this object: %u\n", nameSetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Name Set
    code: "GameObjectModel* model = ...;\nuint8 id = model->GetNameSetId();\nif (id\
      \ == 12)\n{\n    // Handle special case for name set 12\n    // e.g., assign\
      \ custom localized names\n}\nelse if (id >= 50 && id <= 60)\n{\n    // Apply\
      \ standard naming rules for this range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during object instantiation or when the server
    needs to determine how to name a specific game object instance. The returned value
    is immutable after construction and should not be modified externally. Performance-wise,
    this is a very fast operation as it's just returning a cached member variable.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObjectModel instance has been properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized object may result in
    undefined behavior. Also note that name set IDs are server-specific and may not
    be consistent across different game versions or patches.
