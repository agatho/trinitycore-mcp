api:
  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified resource for a Demon Hunter AI, typically used to manage
    fury or pain costs for abilities.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for deducting the required
    resource cost from a Demon Hunter's resource pool when an ability is cast. This
    method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when processing spell
    casts to ensure proper resource management. The method likely interacts with the
    Demon Hunter's current resource state, such as fury or pain, and reduces it according
    to the specified spell's cost requirements. It plays a critical role in maintaining
    game balance and ensuring that abilities can only be used when sufficient resources
    are available.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which resources should be
      consumed. This ID corresponds to a specific ability in the Demon Hunter's spellbook
      and determines how much resource (fury or pain) will be deducted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consuming Fury for Eye Beam
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if\
      \ (spellInfo->Id == 198013) // Eye Beam\n    {\n        ConsumeResource(198013);\n\
      \        // Proceed with ability execution\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management in Combat
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_FURY) >= 10)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Cast a fury-consuming spell\n        ConsumeResource(204021); // Fel Rush\n\
      \        me->CastSpell(me, 204021, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal AI logic and may not be directly
    called by external code. It's important to understand that resource consumption
    should only occur after verifying that the spell can be cast and that sufficient
    resources are available. The method may also trigger additional events or updates
    related to resource state changes.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method without checking for sufficient resources
    may lead to negative gameplay experiences or game logic errors. Always validate
    that the spell can be cast before calling this method.
