  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetMovementSpeed
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::GetMovementSpeed(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the movement speed of a bot player following a leader
    in the LeaderFollowBehavior AI system.
  description: The GetMovementSpeed method determines the appropriate movement speed
    for a bot player that is following a leader within the LeaderFollowBehavior AI
    framework. This method evaluates various factors such as the bot's current state,
    distance from the leader, and any applicable movement modifiers to compute a normalized
    speed value. The returned speed is typically used by the AI system to control
    how fast the bot moves while maintaining formation with its leader. The method
    assumes that the bot player is valid and properly initialized within the context
    of the behavior system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is following
      the leader. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player
      instance within the AI system.
  returns: A float value representing the movement speed of the bot player. The value
    typically ranges from 0.0f (stationary) to 1.0f (maximum speed), though actual
    values may vary based on game mechanics and modifiers applied by the AI behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float speed = leaderFollowBehavior->GetMovementSpeed(playerBot);\nif (speed\
      \ > 0.5f) {\n    // Bot is moving at above-average speed\n    playerBot->SetWalk(false);\n\
      } else {\n    // Bot is moving slowly or stationary\n    playerBot->SetWalk(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using movement speed to adjust pathfinding
    code: "float currentSpeed = leaderFollowBehavior->GetMovementSpeed(playerBot);\n\
      playerBot->UpdateSpeed(MOVE_RUN, currentSpeed);\n// Adjusts the bot's actual\
      \ movement speed based on AI-calculated value\nif (playerBot->GetDistance(leader)\
      \ > 10.0f) {\n    playerBot->SetWalk(false); // Run if far from leader\n} else\
      \ {\n    playerBot->SetWalk(true);  // Walk if close to leader\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and may be influenced
    by external factors such as terrain, combat state, or player buffs/debuffs. The
    implementation likely considers the bot's current movement state, target distance,
    and any speed modifiers applied by the behavior system.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and initialized before
    calling this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior.
    The returned speed value should be used carefully in movement calculations to
    avoid erratic behavior or performance issues.
