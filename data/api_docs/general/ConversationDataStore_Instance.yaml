documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ConversationDataStore class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the ConversationDataStore
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the data store exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global conversation-related
    data and configuration. The returned pointer should be used directly without attempting
    to delete or manage its lifetime, as it is managed internally by the singleton
    implementation. This approach allows for centralized management of conversation
    data across different subsystems of the TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single ConversationDataStore instance. The method never
    returns NULL as the singleton ensures instantiation on first access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Conversation Data Store
    code: 'ConversationDataStore* store = ConversationDataStore::Instance();

      // Use the store to access conversation data

      uint32 conversationId = store->GetConversationForNpc(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses a thread-safe singleton implementation pattern. The instance
    is created on first call and persists for the lifetime of the application. Developers
    should not attempt to instantiate or destroy ConversationDataStore objects manually.
  warnings: Do not delete or manage the returned pointer's memory as it is managed
    by the singleton. Avoid calling this method during static initialization phases
    where the singleton might not be fully constructed yet.
