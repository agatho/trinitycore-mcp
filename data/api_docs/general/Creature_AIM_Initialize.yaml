documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI for a creature with the provided CreatureAI instance
  description: The AIM_Initialize method sets up and initializes the AI behavior for
    a Creature object using the specified CreatureAI instance. This method is typically
    called during creature creation or when assigning a new AI type to an existing
    creature. It ensures that the AI system is properly configured and ready to handle
    AI-related operations such as pathfinding, combat behavior, and scripted actions.
    The method performs necessary setup operations including initializing internal
    AI state variables, linking the AI instance to the creature's context, and preparing
    the AI for execution. This initialization process is crucial for proper AI functionality
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the CreatureAI instance that will be assigned to control
      this creature's behavior. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the AI initialization was successful, false otherwise.
    Initialization may fail if the AI instance is invalid or if there are system resource
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nCreatureAI* ai = new GenericAI(creature);\n\
      bool success = creature->AIM_Initialize(ai);\nif (success)\n{\n    // AI is\
      \ now initialized and ready\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Initialization with Error Handling
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nCreatureAI* ai = ...; // Assume this is properly\
      \ created\nif (ai != nullptr)\n{\n    bool result = creature->AIM_Initialize(ai);\n\
      \    if (!result)\n    {\n        // Handle initialization failure\n       \
      \ sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize AI for creature %u\", creature->GetEntry());\n\
      \    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid AI instance provided for creature\
      \ %u\", creature->GetEntry());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per creature during its lifecycle,
    typically during the creature's construction or when switching AI types. The method
    assumes that the CreatureAI instance passed in is properly constructed and compatible
    with the creature type. It's important to note that after calling this method,
    the AI system becomes active and will start receiving AI events and updates from
    the game loop.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same creature may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. Always ensure that the CreatureAI instance passed is
    valid and properly initialized before calling this method. Never pass a null pointer
    as the ai parameter, as this will likely cause a crash or assertion failure in
    debug builds.
