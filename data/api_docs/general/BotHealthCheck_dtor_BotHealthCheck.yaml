documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotHealthCheck instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotHealthCheck class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method ensures that health checking
    mechanisms for AI-controlled bots are properly terminated without leaving dangling
    references or memory leaks. This typically involves releasing internal data structures,
    canceling ongoing health checks, and ensuring proper cleanup of any associated
    thread or timer resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotHealthCheck instance
    code: 'BotHealthCheck* checker = new BotHealthCheck();

      // ... use checker ...

      delete checker; // Triggers ~BotHealthCheck()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when a BotHealthCheck object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other
    threads are actively using the instance when deletion occurs to prevent race conditions.
