documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the SocialMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the SocialMgr
    class, providing global access to the social system manager. This manager handles
    player social interactions such as friend lists, ignore lists, and group invitations.
    The method ensures that only one instance of SocialMgr exists throughout the application
    lifecycle, making it thread-safe for concurrent access. It is commonly used by
    other subsystems that need to interact with the social functionality of players
    within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of the SocialMgr class. The method
    never returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server
    startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Social Manager for Friend List Operations
    code: 'SocialMgr* socialMgr = SocialMgr::instance();

      Player* player = ...; // Get a player reference

      socialMgr->AddFriend(player, "TargetPlayer");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Social Manager in Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    SocialMgr* socialMgr = SocialMgr::instance();\n\
      \    // Initialize player's social data\n    socialMgr->LoadSocialList(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The SocialMgr
    instance is created during server initialization and destroyed at shutdown. Developers
    should not attempt to manually create or destroy instances of this class as it's
    managed entirely by the singleton mechanism.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, calling instance() multiple times will always
    return the same memory address. Be cautious when storing references to the returned
    pointer for extended periods, as the underlying object may be destroyed during
    server shutdown.
