    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total priority value for a specified level bracket
    in the bot distribution system.
  description: The CalculateTotalPriority method computes the cumulative priority
    score associated with a given level bracket within the BotLevelDistribution system.
    This value represents how heavily a particular level range is weighted when distributing
    bots across different player levels. The method takes a reference to an integer
    representing the level bracket and returns a floating-point number that reflects
    the total priority for that bracket. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    balanced bot distribution in World of Warcraft environments, particularly within
    TrinityCore's AI systems. The calculation likely considers factors such as player
    population density across levels, difficulty scaling, and game balance requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: brackets
    description: An integer reference representing the level bracket for which to
      calculate total priority. This value typically corresponds to a specific range
      of player levels (e.g., 1-10, 11-20). Valid values are determined by the internal
      configuration of the BotLevelDistribution system.
  returns: A float value representing the total calculated priority for the specified
    level bracket. Higher values indicate a greater weight or importance assigned
    to that bracket in bot distribution decisions. The return value may be zero or
    negative if no priority is assigned or if the bracket is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution distribution;

      int levelBracket = 5;

      float totalPriority = distribution.CalculateTotalPriority(levelBracket);

      std::cout << "Total priority for bracket " << levelBracket << ": " << totalPriority
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterative Priority Calculation
    code: "BotLevelDistribution distribution;\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {\n \
      \   float priority = distribution.CalculateTotalPriority(i);\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bracket \" << i << \" priority: \" << priority << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the bot management system to determine
    where and how many bots should be spawned based on player level distribution.
    The implementation may cache results for performance optimization, especially
    in high-frequency scenarios. Developers should ensure that the bracket parameter
    corresponds to valid ranges defined within the system's configuration.
  warnings: Passing an invalid bracket value (outside of configured ranges) might
    lead to unexpected behavior or return values. Ensure that all bracket references
    are validated before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior in production
    environments.
