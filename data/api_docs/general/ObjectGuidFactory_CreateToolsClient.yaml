  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateToolsClient
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateToolsClient(uint16 mapId, uint32
    serverId, uint64 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for a tools client entity on the specified map
    and server.
  description: The CreateToolsClient method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    designed for tools clients within the TrinityCore framework. This GUID is constructed
    using the provided map identifier, server identifier, and counter value to ensure
    global uniqueness across the game world. The generated GUID follows the standard
    World of Warcraft object GUID format, with the client type flag set appropriately
    to distinguish it from other object types such as players, creatures, or game
    objects. This method is typically used during initialization or spawning of tool-related
    entities in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The map identifier where the tools client will be located. Valid
      values are typically between 0 and 1000, representing different zones or instances
      in the game world.
  - name: serverId
    description: The server identifier that uniquely identifies this particular server
      instance within the cluster. This value helps ensure GUID uniqueness across
      multiple server instances.
  - name: counter
    description: A monotonically increasing counter value used to generate unique
      identifiers. This value should be incremented for each new tools client created
      to prevent GUID collisions.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object representing the unique identifier for the
    tools client entity. The returned GUID follows the standard World of Warcraft
    GUID format with appropriate type flags set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateToolsClient(1234, 5678, 1);

      // Creates a tools client GUID for map 1234, server 5678 with counter 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in entity creation context
    code: 'uint32 serverId = sWorld->GetServerId();

      uint16 mapId = player->GetMapId();

      ObjectGuid toolsGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateToolsClient(mapId, serverId,
      sObjectMgr->GenerateToolsClientCounter());

      // Used when spawning a new tools client entity in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ObjectGuidFactory is properly initialized and
    that the provided parameters are valid. The counter value should be managed carefully
    to avoid collisions, typically through atomic operations or database-based incrementing.
    The returned GUID will have the client type flag set appropriately for tools clients.
  warnings: Ensure that the serverId parameter accurately reflects the current server
    instance to prevent GUID conflicts across multiple servers. The counter must be
    incremented properly to maintain uniqueness; otherwise, duplicate GUIDs may be
    generated. This method should not be called with invalid map IDs or server IDs
    as it could lead to unexpected behavior.
