documentation:
  brief: Handles player entry into a scenario instance
  description: The OnPlayerEnter method is invoked when a player successfully enters
    a scenario instance. This method is typically called during the scenario initialization
    process and allows for custom handling of player-specific logic upon entry. The
    method receives a pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier and
    can be used to perform actions such as setting up initial conditions, applying
    buffs or debuffs, or triggering quest events specific to the scenario. This method
    is part of the scenario system's event handling mechanism in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the scenario instance
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Entry Handling
    code: "void Scenario::OnPlayerEnter(int* player)\n{\n    // Apply initial buffs\
      \ to the player\n    if (Player* plr = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(*player)))\n\
      \    {\n        plr->AddAura(12345, plr); // Example aura\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the scenario's initialization phase when players
    enter the instance. Developers should ensure that any player-specific modifications
    are thread-safe and do not interfere with the core scenario logic. The player
    pointer should be validated before dereferencing to prevent null pointer exceptions.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy operations or blocking calls within this method as
    it may affect scenario loading performance. Avoid modifying the scenario state
    directly from this method without proper synchronization mechanisms.
