  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void GroupFormation::UpdateMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates group formation metrics including player positions, distances, and
    alignment for optimal group coordination.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method calculates and refreshes key formation data
    for a group of players in World of Warcraft. This includes computing distances
    between group members, determining relative positions, and updating alignment
    metrics to maintain proper group spacing and positioning. The method is typically
    invoked during group movement, combat situations, or when formation changes occur.
    It ensures that group members maintain appropriate distances and orientations
    for effective gameplay mechanics such as spell targeting, tanking, and coordinated
    attacks. The updated metrics are used by the game engine to enforce formation
    rules and provide visual feedback to players about their group's positioning.

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "void HandleGroupFormationUpdate()\n{\n    GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\n\
      \    if (formation)\n    {\n        formation->UpdateMetrics();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is performance-critical and should only be called when necessary
    to avoid excessive CPU usage. It internally uses spatial calculations and may
    trigger additional updates to group member positions. The method assumes that
    the group has valid members and formation data; calling it on an invalid or empty
    group may result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling UpdateMetrics on a group without proper initialization can lead
    to incorrect positioning calculations. This method should not be called from multiple
    threads simultaneously without proper synchronization mechanisms. Avoid frequent
    calls during high-frequency events like combat or rapid movement to prevent performance
    degradation.
