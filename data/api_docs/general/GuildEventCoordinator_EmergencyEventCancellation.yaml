documentation:
  brief: Cancels an ongoing guild event by its unique identifier
  description: The EmergencyEventCancellation method is used to immediately terminate
    a guild event that is currently in progress. This function takes a unique event
    identifier and attempts to cancel the associated event, removing it from the active
    event queue and notifying all participants of the cancellation. The method is
    typically invoked during emergency situations or when an event organizer needs
    to halt an event prematurely. It ensures proper cleanup of event resources and
    updates the guild's event management system accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event to be cancelled. This value
      must correspond to a valid active event in the guild's event coordinator system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Cancel a Guild Event
    code: "GuildEventCoordinator* eventCoord = sGuildEventMgr->GetGuildEventCoordinator(guildId);\n\
      if (eventCoord)\n{\n    eventCoord->EmergencyEventCancellation(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called for events that are currently active and
    in progress. Attempting to cancel a non-existent or already completed event may
    result in undefined behavior. The cancellation process involves notifying all
    participants and cleaning up associated resources.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid eventId may lead to system instability
    or resource leaks. Always verify that the event exists and is currently active
    before invoking this function. This method should not be called from within event
    handlers to avoid potential deadlocks.
