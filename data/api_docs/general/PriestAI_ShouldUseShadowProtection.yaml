  method: ShouldUseShadowProtection
  signature: bool PriestAI::ShouldUseShadowProtection()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the priest should use Shadow Protection based on current
    combat state and spell availability.
  description: The ShouldUseShadowProtection method evaluates the current state of
    the PriestAI to decide if casting Shadow Protection would be beneficial. This
    includes checking for active threats, player health status, and whether the spell
    is currently available or on cooldown. The method typically integrates with the
    AI's decision-making process during combat scenarios where protective spells are
    needed. It serves as a conditional check before initiating the spell casting sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Shadow Protection should be cast; otherwise returns false.
    A return value of true indicates that the conditions for using the spell are met,
    such as presence of threat or low player health.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (priestAI->ShouldUseShadowProtection()) {\n    priestAI->CastSpell(SPELL_SHADOW_PROTECTION);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the general AI logic and may be called frequently
    during combat. It's recommended to cache its result if used multiple times within
    a single decision cycle to avoid redundant checks.
