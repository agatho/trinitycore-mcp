  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: SetMaxQueueSize
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::SetMaxQueueSize(uint32 maxSize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum queue size for bot spawn events in the event bus.
  description: The SetMaxQueueSize method configures the maximum number of bot spawn
    events that can be queued within the BotSpawnEventBus. This limit helps manage
    memory usage and processing load by preventing unlimited growth of the event queue.
    When the queue reaches its maximum capacity, additional bot spawn events may be
    dropped or handled according to the bus's overflow policy. The method accepts
    a single parameter representing the desired maximum size and updates the internal
    queue limit accordingly. This functionality is crucial for maintaining performance
    stability in environments with high bot activity or frequent spawn events.
  parameters:
  - name: maxSize
    description: The maximum number of bot spawn events that can be queued. Must be
      a positive integer value. Values of zero will typically result in no events
      being queued, while larger values allow more events to accumulate before processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Queue Size
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();

      eventBus->SetMaxQueueSize(1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Queue for High-Load Environment
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();

      // Configure for high bot activity with larger queue

      uint32 maxQueueSize = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_BOT_SPAWN_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE);

      eventBus->SetMaxQueueSize(maxQueueSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal queue management of the BotSpawnEventBus.
    It should be called during initialization or configuration phases, not during
    active event processing to avoid race conditions. The implementation likely involves
    thread-safe operations to ensure concurrent access safety when modifying the queue
    size.
  warnings: Setting the maximum queue size too high may lead to memory exhaustion
    under heavy bot spawn loads. Conversely, setting it too low might cause important
    spawn events to be dropped during peak activity periods. This method should not
    be called concurrently with event processing operations.
