  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckRaidConversion
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckRaidConversion(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player group should be converted to a raid based on current group
    state and configuration.
  description: The CheckRaidConversion method evaluates whether a player group meets
    the criteria for being automatically converted into a raid. This typically occurs
    when the group reaches a certain size or meets specific conditions defined by
    the server's configuration. The method modifies the provided GroupState parameter
    to reflect any necessary changes in group structure or behavior. It is commonly
    used in player bot systems to manage group dynamics and ensure proper raid formation
    for content progression.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that may need conversion to a raid. This
      represents the current player group being evaluated.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState object that will be updated with the new
      state after checking for possible raid conversion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player bot logic
    code: "void MyPlayerBot::Update()\n{\n    Group* group = GetGroup();\n    GroupState\
      \ state = GetGroupState();\n    PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckRaidConversion(group,\
      \ state);\n    SetGroupState(state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group updates or when new players
    join a group. It's important to note that the actual conversion logic may depend
    on server configuration settings such as minimum raid size requirements and group
    type restrictions.
  warnings: Improper handling of GroupState updates can lead to inconsistent group
    behavior. Always ensure that the GroupState is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
