  class: BotSpawnerFactory
  method: CreateSpawner
  signature: int BotSpawnerFactory::CreateSpawner(SpawnerType type)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot spawner instance of the specified type and returns its
    unique identifier.
  description: The CreateSpawner method is responsible for instantiating a new bot
    spawner within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts a SpawnerType parameter that
    determines the kind of spawner to create, such as a player-controlled or AI-driven
    spawner. The method initializes the spawner with default settings and registers
    it within the system. This function is typically used in bot management systems
    where dynamic creation of spawners is required for different gameplay scenarios.
    The returned identifier can be used to reference and manage the created spawner
    instance in subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the newly created spawner instance.
    A positive value indicates successful creation, while a negative value typically
    signifies an error or invalid spawner type was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spawner Creation
    code: "BotSpawnerFactory factory;\nint spawnerId = factory.CreateSpawner(SpawnerType::PLAYER_CONTROLLED);\n\
      if (spawnerId > 0) {\n    // Spawner created successfully\n    printf(\"Created\
      \ spawner with ID: %d\\n\", spawnerId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to create spawner\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotSpawnerFactory has been properly initialized
    and that the SpawnerType enum values are valid. The method may perform internal
    validation of the spawner type before creation, and could potentially throw exceptions
    or return error codes if invalid types are provided.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpawnerType parameter is valid to avoid undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper
    synchronization mechanisms in place.
