  brief: Sends PvP rewards to the player, including honor and arena points.
  description: The SendPvpRewards method is responsible for delivering PvP rewards
    to players who have earned honor points or arena points through competitive gameplay.
    This method typically triggers when a player's PvP stats are updated or when they
    participate in battlegrounds or arenas. It sends the appropriate reward notifications
    to the player's client, including any associated honor points, arena points, and
    other PvP-related benefits. The method is part of the Player class and is called
    internally during PvP progression updates.

  notes: This method is usually invoked during PvP-related events such as when a player
    wins a battleground or arena match. It may be called automatically by the game
    engine, but can also be manually triggered in certain scenarios. The method does
    not return any value and is purely for sending rewards.
  warnings: Care should be taken when calling this method in code, as it's typically
    invoked automatically during PvP events. Manual invocation could lead to duplicate
    reward delivery or client-side issues if not handled properly.
