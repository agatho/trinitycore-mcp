  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: IsQuestObjectiveComplete
  signature: bool DynamicQuestSystem::IsQuestObjectiveComplete(const QuestProgress
    & progress, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific quest objective has been completed based on the provided
    progress data and objective index.
  description: The IsQuestObjectiveComplete method evaluates whether a given quest
    objective, identified by its index within the QuestProgress structure, has been
    fully completed. This function is typically used during quest progression checks
    to determine if a player has met the requirements for a particular objective in
    a dynamic quest system. The method relies on the internal state of the QuestProgress
    object and the specified objective index to make this determination. It does not
    modify any data but serves as a read-only check for quest completion status.
  parameters:
  - name: progress
    description: A constant reference to a QuestProgress structure containing the
      current progress information for a quest, including objective counts and completion
      states.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer representing the zero-based index of the
      specific quest objective to check within the progress data. Must be a valid
      index within the range of objectives defined in the associated quest.
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the specified quest objective is complete
    (true) or not (false). Returns false if the objective index is out of bounds or
    if the progress data is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check a single objective
    code: "QuestProgress progress;\n// Assume progress is populated with valid quest\
      \ data\nbool isComplete = dynamicQuestSystem.IsQuestObjectiveComplete(progress,\
      \ 0);\nif (isComplete)\n{\n    // Handle objective completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple objectives in a loop
    code: "QuestProgress progress;\n// Assume progress is populated with valid quest\
      \ data\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i < progress.m_objectiveCount; ++i)\n{\n    if (dynamicQuestSystem.IsQuestObjectiveComplete(progress,\
      \ i))\n    {\n        // Process completed objective\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the QuestProgress object passed in contains valid
    and up-to-date information about quest objectives. The method does not perform
    any validation on the input parameters beyond checking if the objective index
    is within bounds of the progress data. For performance reasons, it's recommended
    to cache the results of this check when used frequently in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the QuestProgress object passed into this method is valid
    and corresponds to an active quest. Passing an uninitialized or corrupted QuestProgress
    structure may lead to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious with using indices
    beyond the actual number of objectives defined in the quest, as this could result
    in incorrect results or potential access violations.
