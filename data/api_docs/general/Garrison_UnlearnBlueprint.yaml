  class: Garrison

  signature: void Garrison::UnlearnBlueprint(uint32 garrBuildingId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a learned blueprint from the garrison for the specified building
    ID.
  description: The UnlearnBlueprint method removes a previously learned blueprint
    from the garrison's blueprint list for a specific building. This action typically
    occurs when a player decides to remove a building's blueprint from their garrison,
    which may be necessary when upgrading or replacing buildings. The method operates
    on the provided garrBuildingId parameter to identify which blueprint should be
    removed. It is part of the garrison management system and affects the player's
    ability to construct or upgrade specific building types within their garrison.
  parameters:
  - name: garrBuildingId
    description: The unique identifier for the garrison building whose blueprint should
      be unlearned. This ID corresponds to a specific building type in the game's
      garrison system and determines which blueprint will be removed from the player's
      learned blueprints.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unlearn a Blueprint for a Specific Building
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison)\n{\n    garrison->UnlearnBlueprint(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the garrison building management
    system and may trigger updates to the player's garrison UI. It does not validate
    whether the blueprint was actually learned before attempting removal, so calling
    it on an unlearned blueprint may have no effect.
  warnings: Ensure that the garrBuildingId provided is valid and corresponds to an
    actual building in the game's database. Calling this method with an invalid ID
    may lead to undefined behavior or silent failures within the garrison system.
