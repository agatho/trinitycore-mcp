  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: LogTrackingEvent
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::LogTrackingEvent(uint32 botGuid, const std::string
    & event, const std::string & details)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a tracking event for a specific bot with associated details.
  description: The LogTrackingEvent method records a tracking event for a specified
    bot identified by its GUID. This method is typically used within the ObjectiveTracker
    system to maintain logs of player or NPC activities related to objectives, quests,
    or other tracked events in the game world. The event string describes the type
    of activity being logged, while the details string provides additional context
    or data about that event. This functionality supports debugging, analytics, and
    gameplay tracking within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the tracking event
      is being logged. This value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      a bot entity in the game world.
  - name: event
    description: A string describing the type of tracking event that occurred. This
      should be a concise, meaningful identifier for the activity being tracked (e.g.,
      'QuestAccepted', 'ObjectiveCompleted').
  - name: details
    description: A string containing additional information or context about the tracking
      event. This may include parameters, values, or other relevant data that supplements
      the event description.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = sObjectMgr->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->LogTrackingEvent(12345, "QuestAccepted", "Player accepted Quest ID:
      9876");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Data
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string eventStr = "ObjectiveUpdated";

      std::string detailsStr = "Objective ID: " + std::to_string(objectiveId) + ",
      Progress: " + std::to_string(progress);

      tracker->LogTrackingEvent(botGuid, eventStr, detailsStr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely writes to an internal log or database for tracking purposes.
    It is designed to be lightweight and non-blocking to avoid performance impact
    during gameplay. The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform
    validation on GUIDs or event strings.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid corresponds to a valid bot entity in the game world,
    otherwise the logging may fail silently or produce incorrect results. Avoid using
    long or unstructured detail strings as they might affect log storage efficiency.
