documentation:
  brief: Removes a petition from the database and associated data structures.
  description: The RemovePetition method is responsible for deleting a specific petition
    identified by its unique identifier (GUID) from the game's petition management
    system. This action typically occurs when a petition is cancelled, expires, or
    is otherwise no longer valid. The method ensures that all references to the petition
    are removed from internal data structures and the underlying database. It may
    also handle cleanup of related data such as signatures or associated player records.
    The operation is generally irreversible and affects only the specified petition
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: petitionGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the petition to be removed. This
      value must correspond to an existing petition in the database, otherwise the
      method may have no effect or throw an error.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Petition Removal
    code: PetitionMgr::instance()->RemovePetition(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Petition Removal
    code: "if (petitionGuid > 0)\n{\n    PetitionMgr::instance()->RemovePetition(petitionGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations and should be called carefully
    to avoid unintended data loss. It may trigger additional cleanup routines for
    related signatures or player records. The method is typically thread-safe if the
    underlying PetitionMgr implementation uses appropriate synchronization mechanisms.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent petition GUID may
    result in undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Always verify that the
    petition exists before attempting removal.
