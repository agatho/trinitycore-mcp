  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: ExecuteSQLStatement
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ExecuteSQLStatement(const std::string & sql)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a provided SQL statement within the playerbot migration manager
    context.
  description: The ExecuteSQLStatement method is responsible for executing arbitrary
    SQL commands through the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class. This method allows for database
    operations such as data modification, retrieval, or schema changes that are necessary
    for managing player bot configurations and migrations. It serves as a core interface
    for interacting with the underlying database system to support player bot functionality
    within TrinityCore. The method handles SQL execution safely and returns a boolean
    indicating success or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: sql
    description: A constant reference to a string containing the SQL statement to
      be executed. This should be a properly formatted SQL command that is valid for
      the target database system.
  returns: Returns true if the SQL statement was executed successfully, false otherwise.
    Failure can occur due to invalid SQL syntax, database connection issues, or permission
    restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic SQL Execution
    code: bool success = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ExecuteSQLStatement("INSERT INTO playerbot_config
      (guid, config_name, config_value) VALUES (12345, 'auto_loot', 'true');");
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Configuration Data
    code: 'std::string updateQuery = "UPDATE playerbot_config SET config_value = ''false''
      WHERE config_name = ''auto_loot'';";

      bool result = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ExecuteSQLStatement(updateQuery);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly interacts with the database.
    Ensure that SQL statements are properly escaped and validated to prevent SQL injection
    vulnerabilities. The method may block execution until the database operation completes,
    so consider performance implications when executing long-running queries.
  warnings: Do not pass untrusted user input directly into this method without proper
    sanitization. Improperly formatted SQL statements can cause database errors or
    security issues. Always validate and sanitize SQL inputs before calling this method.
