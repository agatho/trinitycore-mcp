  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: IsInCleaveZone
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::IsInCleaveZone(Player * bot, Unit * source)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is within the cleave attack zone of a source
    unit.
  description: The IsInCleaveZone method evaluates if a given player character is
    positioned within the effective cleave range of a specified source unit. This
    functionality is commonly used in AI behavior logic to determine when a bot should
    perform cleave-based attacks or positioning maneuvers. The method considers the
    combat mechanics of cleave abilities, which typically allow a player to hit multiple
    nearby enemies within a defined angular and distance range from the primary target.
    It's particularly relevant for melee classes that utilize cleave-style abilities
    such as Warrior's Cleave or Rogue's Fan of Knives.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      being evaluated for cleave zone inclusion.
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the source of the cleave
      attack, typically the target or origin of the cleave ability.
  returns: Returns true if the bot player is within the cleave zone of the source
    unit; otherwise returns false. The determination considers both distance and angular
    positioning relative to the source.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->IsInCleaveZone(bot, target)) {\n    bot->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_CLEAVE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat routine to optimize cleave usage
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->IsInCleaveZone(player, currentTarget)) {\n    //\
      \ Check if there are additional targets in cleave range\n    if (player->GetMap()->GetPlayersInRange(player->GetPosition(),\
      \ 5.0f, true).size() > 1) {\n        player->CastSpell(currentTarget, SPELL_CLEAVE,\
      \ true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal distance and angle calculations to determine
    cleave zone inclusion. It may be sensitive to the positioning of both the bot
    and source units, and could be affected by terrain or obstruction checks in some
    implementations. The exact cleave parameters (angle, radius) are typically defined
    by the game mechanics and may vary per ability.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'source' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method to avoid null pointer dereferences. This method might not
    account for all environmental factors like line of sight or terrain obstructions
    in its evaluation.
