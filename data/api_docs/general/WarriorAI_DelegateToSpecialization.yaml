  class: WarriorAI
  method: DelegateToSpecialization
  signature: void WarriorAI::DelegateToSpecialization(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Delegates AI behavior to the warrior's current specialization-specific logic.
  description: The DelegateToSpecialization method in WarriorAI is responsible for
    routing the AI's decision-making process to the appropriate specialization-specific
    implementation. This allows the warrior AI to dynamically adapt its behavior based
    on the player's chosen specialization, such as Arms, Fury, or Protection. The
    method likely evaluates the current state of the warrior and redirects control
    flow to the relevant specialization handler. It is typically called during AI
    update cycles when the system needs to determine the most appropriate action based
    on the warrior's current role and combat situation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object representing the target enemy or ally that the warrior
      AI should consider when making specialization-specific decisions. This parameter
      is essential for determining appropriate actions such as targeting, threat management,
      or ability selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    DelegateToSpecialization(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with specialization-specific combat logic
    code: "void WarriorAI::DelegateToSpecialization(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (me->GetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0)\
      \ & 0x00000001)\n        // Execute Arms specialization logic\n        DoArmsCombat(target);\n\
      \    else if (me->GetUInt32Value(UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0) & 0x00000002)\n       \
      \ // Execute Fury specialization logic\n        DoFuryCombat(target);\n    else\n\
      \        // Default Protection logic\n        DoProtectionCombat(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and relies on the warrior's
    current specialization state being properly maintained. The implementation may
    involve checking internal flags or variables that indicate which specialization
    is active. Developers should ensure that all specialization-specific logic paths
    are properly implemented and tested.
  warnings: Improper handling of specialization states could lead to incorrect behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer may cause undefined behavior. This method should only
    be called when the AI has a valid combat state.
