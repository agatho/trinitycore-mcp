  signature: const int & Quest::GetConditionalQuestDescription() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the conditional quest description identifier for the current quest.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier associated with a conditional
    quest description within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically used in quest-related
    logic to distinguish between different conditional quest states or descriptions.
    The method returns an integer value representing the quest description ID, which
    can be used for various game mechanics such as quest tracking, conditional quest
    validation, or determining quest completion status. This identifier is crucial
    for maintaining proper quest progression and ensuring correct handling of conditional
    quest events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the integer identifier representing the conditional quest description.
    This value typically corresponds to a specific quest description ID in the database
    that defines how the quest should be handled under certain conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int questDescId = quest->GetConditionalQuestDescription();\nif (questDescId\
      \ == 12345) {\n    // Handle conditional quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods. It's important to note that this identifier
    may vary depending on the specific quest implementation and database configuration.
    Performance-wise, it's recommended to cache this value if frequently accessed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return different values based
    on quest state or conditional logic. Ensure proper validation before using the
    returned ID in conditional logic.
