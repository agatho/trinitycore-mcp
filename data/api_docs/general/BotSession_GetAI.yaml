documentation:
  brief: Returns the BotAI instance associated with this session for AI behavior control.
  description: The GetAI method retrieves the BotAI object that manages the artificial
    intelligence behaviors and decision-making logic for a specific bot session. This
    method provides access to the core AI functionality that controls how the bot
    interacts with the game world, including movement, combat decisions, and quest
    behavior. The returned BotAI pointer is typically used by other systems to query
    or modify the bot's current state and behavior patterns. This method is essential
    for integrating custom AI logic or accessing existing bot behaviors within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotAI object associated with this session, or nullptr
    if no AI has been initialized for the session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Access
    code: "BotAI* ai = session->GetAI();\nif (ai != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the AI\
      \ object to control bot behavior\n    ai->UpdateAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking AI State
    code: "BotSession* session = sObjectAccessor->GetBotSession(playerGuid);\nif (session)\n\
      {\n    BotAI* ai = session->GetAI();\n    if (ai && ai->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        // Handle combat state\n        ai->DoCombatAction();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BotAI pointer is valid only as long as the session remains active.
    Accessing the AI after the session has been destroyed may result in undefined
    behavior. This method does not perform any initialization of the AI object; it
    simply returns a reference to an already existing instance.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned BotAI pointer is non-null. Always check
    for nullptr before using the returned value to prevent segmentation faults. The
    AI object should not be deleted or modified directly by external code as it's
    managed internally by the session.
