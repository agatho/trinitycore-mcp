documentation:
  brief: Returns the message of the day (MOTD) for the guild
  description: Retrieves the current message of the day set for the guild. The MOTD
    is a customizable string displayed to guild members when they join or access guild
    information. This method provides read-only access to the stored MOTD value and
    does not modify the guild's state. The returned reference points to an internal
    string managed by the guild object, ensuring consistency with the guild's current
    MOTD setting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the guild's message of
    the day. The string will be empty if no MOTD has been set.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display guild MOTD
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n\
      {\n    std::string motd = myGuild->GetMOTD();\n    if (!motd.empty())\n    {\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Guild MOTD: \" << motd << std::endl;\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        std::cout << \"No MOTD set for this guild.\" << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string reference is valid only as long as the Guild object exists
    and is not modified by other operations. This method is thread-safe in the context
    of TrinityCore's object management, but direct access to the guild object should
    be protected if accessed from multiple threads.
