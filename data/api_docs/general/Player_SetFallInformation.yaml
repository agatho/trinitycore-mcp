  class: Player
  method: SetFallInformation
  signature: void Player::SetFallInformation(uint32 time, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the fall information for a player, including time and vertical position
    during falling.
  description: The SetFallInformation method is used to update the fall state of a
    player by specifying the time elapsed since the start of the fall and the current
    Z coordinate (vertical position). This method is typically invoked when a player
    is falling in the game world, such as during jump or fall mechanics. It allows
    developers to control how long a player has been falling and at what height they
    currently are, which is essential for accurate physics simulation and movement
    handling in World of Warcraft. The method directly affects the player's fall behavior
    and is often used in conjunction with other movement-related functions.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The time elapsed since the start of the fall, measured in milliseconds.
      This value determines how long the player has been falling.
  - name: z
    description: The vertical position (Z coordinate) of the player during the fall.
      This represents the current height above ground level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetFallInformation(1000, 50.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      float z = player->GetPositionZ();

      uint32 time = 500;

      player->SetFallInformation(time, z);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement system and directly influences how fall
    physics are handled in the game. It should be used carefully as it affects player
    movement and can impact gameplay mechanics such as falling damage or landing behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause incorrect fall calculations, leading
    to unexpected player behavior or even client-side crashes if not handled properly.
    Ensure that time values are valid and Z coordinates are within expected bounds.
