  signature: bool LLMProvider::IsAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the LLM provider is available and ready for use
  description: The IsAvailable method determines whether the Large Language Model
    (LLM) provider has been properly initialized and is capable of processing requests.
    This method typically checks internal state flags, connection status, or resource
    availability to ensure the provider can handle incoming prompts. The check is
    usually performed before attempting to use the LLM functionality to prevent runtime
    errors or failed operations. In World of Warcraft contexts, this might be used
    to verify that AI-driven NPC dialogue systems or in-game assistant features are
    operational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the LLM provider is fully initialized and ready to process
    requests; returns false if the provider is not available due to initialization
    failure, missing dependencies, or resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Availability Check
    code: "if (llmProvider.IsAvailable()) {\n    // Proceed with LLM operations\n\
      \    std::string response = llmProvider.ProcessPrompt(\"Hello world\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle unavailable state\n    sLog->outError(\"LLM provider is not\
      \ available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with NPC Dialogue System
    code: "void NPC::OnGossipHello(Player* player) {\n    if (sLLMProvider.IsAvailable())\
      \ {\n        // Enable AI-powered dialogue options\n        AddGossipItemFor(player,\
      \ GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Ask about the realm\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n    }\
      \ else {\n        // Fallback to standard dialogue\n        AddGossipItemFor(player,\
      \ GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT, \"Standard greeting\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 2);\n    }\n\
      \    SendGossipMenuFor(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lightweight check and should not block execution.
    It's recommended to cache the result of this check if multiple operations depend
    on LLM availability within the same context. The implementation may vary depending
    on how the LLM provider is configured (e.g., local vs remote service).
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees successful prompt processing,
    as individual requests might still fail due to timeouts or model-specific issues.
    Always implement proper error handling around actual LLM usage.
