documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat metric collection for AI behavior analysis
  description: Starts the capture of performance and behavioral metrics during combat
    scenarios. This method enables detailed tracking of AI decision-making processes,
    reaction times, and overall combat effectiveness. The captured data is used for
    tuning AI behaviors, identifying performance bottlenecks, and analyzing combat
    patterns in World of Warcraft encounters. The method typically initializes internal
    timers, data structures, and logging mechanisms required for comprehensive combat
    analytics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Integration
    code: 'CombatAIIntegrator aiIntegrator;

      aiIntegrator.StartMetricCapture();

      // Metrics collection now active for subsequent combat events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any combat-related AI operations to ensure
    accurate metric collection. The captured metrics are typically stored in internal
    buffers and may be flushed or processed at specific intervals during combat. Performance
    impact is minimal as the method only initializes tracking mechanisms without active
    data processing during normal operation.
  warnings: Ensure that StartMetricCapture() is called before any combat events occur,
    otherwise early metrics will be missed. The method does not validate if metrics
    are already being captured, so calling it multiple times may result in undefined
    behavior or duplicate data entries.
