  method: StartPerformanceTimer
  signature: void EconomyManager::StartPerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a performance timer for monitoring economy-related operations.
  description: The StartPerformanceTimer method begins recording execution time for
    economy-related activities within the TrinityCore server. This method is typically
    used to measure the performance of various economic systems such as item transactions,
    currency exchanges, or auction house operations. It sets up internal timing mechanisms
    that can be later queried or logged for debugging and optimization purposes. The
    timer is generally non-blocking and does not interfere with normal gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sWorld->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->StartPerformanceTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely initializes internal performance tracking variables and
    may be paired with a corresponding StopPerformanceTimer() method. The timer data
    is typically stored in a thread-local storage to avoid race conditions during
    concurrent server operations.
