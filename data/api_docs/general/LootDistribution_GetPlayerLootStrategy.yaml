  class: LootDistribution
  method: GetPlayerLootStrategy
  signature: LootDecisionStrategy LootDistribution::GetPlayerLootStrategy(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot distribution strategy assigned to a specific player.
  description: The GetPlayerLootStrategy method fetches the current loot decision
    strategy that is applied to a player within the TrinityCore framework. This strategy
    determines how loot is distributed among group members, such as using round-robin,
    master loot, or free-for-all mechanisms. The method uses the provided player's
    unique identifier (GUID) to look up and return the appropriate strategy. It is
    typically used during loot distribution events to ensure proper handling of item
    assignment according to configured group rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootDecisionStrategy enum value indicating the loot distribution method
    assigned to the specified player. Possible values may include ROUND_ROBIN, MASTER_LOOT,
    FREE_FOR_ALL, or others depending on the server configuration and group settings.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a Player's Loot Strategy
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nLootDecisionStrategy strategy = lootDistribution->GetPlayerLootStrategy(playerId);\n\
      switch (strategy)\n{\n    case ROUND_ROBIN:\n        // Handle round-robin loot\
      \ logic\n        break;\n    case MASTER_LOOT:\n        // Handle master loot\
      \ logic\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Default loot handling\n  \
      \      break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player GUID is valid and corresponds to an active
    player in the game world. The returned strategy may vary based on group settings,
    server rules, or player permissions. Ensure proper synchronization when accessing
    this data in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent player GUIDs as it
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the player exists
    and is part of a valid group before retrieving their loot strategy.
