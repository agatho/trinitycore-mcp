  signature: int & RoleDefinitions::GetClassDefinitions()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a reference to the internal class definitions container used for
    role-based access control in TrinityCore.
  description: The GetClassDefinitions method provides access to the internal collection
    of class definitions that are utilized for determining role-based permissions
    and access levels within the TrinityCore framework. This method returns a reference
    to an integer array or container that holds predefined class identifiers or flags
    associated with different player classes, roles, or game mechanics such as raid
    groups, dungeons, or special character types. The returned reference allows direct
    manipulation of these definitions, which are critical for enforcing game rules
    and access control policies. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    other role management functions to dynamically adjust permissions based on player
    class or group composition.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer container holding class definitions used for
    role-based access control. The exact structure depends on internal implementation
    but generally represents a mapping of class identifiers or permission flags.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Class Definitions for Role Management
    code: "RoleDefinitions& roleDefs = sObjectMgr->GetRoleDefinitions();\nint& classDefs\
      \ = roleDefs.GetClassDefinitions();\n// Use classDefs to check or modify role-based\
      \ access rules\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < classDefs.size(); ++i)\n{\n    if (classDefs[i]\
      \ == PLAYER_CLASS_WARRIOR)\n        // Apply warrior-specific permissions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a direct reference to internal data structures, so modifications
    should be handled carefully to avoid unintended side effects. The returned container
    may be shared across multiple systems and should not be modified without proper
    synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Modifying the returned integer reference directly can affect global access
    control behavior. Ensure thread safety when modifying these definitions in concurrent
    environments. Changes made to this container might impact gameplay mechanics and
    should be thoroughly tested.
