api:
  class: SpellHistory
  method: GetMaxCharges
  signature: int SpellHistory::GetMaxCharges(int chargeCategoryId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum number of charges allowed for a specified spell charge
    category.
  description: The GetMaxCharges method returns the maximum number of times a spell
    with a given charge category can be used before it enters a cooldown period. This
    functionality is integral to managing spell usage limits in World of Warcraft's
    combat system, particularly for abilities that have limited uses per minute or
    are subject to cooldowns based on charge consumption. The method takes a charge
    category ID as input and retrieves the associated maximum charge value from internal
    spell history tracking data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: chargeCategoryId
    description: An integer identifier representing the spell charge category. This
      ID corresponds to predefined categories in the game's spell system that define
      how many charges a spell can have before entering cooldown.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the maximum number of charges allowed
    for the specified charge category. A return value of 0 or negative indicates no
    charges are available or an invalid category ID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int maxCharges = spellHistory->GetMaxCharges(12345);\nif (maxCharges >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Use the maximum charges value for logic\n    std::cout << \"\
      Maximum charges: \" << maxCharges << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Charge Category Validation
    code: "int chargeId = 54321;\nint maxCharges = spellHistory->GetMaxCharges(chargeId);\n\
      if (maxCharges <= 0)\n{\n    // Handle invalid charge category\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid charge category ID: %d\", chargeId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ valid charge handling\n    player->SetSpellChargeCategoryMaxCharges(chargeId,\
      \ maxCharges);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell history tracking
    functions to manage cooldowns and charge systems. The internal implementation
    likely relies on cached data structures for performance optimization, so frequent
    calls should be considered carefully in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided chargeCategoryId corresponds to a valid spell
    charge category defined in the game's database or spell definitions; otherwise,
    unexpected behavior may occur. This method does not validate the existence of
    the category ID itself, which could lead to incorrect results if an invalid ID
    is passed.
