documentation:
  brief: Initializes and populates object data values for a corpse during creation
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for setting up the initial
    data fields and object values for a Corpse object when it is first created in
    the game world. This method prepares the corpse's data structure by filling in
    relevant fields such as display ID, faction, and other properties that define
    how the corpse appears and behaves. It is typically called internally during the
    corpse creation process, ensuring that all necessary data is properly initialized
    before the corpse becomes visible to players. The method operates on a provided
    data array and applies the specified flags to determine which values should be
    set.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the object values will be written.
      This array is used to store the serialized data for the corpse's fields.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that determine which specific data fields should be
      populated in the data array. These flags control the behavior and scope of what
      gets initialized during creation.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to a target integer array, potentially used for copying or
      referencing existing values during initialization. May be null if not needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in corpse creation
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      int data[OBJECT_END];

      int flags = 0;

      const int* target = nullptr;

      corpse->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with specific flags for detailed initialization
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      int data[OBJECT_END];

      int flags = 1; // Example flag value

      const int* target = nullptr;

      corpse->BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);

      // Data array now contains initialized values for the corpse'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal object creation pipeline and should not
    typically be called directly by external code. It's designed to work with TrinityCore's
    object update system and relies on proper memory layout expectations. The data
    array must be large enough to hold all required values for the corpse type.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the data array may
    lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior. Ensure that the target data buffer
    is properly allocated and sized before calling this method.
