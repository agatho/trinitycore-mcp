  signature: void Map::Balance()
documentation:
  brief: Balances the map's internal data structures and resource allocation for optimal
    performance.
  description: The Map::Balance method is responsible for maintaining efficient resource
    usage and data structure integrity within a game map instance. This method typically
    performs internal balancing operations such as redistributing objects, adjusting
    memory allocations, or reorganizing spatial partitioning structures to ensure
    consistent performance across the map. It may also handle load balancing between
    different map instances or subsystems, particularly in multi-threaded environments
    where resource contention could occur. The exact implementation details are internal
    to TrinityCore's core systems and may vary depending on the specific map type
    and current system state.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Map::Balance
    code: "Map* map = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);\nif (map)\n{\n    map->Balance();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop or during
    specific maintenance operations. It may perform blocking operations that could
    affect performance if called frequently. Developers should not rely on this method
    for deterministic behavior as it's primarily used for internal optimization purposes.
  warnings: Calling Map::Balance manually from outside core systems may lead to unexpected
    behavior or performance degradation. This method is intended for internal use
    only and should not be invoked directly by custom modules or addons.
