  signature: void DungeonBehavior::UpdateEncounterDifficulty(uint32 encounterId, float
    performanceRating)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the difficulty rating for a specific dungeon encounter based on performance
    metrics.
  description: The UpdateEncounterDifficulty method adjusts the difficulty level of
    a dungeon encounter by evaluating the player's performance rating. This function
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to
    dynamically modify encounter challenges based on group performance, ensuring that
    subsequent runs of the same dungeon adapt to the skill level of the players. The
    method likely modifies internal encounter state variables and may influence loot
    distribution, enemy scaling, or other dynamic difficulty settings within the dungeon
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific dungeon encounter being updated.
      This ID corresponds to a defined encounter in the game's database and is used
      to locate the correct encounter data for modification.
  - name: performanceRating
    description: Floating-point value representing the performance score of the player
      or group during the encounter. Higher values typically indicate better performance,
      which may lead to increased difficulty adjustments or rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeon = ...;

      dungeon->UpdateEncounterDifficulty(12345, 87.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance-Based Difficulty Adjustment
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeon = GetPlayerDungeonBehavior();

      float rating = CalculateGroupPerformance();

      dungeon->UpdateEncounterDifficulty(GetCurrentEncounterId(), rating);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal encounter state management
    system and may trigger updates to the dungeon's difficulty modifiers. It is expected
    to be called after an encounter completion event, possibly as part of a larger
    encounter lifecycle management process.
  warnings: Ensure that the encounterId corresponds to a valid encounter in the database;
    invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors. The performanceRating should
    be within reasonable bounds to prevent unexpected difficulty adjustments.
