documentation:
  brief: Destroys an RBACData object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the RBACData class is responsible for cleaning up
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed by this instance.
    In the context of TrinityCore's authentication and access control system, RBACData
    typically holds role-based access control information for players or accounts.
    When an RBACData object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, its destructor
    ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. This method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations as it is a destructor.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of RBACData object
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    RBACData data;\n    // ... use data ...\n} //\
      \ Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of RBACData pointer
    code: 'RBACData* dataPtr = new RBACData();

      // ... use dataPtr ...

      delete dataPtr; // Calls destructor explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references
    to the RBACData instance after its destruction, as accessing freed memory can
    lead to undefined behavior.
