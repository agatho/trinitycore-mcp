documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles interrupt events for multiple targets within the game
    world
  description: The HandleMultipleInterruptTargets method manages the logic for interrupting
    ongoing spell casts or abilities on multiple affected targets simultaneously.
    This method is typically invoked during combat scenarios where a single spell
    or ability affects several enemies, ensuring that each target's current casting
    state is properly interrupted according to game mechanics and rules. It handles
    the coordination of interrupt events across multiple entities, updating their
    states and potentially triggering related callbacks or notifications in the game
    engine.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void CombatHandler::ApplyAreaOfEffectInterrupt(Spell* spell)\n{\n    InterruptManager::HandleMultipleInterruptTargets();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within a synchronized context and may interact
    with the global interrupt queue or target tracking systems. Performance considerations
    should be taken into account when dealing with large numbers of simultaneous interrupts.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to inconsistent spell states
    or unexpected behavior in combat mechanics, especially when multiple threads are
    involved in spell processing.
