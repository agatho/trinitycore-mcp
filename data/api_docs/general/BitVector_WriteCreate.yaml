  class: BitVector
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void BitVector::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes bit vector create data to a ByteBuffer for transmission to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state of a BitVector object into
    a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to a specific player. This
    method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to send updates
    about bit flags or boolean states to clients. The data written includes the necessary
    metadata and flag values that represent the current state of the bit vector, formatted
    according to the game's packet structure. It takes into account the owner of the
    data and the receiving player to ensure proper serialization for client interpretation.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer to which the serialized bit vector data will be written.
      This buffer is typically used to construct network packets.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that owns this bit vector. Used to determine
      ownership context for serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this data. Used to
      customize serialization based on the receiver's perspective or permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Packet Construction
    code: 'BitVector bitVec;

      // ... set some flags ...

      ByteBuffer buffer;

      Player* owner = session->GetPlayer();

      Player* receiver = targetPlayer;

      bitVec.WriteCreate(buffer, owner, receiver);

      // buffer now contains the serialized bit vector data ready for sending'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the serialization system used by TrinityCore to send
    object state updates over the network. The implementation likely handles endian
    conversion and proper data packing according to WoW's protocol specifications.
    It may also perform access checks or filtering based on the receiver's permissions.
  warnings: Ensure that the ByteBuffer has sufficient capacity before calling this
    method, as it will append data without checking for overflow. Also, be careful
    when using null pointers for owner or receiver parameters, as they could lead
    to undefined behavior if not properly validated.
