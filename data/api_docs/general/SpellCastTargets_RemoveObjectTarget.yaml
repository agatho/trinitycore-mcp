  signature: void SpellCastTargets::RemoveObjectTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the object target from the spell cast targets container.
  description: The RemoveObjectTarget method removes the currently set object target
    from the SpellCastTargets instance. This method is typically used during spell
    casting logic to clear or unset a previously specified target object, such as
    a unit or game object, that was being targeted for a spell effect. It ensures
    that the spell cast targets no longer reference the removed object, which may
    be necessary when the target becomes invalid, moves out of range, or when the
    spell's targeting logic needs to be reset. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no validation on whether a target was actually set before removal.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing an object target from a spell cast
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      targets.AddUnitTarget(targetUnit);

      // ... perform spell logic ...

      targets.RemoveObjectTarget(); // Clear the target after use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell targeting system in TrinityCore and should
    be used in conjunction with other target management methods like AddUnitTarget
    or AddGOTarget. It does not perform any cleanup of associated data beyond removing
    the reference to the object.
