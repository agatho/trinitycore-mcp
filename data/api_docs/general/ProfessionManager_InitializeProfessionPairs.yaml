  class: ProfessionManager
  method: InitializeProfessionPairs
  signature: void ProfessionManager::InitializeProfessionPairs()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the mapping of profession IDs to their corresponding skill line
    IDs for all available professions in the game.
  description: The InitializeProfessionPairs method sets up internal data structures
    that map each profession's unique identifier to its associated skill line ID.
    This is essential for tracking player progress, determining skill requirements,
    and managing profession-related game mechanics such as crafting, gathering, and
    skill advancement. The method typically runs during server initialization or when
    loading profession data from the database. It ensures that all professions are
    properly registered within the system before players can interact with them.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ProfessionManager* pm = sProfessionManager;

      pm->InitializeProfessionPairs();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when reloading
    profession data. Repeated calls may result in duplicate entries or memory leaks
    if not handled properly. The internal mapping is used extensively by other methods
    like GetSkillLineForProfession and IsProfessionValid.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you are certain about the implications,
    as it's usually invoked automatically during server initialization. Improper usage
    can lead to inconsistent profession data or crashes if dependent systems try to
    access uninitialized mappings.
