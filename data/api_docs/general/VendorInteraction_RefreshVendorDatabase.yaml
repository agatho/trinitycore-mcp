  brief: Refreshes the vendor's item database with updated information from the game
    world.
  description: The RefreshVendorDatabase method updates the internal database of items
    available for sale by a vendor. This function ensures that the vendor's inventory
    reflects any changes made in the game world, such as item additions, removals,
    or modifications to item properties. It is typically invoked when vendors need
    to synchronize their stock with the current state of the game server. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations; instead,
    it modifies the vendor's internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage

  notes: This method should be called periodically or upon specific events that might
    affect vendor inventory, such as server restarts or item modifications. It is
    not thread-safe and should only be executed in a single-threaded context to prevent
    race conditions.
  warnings: Improper use of this function without proper synchronization can lead
    to inconsistent vendor inventories or crashes. Avoid calling this method during
    active transactions with players.
