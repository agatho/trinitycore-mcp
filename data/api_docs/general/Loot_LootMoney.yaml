  brief: Calculates and distributes gold loot to players in the group.
  description: The Loot::LootMoney method handles the distribution of monetary rewards
    from creature kills or game object looting. It calculates the appropriate gold
    amount based on the loot template, applies any applicable modifiers such as group
    size bonuses or quest multipliers, and distributes the gold to eligible players
    within the group. This method is typically invoked during the loot processing
    phase after a successful loot roll or when a player opens a loot container. The
    method ensures proper gold distribution according to World of Warcraft's loot
    rules and group dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Processing
    code: "void Creature::GenerateLoot()\n{\n    // ... other loot generation code\
      \ ...\n    loot.LootMoney(); // Distribute gold loot to group members\n    //\
      \ ... continue with item distribution ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal loot template and group information. It
    assumes that the Loot object has been properly initialized with valid group data
    and loot entries. The actual gold distribution happens through player-specific
    methods, not directly within this function.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of proper loot processing contexts as
    it depends on group state and loot template data. Calling it without a valid loot
    context may result in incorrect gold distribution or crashes.
