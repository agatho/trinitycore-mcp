  method: CanGiveExperience
  signature: bool Creature::CanGiveExperience() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature can provide experience points to players.
  description: The CanGiveExperience method checks if a creature is capable of granting
    experience points to player characters. This method evaluates various conditions
    such as the creature's level, faction status, and player's level difference to
    determine if experience can be awarded. It is commonly used in quest completion
    logic and NPC interaction handling within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature can provide experience points to players,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to level restrictions, faction
    status, or other game mechanics that prevent experience awarding.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->CanGiveExperience()) {\n    // Creature can provide experience\n\
      \    // Proceed with experience award logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: In quest completion context
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nif (creature->CanGiveExperience()\
      \ && player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE) {\n    // Award\
      \ experience\n    player->AddExperience(experienceAmount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other experience-related
    methods to determine if a creature should award experience points. The implementation
    may vary based on the creature's type and faction status.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that experience will be awarded; it only
    indicates whether the creature can provide experience points. Actual experience
    awarding depends on additional factors like player level, quest completion status,
    and other game mechanics.
