  method: OptimizeStanceDancing
  signature: void WarriorAI::OptimizeStanceDancing(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes stance dancing behavior for a warrior AI based on target engagement.
  description: The OptimizeStanceDancing method adjusts the warrior's combat stance
    dynamically to maximize damage output or defensive capabilities depending on the
    current target and combat situation. This method evaluates the AI's current stance,
    target threat level, and available abilities to determine whether switching stances
    would improve overall performance. It is typically called during combat updates
    to ensure optimal stance usage without unnecessary transitions that could disrupt
    attack timing or resource management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     OptimizeStanceDancing(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and assumes that the target
    is valid and engaged in combat. The stance optimization logic considers factors
    such as weapon type, available abilities, and threat level to make decisions.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or with a null target may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect stance transitions. Ensure target validity before
    invoking this function.
