  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: IsInInteractionRange
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsInInteractionRange(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is within the interaction range of a specified
    NPC.
  description: The IsInInteractionRange method checks if the player associated with
    the current NPCInteractionManager instance is within the defined interaction distance
    of the provided Creature object. This method is typically used in NPC interaction
    logic to ensure that player actions such as talking, trading, or quest interactions
    only occur when the player is close enough to the NPC. The range check considers
    the actual distance between the player and the NPC in 3D space, taking into account
    the NPC's interaction radius and the player's current position. This method does
    not perform any side effects and is purely a query operation.
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC to check against.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing NPC; passing nullptr will result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the interaction range of the specified
    NPC, false otherwise. The exact distance threshold is determined by the game's
    configuration and the NPC's defined interaction radius.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Greeting
    code: "if (interactionManager.IsInInteractionRange(npc)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ NPC greeting logic\n    npc->Say(\"Hello, adventurer!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL, nullptr);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player is too far away\n    player->SendSysMessage(\"You are\
      \ too far away to interact with this NPC.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Interaction Range Before Quest Acceptance
    code: "if (interactionManager.IsInInteractionRange(questGiver)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ quest acceptance\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->GetQuestMenu().AddMenuItem(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent quest interaction if out of range\n    player->SendSysMessage(\"\
      You must move closer to accept this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the NPCInteractionManager and
    assumes that it has been properly initialized with a valid player context. The
    interaction range is typically defined by the game's core configuration files
    and may vary between different types of NPCs. Performance-wise, this method performs
    a simple distance calculation and should be fast enough for frequent calls during
    gameplay.
  warnings: Do not pass nullptr as the npc parameter; doing so will likely cause a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Creature pointer is valid and represents
    an actual NPC in the world before calling this method.
