  class: MountManager
  method: IsMultiPassengerMount
  signature: bool MountManager::IsMultiPassengerMount(const MountInfo & mount) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified mount allows multiple passengers.
  description: The IsMultiPassengerMount method checks if a given mount entry supports
    having more than one passenger at a time. This is used internally by the game
    engine to control mount behavior, such as enabling or disabling multi-passenger
    functionality for specific mounts. The method evaluates the mount's properties
    and returns true if the mount can accommodate additional riders beyond the primary
    rider.
  parameters:
  - name: mount
    description: A constant reference to a MountInfo structure that contains the mount's
      configuration data, including its flags and properties that determine passenger
      capacity.
  returns: Returns true if the specified mount supports multiple passengers; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the mount can be ridden by more than one
    player simultaneously.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a mount allows multiple passengers
    code: "MountInfo mountInfo;\n// Assume mountInfo is populated with valid mount\
      \ data\nbool isMultiPassenger = sMountMgr->IsMultiPassengerMount(mountInfo);\n\
      if (isMultiPassenger)\n{\n    // Handle logic for multi-passenger mount\n  \
      \  printf(\"This mount supports multiple passengers.\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle logic for single passenger mount\n    printf(\"This mount only\
      \ supports a single passenger.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal mount flags and properties defined in the
    game's database or configuration files. It should be used primarily during mount
    validation or UI display logic to determine appropriate interaction behavior.
