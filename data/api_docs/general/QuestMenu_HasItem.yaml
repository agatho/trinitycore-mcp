documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest item is present in the quest menu for the specified quest
    ID.
  description: The HasItem method determines whether a specific quest item is available
    within the player's quest menu for a given quest ID. This functionality is commonly
    used during quest interaction to verify if certain items are required or available
    as part of the quest objectives. The method typically checks internal quest menu
    data structures to confirm the presence of an associated item related to the specified
    quest. It does not modify any state but rather provides a read-only check for
    quest item availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest has an associated item in the quest
    menu; otherwise, returns false. This indicates whether the quest menu contains
    an item entry related to the provided quest ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Item Check
    code: "if (player->GetPlayer()->GetQuestMenu().HasItem(12345)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ item is available in the menu\n    player->SendQuestUpdateAddItem(12345, 1);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's current quest menu state and should
    be called after the quest menu has been populated with relevant quest data. It
    does not perform any database queries or network operations; instead, it checks
    cached data within the client-side quest menu structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual quest in the game's database. Passing invalid quest IDs may result
    in unexpected behavior or false negatives if the internal data structures are
    not properly initialized.
