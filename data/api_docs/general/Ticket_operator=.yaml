  brief: Moves a ticket object to another ticket object, transferring ownership of
    its resources.
  description: The move assignment operator for the Ticket class transfers all resources
    from the source ticket (rvalue reference) to the current ticket object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where you want to efficiently transfer ownership
    of a ticket's data without performing deep copies. The source ticket will be left
    in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's
    ticketing system, this method allows for efficient handling of ticket objects
    when they are being reassigned or reprocessed, such as during ticket resolution
    or forwarding operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current Ticket object after the move assignment has
    been completed. This enables chaining of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'Ticket ticket1;

      Ticket ticket2 = std::move(ticket1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      ticket1 = std::move(ticket2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<Ticket> tickets;

      Ticket newTicket;

      tickets.push_back(std::move(newTicket)); // Efficiently moves ticket into vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented as a move operation that transfers
    internal pointers or handles rather than copying data. It's important to note
    that after a move assignment, the source object should not be used in any way
    that would access its former data, as it will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state.
  warnings: Using the move assignment operator on an already moved-from object can
    lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure that you're not using the source object
    after performing a move operation. Additionally, if the Ticket class manages resources
    like database connections or file handles, those resources will be transferred
    to the target object and should be properly managed.
