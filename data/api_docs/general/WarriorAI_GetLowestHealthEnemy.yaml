  class: WarriorAI
  method: GetLowestHealthEnemy
  signature: ::Unit * WarriorAI::GetLowestHealthEnemy()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit with the lowest health among all enemies in the WarriorAI's
    threat list.
  description: The GetLowestHealthEnemy method identifies and returns the enemy Unit
    that currently has the least amount of health within the scope of the WarriorAI's
    current target selection. This function is typically used by warrior AI behavior
    to prioritize targeting the weakest enemy, which can be an effective strategy
    for maximizing damage output or managing threat distribution in combat scenarios.
    The method iterates through the AI's known enemies and selects the one with the
    lowest health value, returning a pointer to that Unit. If no valid enemies are
    present or if there is an error during evaluation, it returns nullptr.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ::Unit object representing the enemy with the lowest health
    in the AI's current threat list. Returns nullptr if no valid enemies exist or
    if an internal error occurs during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = warriorAI->GetLowestHealthEnemy();\nif (target != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform action on the weakest enemy\n    warriorAI->Attack(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Target Selection with Validation
    code: "Unit* lowestHealthEnemy = warriorAI->GetLowestHealthEnemy();\nif (lowestHealthEnemy\
      \ && lowestHealthEnemy->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Ensure the enemy is still alive\
      \ before targeting\n    if (warriorAI->CanAttack(lowestHealthEnemy))\n    {\n\
      \        warriorAI->SetCurrentTarget(lowestHealthEnemy);\n        warriorAI->DoMeleeAttack();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal threat list and may not reflect real-time
    changes in enemy health if the AI has not updated its target selection recently.
    It assumes that the AI is already aware of its enemies through standard threat
    management mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned Unit will remain the lowest health enemy
    after this call, as combat dynamics change rapidly. Always validate the returned
    pointer and ensure the unit is still a valid combatant before acting upon it.
