  class: AuraEvent
  method: AuraRemoved
  signature: AuraEvent AuraEvent::AuraRemoved(int target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuraEvent object representing the removal of an
    aura from a target.
  description: The AuraRemoved method constructs and initializes a new AuraEvent instance
    to signify that an aura has been removed from a specified target. This event is
    typically used within the TrinityCore framework to notify systems and scripts
    about aura removals, which can occur due to various game mechanics such as spell
    interruption, duration expiration, or manual removal via game commands or effects.
    The method encapsulates the necessary data to represent this event in the game's
    event system, allowing for proper handling of aura-related logic and interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The target entity (player or creature) from which the aura is being
      removed. This parameter identifies the specific unit affected by the aura removal.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose aura is being removed. This
      ID corresponds to the SpellEntry in the database and determines which aura effect
      is being processed.
  returns: Returns a newly created AuraEvent object that represents the removal of
    an aura from the specified target with the given spell ID. The returned object
    can be used to trigger further actions or events within the TrinityCore system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraEvent event = AuraEvent::AuraRemoved(12345, 7890);

      // This creates an event indicating that aura from spell ID 7890 was removed
      from target with GUID 12345.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Event System
    code: "void HandleSpellAuraRemove(Player* player, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    AuraEvent\
      \ event = AuraEvent::AuraRemoved(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), spellId);\n\
      \    // Process the event through the game's event handling system\n    sScriptMgr->OnAuraRemoved(event);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura management system and should
    be used in conjunction with proper event handling mechanisms. The returned AuraEvent
    object may contain additional metadata or context that can be accessed through
    other methods on the AuraEvent class. Ensure that the target GUID and spell ID
    are valid before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method outside of appropriate aura removal
    contexts, as incorrect usage might lead to inconsistent game state or unexpected
    behavior in aura-related systems. The target parameter must reference a valid
    entity in the world; otherwise, the event may not be processed correctly.
