  signature: void PhasingHandler::SendToPlayer(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sends phase information to a specific player.
  description: The SendToPlayer method is responsible for transmitting phase data
    to a targeted player within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that
    the player's client is updated with the current phase state, allowing them to
    see or interact with objects and areas that are relevant to their active phase.
    It plays a crucial role in World of Warcraft's phasing system, which enables dynamic
    world content visibility based on quests, events, or other game mechanics. The
    method typically gets invoked when a player enters a new phase or when phase changes
    occur in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will receive the phase information.
      This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to an existing player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PhasingHandler::SendToPlayer(player);

      // Sends current phase data to the specified player.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Phase Change Handler
    code: "void HandlePhaseChange(Player* player, uint32 newPhaseId)\n{\n    // Update\
      \ internal phase state\n    player->SetPhaseMask(newPhaseId, true);\n    \n\
      \    // Notify the player of the change\n    PhasingHandler::SendToPlayer(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely constructs and sends a packet to the client containing
    phase-related data. It is important that the player object passed in is valid
    and currently connected to ensure successful transmission of the phase update.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will result in undefined
    behavior or a crash. Always verify that the player exists and is valid before
    calling this method.
