  class: ItemScript
  method: ItemScript
  signature: void ItemScript::ItemScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ItemScript with a specified name for use in World of Warcraft
    custom item handling.
  description: The ItemScript constructor initializes a new item script instance with
    the provided name. This method is used to register custom behavior for items within
    the TrinityCore framework. The name parameter serves as a unique identifier for
    the script, allowing the game server to associate specific logic with particular
    items. During initialization, the script registers itself with the item system,
    enabling hook functions such as OnUse, OnQuestAccept, and others to be triggered
    when players interact with items that match this script's name. This constructor
    is typically called during server startup or module loading to ensure all custom
    item behaviors are properly registered before gameplay begins.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique identifier for this
      item script. This name must be globally unique within the server's item script
      registry and is used to match against item templates during gameplay.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ItemScript Initialization
    code: "class GoldCoinScript : public ItemScript\n{\npublic:\n    GoldCoinScript()\
      \ : ItemScript(\"item_gold_coin\") {}\n    \n    bool OnUse(Player* player,\
      \ Item* item, const SpellCastTargets& targets) override\n    {\n        // Custom\
      \ logic for gold coin usage\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: ItemScript with Complex Name
    code: "class EnchantedSwordScript : public ItemScript\n{\npublic:\n    EnchantedSwordScript()\
      \ : ItemScript(\"weapon_enchanted_sword_001\") {}\n    \n    bool OnUse(Player*\
      \ player, Item* item, const SpellCastTargets& targets) override\n    {\n   \
      \     // Implementation for enchanted sword\n        return false;\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: The name parameter must be unique across all registered scripts to prevent
    conflicts. ItemScript constructors are typically called during static initialization
    or module loading phases. The script name is used internally by the TrinityCore
    item system to route item interactions to the appropriate handler functions.
  warnings: Using duplicate names for ItemScript instances will cause registration
    conflicts and may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all item script names
    are globally unique and follow naming conventions consistent with your server's
    coding standards.
