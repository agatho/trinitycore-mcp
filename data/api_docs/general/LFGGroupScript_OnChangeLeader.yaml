  class: LFGGroupScript
  method: OnChangeLeader
  signature: void LFGGroupScript::OnChangeLeader(Group * group, int newLeaderGuid,
    int oldLeaderGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Called when the leader of a LFG group changes, allowing scripts to respond
    to leadership transitions.
  description: The OnChangeLeader method is invoked whenever the leader of a Looking
    For Group (LFG) group is updated. This event occurs during group management operations
    such as player disbanding, kicking, or manual leadership transfers. The method
    provides access to both the old and new leader's GUIDs, enabling scripts to perform
    actions like updating permissions, notifying players, or synchronizing group state.
    It is part of the LFGGroupScript class which allows custom behavior in response
    to LFG group events.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose leader has changed. This represents
      the LFG group instance.
  - name: newLeaderGuid
    description: The GUID of the player who is now the group leader. This value is
      valid and non-zero.
  - name: oldLeaderGuid
    description: The GUID of the player who was previously the group leader. This
      value may be zero if the previous leader was invalid or not set.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Leader Change Handler
    code: "class MyLFGScript : public LFGGroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnChangeLeader(Group*\
      \ group, uint32 newLeaderGuid, uint32 oldLeaderGuid) override\n    {\n     \
      \   // Log the change\n        sLog->outString(\"LFG Group %u leader changed\
      \ from %u to %u\", group->GetGUIDLow(), oldLeaderGuid, newLeaderGuid);\n   \
      \     \n        // Perform any necessary actions here\n        // e.g., update\
      \ permissions, send notifications, etc.\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called from within the core group management system and should
    not be used to modify the group structure directly. It's intended for observing
    changes rather than altering them.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the group or its members inside this handler,
    as doing so might lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method is designed
    for observation only.
