  class: Creature
  method: SetTapList
  signature: void Creature::SetTapList(int tapList)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the tap list for the creature, determining which players can attack
    and receive loot from it.
  description: The SetTapList method configures the creature's tap list, which controls
    the set of players who can engage in combat with the creature and receive loot
    from it. This method is crucial for managing creature behavior in World of Warcraft's
    game mechanics, particularly when dealing with creature loot systems and player
    engagement. The tap list determines whether a player can attack the creature or
    not, and affects how the creature responds to player actions. This method typically
    involves setting up the creature's interaction with players based on their relationship
    to the creature.
  parameters:
  - name: tapList
    description: An integer representing the tap list value that determines which
      players can attack and loot the creature. This value controls the creature's
      engagement behavior and loot distribution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Tap List for a Creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetTapList(10);

      // This sets the tap list to 10, allowing players with specific relationship
      to attack and loot the creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature management
    methods. It's important to note that the tap list value affects how the creature
    interacts with players and can influence game balance. The method may be called
    during creature initialization or when setting up creature behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to creatures not responding properly
    to player attacks, potentially causing gameplay issues. Care should be taken when
    setting tap lists to ensure proper player engagement and loot distribution.
