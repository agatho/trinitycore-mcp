documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the focus target for the player's group
  description: The SelectGroupFocusTarget method determines and retrieves the appropriate
    focus target for a player's group. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes where group focus targeting is required, such as in raid encounters
    or group quests. The selection process considers various factors including target
    validity, threat levels, and group composition. It returns a SelectionResult which
    indicates whether the selection was successful and provides access to the selected
    target if available.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SelectionResult object that contains information about the success of
    the selection operation and references to the selected focus target when applicable.
    The result may indicate failure if no valid focus target exists in the group or
    if selection criteria are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "SelectionResult result = selector.SelectGroupFocusTarget();\nif (result.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    Unit* target = result.GetTarget();\n    // Proceed with attack or spell\
      \ targeting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within the TrinityCore AI system for group-based
    targeting decisions. The selection logic may vary depending on the current encounter
    type and group configuration. Performance considerations are minimal as this is
    a lightweight selection operation.
