  signature: void MountManager::SetAutomationProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const MountAutomationProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the mount automation profile for a specified player.
  description: The SetAutomationProfile method assigns a MountAutomationProfile to
    a player identified by their GUID. This profile defines how the player's mount
    automation behavior should function, including rules for when and how mounts are
    automatically used or dismissed. The method is typically invoked during player
    login or configuration changes to ensure that the automation system reflects the
    player's current preferences. It updates internal state within the MountManager
    without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose mount automation
      profile is being set. Must be a valid player GUID in the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: A constant reference to a MountAutomationProfile object containing
      the automation rules and settings for the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Mount Automation Profile
    code: 'MountAutomationProfile profile;

      profile.autoMount = true;

      profile.autoDismount = false;

      MountManager::SetAutomationProfile(12345, profile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal player state and should be called only when
    necessary to avoid unnecessary overhead. The MountManager is expected to handle
    persistence of the profile data across sessions if required.
