documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of free primary professions a player can have.
  description: This method configures the player's ability to learn primary professions
    without consuming their profession slots. It allows players to have a specified
    number of free primary professions, which means they can learn additional professions
    beyond their normal limits without requiring additional skill points or resources.
    This functionality is particularly useful for developers who want to create custom
    game mechanics or modify player progression behavior.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player-related methods
    that handle profession management. The value passed should be within reasonable
    limits as defined by game mechanics, and excessive values may cause issues with
    game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay or unexpected
    behavior in player progression systems. Care must be taken when setting high values
    to avoid exploits.
