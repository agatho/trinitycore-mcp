documentation:
  brief: Loads guild data from the database into memory
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves all relevant guild information from
    the database and populates the Guild object's internal data structures. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when a guild needs to be initialized
    in memory. It performs database queries to fetch guild details, members, ranks,
    and other associated data. The method ensures that all guild-related data is synchronized
    with the database state before the guild becomes active in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the guild data was successfully loaded from the database,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a database error
    or that the guild does not exist in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Loading
    code: "Guild* guild = new Guild();\nif (guild->LoadFromDB()) {\n    // Guild loaded\
      \ successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Guild loaded successfully\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle load failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load guild from\
      \ database\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Guild object is in an uninitialized
    state. It's typically invoked during server initialization or when a player attempts
    to access a guild that isn't currently loaded in memory. The method performs multiple
    database queries and may impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Calling LoadFromDB on a Guild object that is already populated with data
    will likely cause data corruption or inconsistent state. Always ensure the Guild
    object is clean before calling this method. This method assumes the database connection
    is valid and accessible.
