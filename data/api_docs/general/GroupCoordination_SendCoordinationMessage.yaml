documentation:
  brief: Sends a coordination message to a specified group member
  description: The SendCoordinationMessage method is used to transmit a textual message
    to a specific member within a group. This functionality is typically employed
    in group-based gameplay scenarios such as raid coordination, instance management,
    or team communication during questing activities. The method takes a message string
    and a target member identifier, ensuring that the message is delivered only to
    the intended recipient. It's designed to facilitate structured communication between
    players within the same group context.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: The coordination message to be sent as a string. This can contain
      any valid text content including formatting characters, but should be kept within
      reasonable length limits for network efficiency.
  - name: targetMember
    description: The unique identifier of the group member who will receive the message.
      This is typically a player GUID or similar unique identifier used to distinguish
      between group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send Coordination Message to Group Member
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coordination = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination();

      coordination->SendCoordinationMessage("Prepare for boss fight!", playerGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group coordination system and relies on proper
    group membership validation. The target member must be a valid group member, otherwise
    the message may not be delivered or could result in an error condition.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetMember parameter refers to an actual group member
    to avoid sending messages to invalid recipients. Excessive use of this method
    can impact network performance if not properly throttled.
