  class: AuctionHouseObject
  method: CreateCommodityQuote
  signature: const CommodityQuote * AuctionHouseObject::CreateCommodityQuote(const
    Player * player, uint32 itemId, uint32 quantity)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a commodity quote for the specified item and quantity.
  description: The CreateCommodityQuote method generates a CommodityQuote object that
    represents a quoted price for a specific commodity item in the auction house system.
    This method is typically used when a player attempts to list an item for sale
    or check the current market value of a commodity. The returned quote contains
    pricing information and metadata related to the commodity, which can be used for
    auction creation or valuation purposes. The method requires a valid player reference
    and a valid item identifier with a specified quantity.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object requesting the commodity quote. Must
      be a valid player instance.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which the quote is being created.
      Must correspond to a valid commodity item in the game database.
  - name: quantity
    description: The quantity of the item for which the quote is generated. Must be
      a positive integer representing the number of items.
  returns: A pointer to a const CommodityQuote object containing the pricing and metadata
    for the specified commodity. Returns nullptr if the operation fails due to invalid
    parameters or missing data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const CommodityQuote* quote = auctionHouse->CreateCommodityQuote(player,\
      \ 12345, 10);\nif (quote)\n{\n    // Use the quote for auction creation\n  \
      \  uint32 price = quote->GetPrice();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "const CommodityQuote* quote = auctionHouse->CreateCommodityQuote(player,\
      \ 99999, 5);\nif (!quote)\n{\n    // Handle invalid item or quantity\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Invalid commodity for auction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally validates the provided item ID and quantity against
    the game's commodity database. It may perform additional checks such as item type
    verification and player permissions. The returned CommodityQuote object is managed
    by the AuctionHouseObject and should not be deleted manually.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the itemId corresponds to an actual commodity item in the database; otherwise,
    the method may return nullptr without error reporting.
