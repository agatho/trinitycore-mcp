  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::IsSpellReady(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified spell is ready for use within the combat specialization.
  description: The IsSpellReady method determines whether a given spell is currently
    available for casting based on its cooldown status and other combat-related restrictions.
    This method is typically used in combat specialization logic to ensure that abilities
    are only executed when they meet the necessary conditions for activation. The
    check includes verifying that the spell is not on cooldown, meets any resource
    requirements (such as mana or energy), and satisfies any specialization-specific
    constraints. It serves as a core utility for AI decision-making in player and
    NPC combat behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is ready to be cast, meaning it is
    not on cooldown and all prerequisites are met; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsSpellReady(12345)) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 12345, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat AI
    code: "void CombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (IsSpellReady(98765)) {\n\
      \        DoCastVictim(98765);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any spell validation beyond cooldown and specialization
    readiness. It assumes that the spell ID passed is valid for the current combat
    specialization context. The implementation may vary depending on the specific
    subclass of CombatSpecializationBase.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method to determine if a spell can be cast;
    additional checks such as target validity, line of sight, and spell-specific conditions
    should also be performed before casting.
