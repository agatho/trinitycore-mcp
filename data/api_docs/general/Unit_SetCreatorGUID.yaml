  class: Unit
  method: SetCreatorGUID
  signature: void Unit::SetCreatorGUID(int creator)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the unit's creator.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the unit's creator,
    which is typically used in World of Warcraft to track the origin of creatures
    or objects. The GUID represents the entity that created the unit, such as a player,
    NPC, or other game object. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    ownership and tracking relationships within the game world. It ensures that the
    unit correctly references its creator's identity, particularly when dealing with
    summoned creatures or objects.
  parameters:
  - name: creator
    description: The GUID of the entity that created the unit. This parameter should
      be a valid GUID representing a player, NPC, or other game object in the World
      of Warcraft environment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetCreatorGUID(12345);

      // Sets the creator GUID to 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with player reference
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      Player* player = new Player();

      unit->SetCreatorGUID(player->GetGUID());

      // Sets the creator GUID to the player''s GUID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other unit-related methods
    to maintain accurate ownership tracking. It should be called before any gameplay
    mechanics that rely on the creator's identity are processed. Performance considerations
    include ensuring that the GUID passed is valid and not null, as invalid GUIDs
    can cause runtime errors.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect ownership tracking in
    game mechanics. Care must be taken to ensure that the creator GUID is valid and
    corresponds to an actual entity in the game world. Using invalid or null GUIDs
    can result in undefined behavior or crashes.
