  method: Update
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the dynamic quest system state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of dynamic quests within the TrinityCore world. It handles quest progression,
    objective tracking, and any time-based quest mechanics that require periodic updates.
    This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals to
    ensure that quest states remain synchronized with the passage of in-game time.
    The method processes all active dynamic quests and applies necessary updates such
    as timer decrements, condition checks, and state transitions. It ensures that
    quest data remains consistent and reflects the current game state accurately.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    dynamicQuestSystem.Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void World::UpdateWorld()\n{\n    static uint32 updateTimer = 0;\n    updateTimer\
      \ += diff;\n    \n    if (updateTimer >= 1000) // Update every second\n    {\n\
      \        dynamicQuestSystem.Update(updateTimer);\n        updateTimer = 0;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop to
    maintain quest state consistency. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds
    elapsed since last update, which is crucial for accurate time-based quest mechanics.
    Performance considerations include avoiding heavy operations within this method
    as it may be called frequently.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from quest event handlers or other systems
    that might cause recursive updates. Ensure the dynamic quest system is properly
    initialized before calling Update to avoid undefined behavior.
