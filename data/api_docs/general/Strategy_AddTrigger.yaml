  class: Strategy
  method: AddTrigger
  signature: void Strategy::AddTrigger(std::shared_ptr<Trigger> trigger)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a trigger to the strategy for event handling and response execution.
  description: The AddTrigger method registers a Trigger object with the Strategy,
    enabling the strategy to respond to specific game events or conditions. Triggers
    are used in AI systems to define when certain actions should be executed. This
    method typically integrates the trigger into an internal collection or list managed
    by the Strategy class, allowing the AI system to evaluate and activate triggers
    based on game state changes. The added trigger will be processed during the strategy's
    execution cycle, potentially modifying behavior or initiating actions.
  parameters:
  - name: trigger
    description: A shared pointer to a Trigger object that defines the conditions
      under which an action should be executed. The trigger must be properly initialized
      and contain valid event criteria.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Addition
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<Trigger> myTrigger = std::make_shared<MyCustomTrigger>();

      strategy->AddTrigger(myTrigger);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Triggers
    code: 'strategy->AddTrigger(std::make_shared<AggroTrigger>());

      strategy->AddTrigger(std::make_shared<HealthTrigger>(50));

      strategy->AddTrigger(std::make_shared<SpellCastTrigger>(SPELL_FIREBALL));'
    language: cpp
  notes: Triggers added via this method are typically evaluated in the order they
    were added, though specific execution order may depend on internal strategy implementation.
    The Strategy class likely maintains a collection of triggers that are iterated
    through during AI decision-making cycles.
  warnings: Ensure that the Trigger object passed to AddTrigger is properly initialized
    and not null, as this could lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the AI system.
    Adding duplicate triggers may result in unexpected behavior depending on implementation
    details.
