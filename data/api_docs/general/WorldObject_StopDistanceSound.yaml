  signature: void WorldObject::StopDistanceSound(const Player * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Stops distance sound playback for a target player.
  description: This method halts any distance-based sound effects that are currently
    playing for the specified player. It is typically used in conjunction with distance-based
    sound mechanics to ensure proper audio synchronization when objects move or interact
    with players. The method operates on a per-player basis and does not affect other
    players or objects in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which the distance sound playback
      should be stopped. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Stop distance sound for player
    code: 'WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();

      Player* targetPlayer = new Player();

      obj->StopDistanceSound(targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely involves checking the current
    sound state of the player and stopping any active distance-based audio playback.
    Performance considerations: The operation should be lightweight as it only affects
    a single player''s audio state.'
  warnings: 'This method requires that the target parameter is valid and not null;
    otherwise, it may cause crashes or undefined behavior. Common mistake: Using an
    invalid pointer for the target player can lead to memory access violations.'
