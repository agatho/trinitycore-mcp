  signature: bool MarketAnalysis::IsMarketManipulated(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the market price for a specific item is manipulated or abnormal.
  description: The IsMarketManipulated method evaluates whether the current market
    price of a given item has been artificially altered or is significantly deviating
    from expected values. This function is typically used in auction house systems
    to detect potential cheating or exploitation by players. It analyzes recent transaction
    data, price trends, and other market indicators to determine if an item's price
    is suspicious. The method returns true if manipulation is detected, false otherwise.
    This check may be performed periodically or triggered by specific events such
    as price changes or large transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the market price for the specified item shows signs of
    manipulation or abnormal behavior; returns false if the price appears normal and
    within expected ranges.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (marketAnalysis->IsMarketManipulated(18730)) {\n    // Handle manipulated\
      \ item\n    sLog->outString(\"Item ID 18730 is being manipulated!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House
    code: "void AuctionHouseMgr::CheckForManipulatedItems() {\n    for (uint32 itemId\
      \ = 1; itemId < MAX_ITEM_ID; ++itemId) {\n        if (marketAnalysis->IsMarketManipulated(itemId))\
      \ {\n            // Log suspicious activity\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Potential market manipulation detected for item %u\", itemId);\n           \
      \ // Trigger anti-cheat measures\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on historical price data and may have performance
    implications when checking many items. It's recommended to cache results or perform
    checks selectively rather than scanning all items continuously. The exact algorithm
    for detecting manipulation is not specified but could involve statistical analysis,
    comparison with similar items, or deviation thresholds.
  warnings: Do not call this method excessively in tight loops as it may cause performance
    issues. The detection logic might produce false positives during normal market
    fluctuations, so results should be used cautiously in automated systems.
