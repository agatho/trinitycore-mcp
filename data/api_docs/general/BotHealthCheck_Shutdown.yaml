  brief: Stops and cleans up the bot health checking system
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all active bot health checks and performs
    necessary cleanup operations. This method ensures that all resources associated
    with the bot health monitoring system are properly released and that no further
    health checks are performed. It is typically called during server shutdown or
    when disabling the bot health checking functionality. The method does not take
    any parameters and does not return a value.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotHealthCheck* healthCheck = new BotHealthCheck();

      // ... perform operations ...

      healthCheck->Shutdown();

      delete healthCheck;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot health checking system is
    no longer needed. It is recommended to call Shutdown before deleting the BotHealthCheck
    instance to ensure proper cleanup of internal resources.
