  class: AreaTriggerAI
  method: SetGUID
  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::SetGUID(const int & guid, int32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of an area trigger AI object with an associated identifier.
  description: The SetGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to an AreaTriggerAI
    instance, allowing it to track and reference specific game objects or entities.
    This method is typically used during initialization or when linking the area trigger
    to a particular entity within the game world. The id parameter allows for categorization
    or identification of different types of triggers or associations. The GUID is
    essential for maintaining object references in TrinityCore's event-driven system,
    particularly when dealing with area triggers that interact with players, creatures,
    or other game objects.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object to be associated
      with this area trigger AI. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the
      object's identity in the world.
  - name: id
    description: An additional identifier used to categorize or distinguish different
      types of associations for the area trigger. This can be used to differentiate
      between various trigger behaviors or purposes within the same AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Initialization
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnInitialize()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Set the GUID of the area trigger to reference\
      \ a specific game object\n        SetGUID(12345, 1);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting GUID with Different ID Values for Behavior Differentiation
    code: "class CombatAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnEnterCombat() override\n    {\n        // Set different GUIDs based on combat\
      \ state or trigger type\n        if (IsPlayerInRadius())\n            SetGUID(player->GetGUID(),\
      \ 10); // Player-triggered\n        else\n            SetGUID(creature->GetGUID(),\
      \ 20); // Creature-triggered\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AreaTriggerAI class which handles AI behavior
    for area triggers in TrinityCore. It's commonly used in conjunction with other
    methods like GetGUID() or HasGUID() to manage trigger states and interactions.
    The GUID value should be a valid identifier from the game world, typically obtained
    through GameObject::GetGUID() or similar methods.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID being set is valid and corresponds to an existing
    object in the world; otherwise, subsequent operations using this GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid calling SetGUID with invalid or zero GUIDs
    unless explicitly intended for clearing references.
