documentation:
  brief: Handles the quest dialog interaction between a player and a quest giver NPC.
  description: The HandleQuestDialog method processes the interaction when a player
    interacts with a quest giver NPC to initiate or continue a quest. It manages the
    display of quest details, handles quest acceptance, and updates the player's quest
    state accordingly. This method is typically invoked when a player clicks on a
    quest-giving NPC or uses the quest interface to engage with available quests.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player
      character.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC or object that
      initiated the dialog.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the specific quest being interacted with.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Quest Dialog Handling
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 npcGuid = 12345;

      uint32 questId = 67890;

      QuestPickup::HandleQuestDialog(player, npcGuid, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore quest system to update
    quest status, send quest-related packets to the client, and manage quest state
    transitions. It is part of the core quest handling logic in the game engine.
