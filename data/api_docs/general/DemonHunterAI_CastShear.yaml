  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: CastShear
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::CastShear(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Shear ability on the specified target.
  description: The CastShear method executes the Demon Hunter's Shear ability, which
    is a melee attack that deals damage and applies a bleed effect. This method is
    typically called by the AI system when a Demon Hunter needs to engage an enemy
    in close combat. The ability has a short cooldown and is used primarily for dealing
    consistent damage while applying debuffs. The target parameter specifies which
    unit to cast Shear against, and the method handles all necessary checks such as
    line of sight, range, and target validity before executing the spell.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      within the AI's target list. This value should correspond to a valid unit in
      the current combat context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastShear
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastShear(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CastShear with target validation
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::DoCastShear()\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        if\
      \ (targetId > 0)\n        {\n            CastShear(&targetId);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Demon Hunter has sufficient resource (focus
    or fury) to cast Shear. It does not perform any resource checks itself, so it
    should be called only when appropriate. The target parameter must point to a valid
    unit; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Calling CastShear without verifying that the target is valid or within
    range can result in failed spell casts or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all
    preconditions for casting Shear are met before invoking this method.
