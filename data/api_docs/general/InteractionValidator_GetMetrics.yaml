  class: InteractionValidator
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: ValidationMetrics InteractionValidator::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the validation metrics collected by the interaction validator.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a copy of the ValidationMetrics object
    that contains aggregated statistics and performance data collected during interaction
    validation processes. This includes counts of successful and failed validations,
    timing information, and other diagnostic data relevant to the validator's operation.
    The returned metrics are immutable and represent a snapshot of the validator's
    state at the time of the call. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging,
    or reporting purposes to understand how effectively the interaction validator
    is performing its checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ValidationMetrics object containing collected validation statistics such
    as success/failure counts, timing data, and other diagnostic information. The
    returned object is a copy and will not reflect subsequent changes to the internal
    metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InteractionValidator validator;

      // ... perform some validations ...

      ValidationMetrics metrics = validator.GetMetrics();

      std::cout << "Successful validations: " << metrics.success_count << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Validation Performance
    code: "InteractionValidator validator;\n// ... run validation operations ...\n\
      ValidationMetrics metrics = validator.GetMetrics();\nif (metrics.failure_count\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Validation failures detected: \" << metrics.failure_count\
      \ << std::endl;\n}\nstd::cout << \"Average validation time: \" << metrics.avg_duration_ms\
      \ << \" ms\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ValidationMetrics object is a snapshot and does not update automatically.
    If real-time metrics are needed, the method should be called repeatedly. The method
    is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without locking concerns.
  warnings: The returned ValidationMetrics object is a copy, so modifications to it
    will not affect the internal state of the InteractionValidator. Be aware that
    frequent calls to this method may have performance implications if the metrics
    contain large amounts of data or are computed on-the-fly.
