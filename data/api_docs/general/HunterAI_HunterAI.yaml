  class: HunterAI
  method: HunterAI
  signature: void HunterAI::HunterAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a HunterAI instance with the specified player bot.
  description: The HunterAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence behavior
    for a hunter class player bot. This method sets up internal state and configurations
    necessary for the bot to function as a hunter in the game environment, including
    weapon handling, pet management, and ability usage patterns. The initialization
    process typically involves setting up AI decision-making parameters, threat assessment
    routines, and combat strategies specific to hunter gameplay mechanics such as
    trap placement, shot selection, and pet behavior control.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the hunter bot that this
      AI will control. Must not be null and should represent a valid player instance
      with hunter class characteristics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic HunterAI Initialization
    code: 'Player* myHunterBot = new Player();

      myHunterBot->SetClass(CLASS_HUNTER);

      HunterAI* hunterAI = new HunterAI(myHunterBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the creation or assignment of
    a bot to ensure proper AI behavior. The AI system relies on the player object's
    state and properties to make intelligent decisions about combat actions, targeting,
    and resource management.
