  class: Player
  method: SendMovieStart
  signature: void Player::SendMovieStart(uint32 movieId)
documentation:
  brief: Starts playback of a movie sequence for the player.
  description: The SendMovieStart method initiates playback of a specified movie sequence
    for the player, allowing the game to display cinematic cutscenes or movie sequences.
    This method is typically used during quest events, character creation, or other
    gameplay scenarios where cinematic content needs to be presented to the player.
    The movie ID parameter determines which specific movie sequence will be played,
    with valid values ranging from 0 to 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF). The method does not
    return any value and is intended for use in game events or quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: movieId
    description: The unique identifier of the movie sequence to be played. This value
      corresponds to a specific movie in the game's database, typically ranging from
      0 to 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF). A valid movie ID must exist in the game's movie
      database for the method to function properly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendMovieStart(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Event Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 movieId = 56789;

      player->SendMovieStart(movieId);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other cinematic-related
    methods and should be called when the player needs to experience a specific movie
    sequence. The method may not work if the movie ID does not exist in the game's
    database or if the player is not in a state where cinematic sequences can be displayed.
  warnings: The movie ID must be valid and correspond to an existing movie in the
    game database, otherwise the method will have no effect. This method should only
    be called during appropriate gameplay events, as calling it outside of such contexts
    may cause unexpected behavior or visual glitches.
