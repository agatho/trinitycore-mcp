documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown states for all arcane mage abilities and spells.
  description: The UpdateCooldownStates method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with all arcane mage abilities, spells, and talents.
    This method typically iterates through the mage's spellbook or ability list to
    check if any cooldowns have expired and updates their internal state accordingly.
    It ensures that abilities are properly reset and ready for use after their cooldown
    periods have completed. The method is commonly called during combat updates, periodic
    tick events, or when a new spell is cast to maintain accurate cooldown tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void ArcaneMageRefactored::OnCombatUpdate()\n{\n    // Update cooldown\
      \ states periodically during combat\n    UpdateCooldownStates();\n    // Other\
      \ combat logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: "void ArcaneMageRefactored::CastSpell(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    // Cast the\
      \ spell first\n    DoCast(spellId);\n    \n    // Then update cooldown states\
      \ to reflect new cooldowns\n    UpdateCooldownStates();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat or game tick updates
    to ensure accurate cooldown tracking. It may involve iterating through multiple
    spell entries and performing time-based calculations, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account for high-frequency calls.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    unnecessary performance overhead. Ensure that cooldown states are only updated
    when necessary rather than on every game tick to avoid redundant processing.
