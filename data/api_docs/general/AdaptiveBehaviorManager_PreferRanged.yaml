  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: PreferRanged
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::PreferRanged() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager prefers ranged combat behavior.
  description: The PreferRanged method evaluates and returns a boolean value indicating
    if the current adaptive behavior configuration favors ranged combat over melee
    engagement. This decision is typically based on factors such as the creature's
    current health, available threat levels, distance to target, and predefined AI
    rules within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. The method does not modify any internal
    state but provides a read-only assessment of the preferred combat style for the
    entity controlled by this behavior manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the adaptive behavior manager prefers ranged combat; otherwise
    returns false, indicating a preference for melee or hybrid combat styles.
  examples:
  - title: Check if AI prefers ranged combat
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.PreferRanged()) {\n    // Switch to ranged\
      \ attack logic\n    creature->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n    // Apply ranged-specific\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in custom AI scripts where dynamic combat style
    switching is required. It may be called frequently during combat updates, so performance
    should be considered when implementing complex logic within this check.
