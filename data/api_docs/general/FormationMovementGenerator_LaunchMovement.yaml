  class: FormationMovementGenerator
  method: LaunchMovement
  signature: void FormationMovementGenerator::LaunchMovement(Creature * owner, int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates formation movement for a creature using the specified target.
  description: The LaunchMovement method starts the formation movement behavior for
    a given creature, instructing it to move in a specific formation relative to a
    target unit. This method is typically used in AI logic to coordinate group movement
    patterns, such as when creatures need to follow a leader or maintain a tactical
    formation during combat. The method sets up the necessary movement generators
    and parameters required for the creature to begin moving according to the formation
    rules defined by the system.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will begin the formation movement.
      This is the unit that will execute the movement behavior.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      within the formation system. This value determines which entity the creature
      should position itself relative to in the formation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Movement Launch
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...;

      int targetId = 1;

      formationMovementGenerator->LaunchMovement(myCreature, &targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the FormationMovementGenerator has been properly
    initialized and configured with appropriate formation data. It is expected that
    the target unit referenced by 'target' is valid and exists within the game world
    when this method is called.
  warnings: Calling LaunchMovement without ensuring the target unit is valid may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. The method does not perform validation on the
    target parameter, so developers must ensure proper initialization before calling.
