  signature: void BotThreatManager::UpdateRoleBasedThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Updates threat values for bot characters based on their assigned roles within
    the group.
  description: The UpdateRoleBasedThreat method recalculates and applies appropriate
    threat levels to bot characters according to their designated roles such as tank,
    healer, or damage dealer. This ensures that bots behave realistically in combat
    scenarios by maintaining proper aggro distribution and role-specific threat management.
    The method typically runs during combat updates and adjusts threat values dynamically
    based on the bot's current actions, target selection, and group composition. It
    is an essential part of the AI behavior system for maintaining balanced gameplay
    when bots are involved in encounters.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void BotCombatAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    _threatManager.UpdateRoleBasedThreat();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure accurate
    threat management. It relies on the bot's current role assignment and may interact
    with other AI systems such as target selection and spell casting. The implementation
    likely involves checking each bot's role, evaluating their current threat contribution,
    and adjusting threat values accordingly.
