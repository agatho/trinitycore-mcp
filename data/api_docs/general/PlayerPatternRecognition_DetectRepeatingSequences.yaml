  brief: Analyzes player input patterns to detect repeating sequences in gameplay
    behavior
  description: The DetectRepeatingSequences method performs pattern recognition on
    player input data to identify recurring sequences or behaviors within the player's
    gameplay actions. This method is typically used in conjunction with anti-cheat
    systems or behavioral analysis modules to detect automated or repetitive play
    patterns that may indicate botting or cheating activity. The method processes
    the sampled input data and returns a numerical representation of detected sequence
    repetition strength or frequency. It operates on the principle of analyzing temporal
    patterns in player actions such as movement, casting, or interaction sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the strength or count of detected
    repeating sequences. A higher positive value indicates stronger evidence of repetitive
    patterns, while zero typically means no significant repetition was detected. Negative
    values may indicate error conditions or invalid input processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for detecting repetitive gameplay patterns
    code: "int sequenceStrength = playerPatternRecognition.DetectRepeatingSequences();\n\
      if (sequenceStrength > 10) {\n    // Potential botting behavior detected\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"High repetition detected: %d\", sequenceStrength);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely computationally intensive as it requires analyzing
    temporal sequences of player inputs. It may be called periodically during gameplay
    to monitor for suspicious patterns without significantly impacting performance.
    The exact algorithmic approach for pattern detection is implementation-specific
    and may involve statistical analysis or machine learning techniques.
  warnings: The method should not be used as the sole indicator for banning players,
    as legitimate gameplay can sometimes exhibit repetitive patterns. Results should
    be combined with other anti-cheat measures and human review for accurate detection
    of cheating behavior.
