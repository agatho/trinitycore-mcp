documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the result of a specified experiment from the learning analytics
    system
  description: The GetExperimentResult method fetches the outcome data for a specific
    experiment identified by its name. This method is part of the LearningAnalytics
    class which manages experimental data within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    ExperimentResult object contains statistical analysis, performance metrics, and
    other relevant data about the experiment's execution. The method performs a lookup
    in an internal data structure containing all registered experiments and returns
    their corresponding results. This functionality is typically used for monitoring
    game balance, player behavior analysis, or evaluating new features before deployment.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ExperimentResult object containing the complete result data of the specified
    experiment. Returns an empty or default-initialized ExperimentResult if no experiment
    with the given name exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ExperimentResult result = learningAnalytics.GetExperimentResult(\"player_movement_speed_analysis\"\
      );\nif (!result.IsEmpty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Experiment success rate: \"\
      \ << result.GetSuccessRate() << \"%\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "ExperimentResult result = learningAnalytics.GetExperimentResult(\"non_existent_experiment\"\
      );\nif (result.IsEmpty()) {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"learning\", \"Experiment 'non_existent_experiment'\
      \ not found in analytics system\");\n} else {\n    // Process valid experiment\
      \ result\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any game thread. The internal
    experiment data structure is assumed to be protected by appropriate locking mechanisms.
    Performance is optimized through hash-based lookup for experiment names, making
    repeated calls efficient.
  warnings: The method does not validate the existence of the experiment before attempting
    retrieval. It's recommended to check if the returned ExperimentResult is valid
    (not empty) before accessing its data members to avoid potential undefined behavior.
