  class: DemonologyWarlockRefactored
  method: ConsumeSoulShard
  signature: void DemonologyWarlockRefactored::ConsumeSoulShard(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified number of soul shards from the warlock's resource
    pool.
  description: The ConsumeSoulShard method reduces the current count of soul shards
    available to a demonology warlock by the provided amount. This method is typically
    invoked when casting spells or abilities that require soul shards as a resource,
    such as Soul Fire or Shadow Bolt. The operation ensures that the warlock has sufficient
    soul shards before consuming them, and will not allow negative shard counts. It
    is an integral part of managing the warlock's resource system in demonology specialization.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of soul shards to consume from the warlock's resource
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer representing valid shard count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: warlock->ConsumeSoulShard(1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Multiple Soul Shards
    code: 'uint32 shardsToConsume = 3;

      warlock->ConsumeSoulShard(shardsToConsume);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the warlock actually has enough soul
    shards available to avoid unexpected behavior. The implementation likely includes
    checks to prevent underflow of the internal shard counter.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that sufficient soul shards are
    available may result in undefined behavior or incorrect resource management. Always
    validate resource availability before calling this method.
