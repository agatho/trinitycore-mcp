  method: SetArenaTeamIdInvited
  signature: void Player::SetArenaTeamIdInvited(uint32 ArenaTeamId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the arena team ID that a player was invited to.
  description: This method assigns an arena team ID to a player, indicating which
    specific arena team they were invited to. The method is typically used during
    arena team invitation processes and affects the player's internal state regarding
    arena team membership. It does not directly modify the player's actual team membership
    but rather sets the ID that will be used for future team joining operations. This
    method is part of the broader arena team management system in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: ArenaTeamId
    description: The unique identifier of the arena team that the player was invited
      to. This ID corresponds to a specific arena team in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Arena Team Invitation ID
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetArenaTeamIdInvited(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Arena Team ID in a Matchmaking Context
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 teamId = 54321;

      player->SetArenaTeamIdInvited(teamId);

      // Player now has the team ID set for future team joining

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during arena team invitation processes and
    should be used in conjunction with other methods that handle team joining. The
    method does not immediately join the player to the team; it only sets the ID that
    will be used when the player accepts the invitation.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for team joining operations as
    it does not actually join the player to the team. Care must be taken to ensure
    proper sequence of operations when handling arena team invitations and joins.
