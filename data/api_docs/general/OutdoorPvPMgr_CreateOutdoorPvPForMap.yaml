  signature: void OutdoorPvPMgr::CreateOutdoorPvPForMap(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and registers Outdoor PvP objects for the specified map
  description: The CreateOutdoorPvPForMap method is responsible for creating and setting
    up all Outdoor PvP (Player vs Player) systems associated with a given map. This
    method iterates through the registered OutdoorPvP scripts and initializes them
    for the specific map instance, ensuring that PvP zones, capture points, and related
    game mechanics are properly configured. It typically gets called during map loading
    or initialization phases to ensure that all Outdoor PvP functionality is available
    for players interacting with that particular map.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object for which Outdoor PvP systems should be
      created and initialized. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid map instance within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Map Initialization
    code: "void Map::LoadMapAndObjects()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code\
      \ ...\n    sOutdoorPvPMgr->CreateOutdoorPvPForMap(this);\n    // ... continue\
      \ with map loading ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Custom Outdoor PvP Module
    code: "class MyOutdoorPvPModule : public OutdoorPvP\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeForMap(Map*\
      \ map)\n    {\n        // Perform custom initialization logic\n        sOutdoorPvPMgr->CreateOutdoorPvPForMap(map);\n\
      \        // Register additional event handlers or data structures\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core during map loading,
    but may also be called manually in custom modules. It's important to ensure that
    all OutdoorPvP scripts are registered before this method is called, otherwise
    no Outdoor PvP systems will be initialized for the map.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null map pointer will likely result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the map parameter refers to a valid, loaded
    map instance before calling this function.
