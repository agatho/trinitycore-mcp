documentation:
  brief: Sends the guild's event log to the specified session.
  description: The SendEventLog method retrieves and transmits the complete event
    log of a guild to a connected WorldSession. This functionality is used to display
    guild activity history such as member joins, leaves, promotions, demotions, and
    other significant events. The method ensures that only players with appropriate
    permissions can view the event log by checking session access rights before sending
    data. It typically gets invoked when a player opens the guild management interface
    or requests historical records through the client UI.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Management
    code: "void HandleGuildEventLog(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    if (Player* player\
      \ = session->GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Guild* guild = player->GetGuild())\n\
      \        {\n            guild->SendEventLog(session);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally constructs a packet containing all guild events and
    sends it to the client. It may involve database queries to fetch recent events,
    so performance could be impacted for large guilds with extensive histories. The
    method assumes that the session is valid and properly authenticated.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the session's player belongs
    to a guild or has sufficient permissions might lead to undefined behavior or data
    exposure. Ensure proper access control checks are performed before invoking this
    function.
