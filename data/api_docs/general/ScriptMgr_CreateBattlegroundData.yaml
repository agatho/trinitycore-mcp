    * map)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a BattlegroundScript instance for the specified battleground
    map.
  description: The CreateBattlegroundData method is responsible for instantiating
    a BattlegroundScript object that corresponds to the provided battleground map.
    This method serves as a factory function within the ScriptMgr class, enabling
    dynamic creation of battleground-specific scripts based on the map type. The returned
    script instance typically contains all necessary game logic and state management
    for handling battleground events, scoring, and player interactions. It is commonly
    used during battleground initialization and setup phases to ensure proper scripting
    behavior for each unique battleground type.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a BattlegroundScript object that manages the scripting behavior
    for the specified battleground map. Returns nullptr if the battleground type is
    not supported or if script creation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Initialization
    code: "BattlegroundMap* bgMap = ...; // Get battleground map\nBattlegroundScript*\
      \ bgScript = sScriptMgr->CreateBattlegroundData(bgMap);\nif (bgScript)\n{\n\
      \    // Initialize the battleground with its script\n    bgScript->Initialize();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    battleground creation. Developers should not directly invoke this method unless
    implementing custom battleground logic. The returned BattlegroundScript object
    must be properly managed to prevent memory leaks. The method relies on internal
    script registration and mapping mechanisms that associate battleground types with
    their corresponding script implementations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null map pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure the map parameter is valid and represents
    a supported battleground type before calling this method. Improper handling of
    the returned script pointer may lead to memory corruption or resource leaks.
