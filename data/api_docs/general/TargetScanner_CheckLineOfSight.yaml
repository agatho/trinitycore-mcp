  signature: bool TargetScanner::CheckLineOfSight(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if there is a clear line of sight between the scanner's unit and the
    specified target.
  description: The CheckLineOfSight method determines whether a direct visual path
    exists from the scanning unit to the target unit, taking into account obstacles
    such as walls, terrain, or other entities that may block the line of sight. This
    is commonly used in AI behavior, spell casting, and targeting logic within TrinityCore's
    game engine. The method performs a raycast check from the scanner's position to
    the target's position, evaluating whether any solid objects or barriers interrupt
    the straight-line path between them. It returns true if no obstructions are found,
    indicating that the target is visible to the scanner, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there is a clear line of sight from the scanner's unit
    to the target unit; returns false if any object or terrain blocks the view between
    them.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line of Sight Check
    code: "if (scanner.CheckLineOfSight(target)) {\n    // Target is visible, proceed\
      \ with attack or spell\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Target is obstructed, move closer or find another approach\n\
      \    unit->MoveTowards(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses internal collision detection and raycasting routines optimized
    for performance in the TrinityCore environment. It assumes that both the scanner
    and target units have valid positions and are within the same map instance.
  warnings: Do not assume that a successful line of sight check guarantees that the
    target is within attack range or that the spell will successfully hit. Additional
    distance checks and targeting validation should be performed depending on the
    specific use case.
