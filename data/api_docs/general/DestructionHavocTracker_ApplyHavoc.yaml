  class: DestructionHavocTracker
  method: ApplyHavoc
  signature: void DestructionHavocTracker::ApplyHavoc(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Applies havoc effects to a target specified by GUID within the Destruction
    Havoc Tracker system.
  description: The ApplyHavoc method is responsible for triggering havoc mechanics
    on a specific target identified by its global unique identifier (GUID). This method
    likely integrates with TrinityCore's combat and spell systems to apply damage,
    debuffs, or other havoc-related effects. It operates within the context of destruction-based
    abilities, typically used in classes such as Warlocks or other spellcasters who
    utilize havoc mechanics. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    state related to the target's condition or the caster's ability usage.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the target to apply havoc effects
      to. This value must correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player within
      the TrinityCore world instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Havoc Application
    code: 'DestructionHavocTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyHavoc(12345); // Applies havoc to target with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Havoc Application in Combat Context
    code: "if (player->GetTarget())\n{\n    DestructionHavocTracker tracker;\n   \
      \ tracker.ApplyHavoc(player->GetTarget()->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target GUID is valid and exists in the current
    world context. It may internally check for validity or throw exceptions if invalid.
    The actual havoc effects are likely applied through other subsystems like spell
    casting, damage handling, or aura management.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing entity before
    calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior or crashes may occur. This
    function should only be called during active combat or when appropriate game state
    conditions are met.
