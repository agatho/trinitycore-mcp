documentation:
  brief: Builds and updates item values with flag for target player
  description: This method constructs the update data for an item's attributes, including
    its stats, enchantments, and other properties, using a specified flag. It is designed
    to be called during item updates in World of Warcraft, particularly when sending
    item information to players. The method ensures that all relevant item data is
    properly formatted and sent to the target player's client, allowing for accurate
    display of item properties in the game interface.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the update data will be stored.
      This array contains the values that represent item attributes such as stats,
      enchantments, and other properties.
  - name: flags
    description: An integer flag that determines which item attributes are included
      in the update. The flag specifies the type of data being updated, such as whether
      to include stat values, enchantment information, or other item-specific properties.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to a Player object representing the target player receiving
      the update. This parameter ensures that the update is properly formatted for
      the specific player's client, allowing for correct display of item properties
      in the game interface.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item item;

      int data[10];

      int flags = 1;

      Player* target_player = nullptr;

      item.BuildValuesUpdateWithFlag(data, flags, target_player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item update methods
    and should be called when an item's properties change. It is important to ensure
    that the data array is properly initialized before calling this method, as it
    may cause memory issues if not handled correctly.
  warnings: The method requires careful handling of the data array and flag values,
    as improper use can lead to incorrect updates or memory corruption. Additionally,
    this method should only be called when the item is being updated for a specific
    player, not in general.
