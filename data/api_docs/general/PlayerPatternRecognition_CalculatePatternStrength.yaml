documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the strength of a given pattern signature for the
    player.
  description: The CalculatePatternStrength method evaluates the strength or significance
    of a provided pattern signature within the context of the player's recognition
    capabilities. This method is typically used in gameplay mechanics that involve
    pattern matching, such as identifying unique behaviors, detecting cheating patterns,
    or analyzing player actions. The returned float value represents a normalized
    strength metric, where higher values indicate stronger or more significant patterns.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is designed to be a read-only
    operation on the player's pattern recognition data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated strength of the provided
    pattern signature. Values typically range from 0.0 (indicating no pattern strength
    or invalid input) to 1.0 (maximum pattern strength). The exact scale and interpretation
    may depend on internal algorithmic implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float strength = playerPatternRecognition->CalculatePatternStrength(patternSignature);\n\
      if (strength > 0.8f) {\n    // Pattern is highly significant\n    // Perform\
      \ special handling or logging\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pattern Strength Analysis
    code: "PatternSignature signature = player->GetLastKnownPattern();\nfloat strength\
      \ = playerPatternRecognition->CalculatePatternStrength(signature);\nswitch (strength)\
      \ {\n    case strength >= 0.9f: // Very strong pattern\n        // Log for potential\
      \ ban or reward\n        break;\n    case strength >= 0.7f:\n        // Monitor\
      \ behavior\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Ignore or log as normal\
      \ activity\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in anti-cheat systems or behavioral analysis modules
    within TrinityCore. It may involve complex pattern matching algorithms that compare
    against known signatures, player action sequences, or other behavioral data. The
    performance of this method could be impacted by the complexity of the input pattern
    and the internal database size.
  warnings: This method assumes valid input patterns; invalid or malformed patterns
    might produce unexpected results or throw exceptions. Developers should validate
    pattern inputs before calling this method to ensure predictable behavior.
