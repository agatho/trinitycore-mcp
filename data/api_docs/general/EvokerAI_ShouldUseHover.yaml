  class: EvokerAI
  method: ShouldUseHover
  signature: bool EvokerAI::ShouldUseHover()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the evoker should use hover mechanics based on current
    game state and conditions.
  description: The ShouldUseHover method evaluates various factors such as player
    position, target status, spell availability, and combat context to decide if the
    evoker AI should activate hover movement. This is typically used in conjunction
    with evoker-specific abilities that require hovering above ground or water for
    optimal effectiveness. The method considers environmental constraints, cooldowns,
    and tactical positioning to make an informed decision about hover usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the evoker should use hover mechanics; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of true indicates that hover movement is beneficial or necessary
    based on current conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Logic
    code: "if (evokerAI->ShouldUseHover()) {\n    evoker->SetHover(true);\n    //\
      \ Execute hover-based spell or movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Check
    code: "void EvokerCombatBehavior::UpdateAI() {\n    if (ShouldUseHover()) {\n\
      \        MoveToTargetWithHover();\n    } else {\n        MoveToTargetNormal();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI state tracking and may be called
    frequently during combat updates. It's important to note that hover usage should
    not conflict with other movement or spell casting logic. The implementation might
    consider factors like line of sight, target distance, and terrain height differences.
  warnings: Improper use of hover mechanics can lead to unexpected behavior such as
    getting stuck in terrain or missing optimal spell cast windows. Ensure this method
    is only called when the evoker has a valid target and appropriate conditions are
    met.
