  class: SocialManager
  method: SetChatEnabled
  signature: void SocialManager::SetChatEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the player's chat functionality in the social system.
  description: The SetChatEnabled method controls whether a player can send and receive
    chat messages within the game. This method modifies the internal state of the
    social manager to reflect the desired chat enabled status. When enabled, the player
    can participate in chat channels, private messages, and other communication features.
    When disabled, chat functionality is effectively turned off for that player. This
    setting typically affects all chat types including general, trade, guild, and
    officer channels. The change takes effect immediately and persists until explicitly
    modified again.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean value indicating whether chat should be enabled (true) or
      disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable player chat
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetChatEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable player chat temporarily
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetChatEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's social state and may affect other
    systems that depend on chat availability. The change is applied immediately without
    requiring a server restart or reload of the player's session.
  warnings: Disabling chat may prevent players from receiving important game notifications
    or communicating with guild members, potentially affecting gameplay experience.
    Ensure proper use cases are considered before disabling chat functionality.
