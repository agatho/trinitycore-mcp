  method: CalculateHealerScore
  signature: uint32 LFGRoleDetector::CalculateHealerScore(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a healer role score for the specified player based
    on their attributes and capabilities.
  description: The CalculateHealerScore method evaluates a player's suitability for
    a healer role within the context of Looking For Group (LFG) systems. It analyzes
    various player characteristics such as stats, talents, gear, and class-specific
    abilities to determine how well-suited the player is for providing healing support
    in group content. This score helps in matching players with appropriate roles
    during LFG matchmaking processes. The method assumes that the player object passed
    to it is valid and represents an active character within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated healer role score. Higher scores
    indicate better suitability for healing roles, while lower scores suggest less
    effectiveness or incompatibility with healing duties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint32 healerScore\
      \ = lfgRoleDetector->CalculateHealerScore(player);\n// Use healerScore to determine\
      \ role suitability\nif (healerScore > 500)\n{\n    // Player is suitable for\
      \ healer role\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving player stats, class-specific
    healing abilities, and gear quality. It may be used internally by LFG systems
    to optimize group composition and ensure balanced team roles.
