documentation:
  brief: Updates the fire state of the mage, managing spell casting and aura effects.
  description: The UpdateFireState method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the current fire-related state of a Fire Mage character. This includes managing
    active fire spells, updating fire damage over time effects, handling cooldowns,
    and ensuring proper interaction between various fire-based abilities. The method
    typically runs on a periodic basis within the AI update loop to keep the mage's
    fire state synchronized with game mechanics and player actions. It may also handle
    transitions between different fire states such as preparing for a burst of fire
    spells or entering a defensive fire shield mode.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Fire State Call
    code: 'FireMageRefactored* mage = ...;

      mage->UpdateFireState();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop or spell handling
    system. It may modify internal state variables such as spell cooldown timers,
    active aura durations, and damage counters. The implementation should be efficient
    to avoid performance bottlenecks in combat situations.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly during critical spell casting sequences
    as it might interfere with spell queue management. Ensure that all required preconditions
    for fire-based abilities are met before invoking this method.
