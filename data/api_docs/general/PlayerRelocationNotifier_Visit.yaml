documentation:
  brief: Handles player relocation notifications during world updates
  description: The Visit method in PlayerRelocationNotifier is responsible for processing
    and notifying players about their current position changes within the game world.
    This method is typically invoked during the world update cycle to ensure that
    player clients are synchronized with their updated positions, including handling
    visibility changes, object updates, and network transmission of relocation data.
    The method operates on a reference parameter that likely represents internal state
    or context information needed for the relocation process.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Reference to an integer parameter used internally for tracking relocation
      state or context information during the notification process
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in world update loop
    code: 'PlayerRelocationNotifier notifier;

      int relocationState = 0;

      notifier.Visit(relocationState);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core WorldObject relocation system and should
    only be called during appropriate update cycles to maintain synchronization between
    server and client states. The parameter may be modified during execution to reflect
    updated relocation context.
  warnings: Improper usage or calling this method outside of the intended update cycle
    can cause synchronization issues with player clients, potentially leading to visual
    glitches or incorrect object visibility.
