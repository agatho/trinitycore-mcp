  class: MageAI
  method: UseConeOfCold
  signature: void MageAI::UseConeOfCold(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Cone of Cold spell targeting a specified number of enemies.
  description: The UseConeOfCold method is responsible for casting the Cone of Cold
    spell in the MageAI class, which is a frost magic ability that deals damage to
    multiple enemies within a cone-shaped area. This method determines the optimal
    targeting and execution of the spell based on the number of enemies present. The
    implementation likely includes checks for spell availability, line of sight, mana
    costs, and cooldowns before executing the spell. It's designed to be called during
    AI decision-making processes when the mage detects multiple nearby enemies that
    would benefit from the area-of-effect damage.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: The number of enemies within the cone of cold's range that will be
      targeted by the spell. This parameter determines how many targets the spell
      affects and influences targeting logic.
  returns: null

    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        Unit* target = me->GetVictim();\n        if (target && !me->IsWithinMeleeRange(target))\n\
      \        {\n            // Count enemies in cone range\n            int enemyCount\
      \ = CountEnemiesInConeRange(target);\n            if (enemyCount > 0)\n    \
      \        {\n                UseConeOfCold(enemyCount);\n            }\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the MageAI class's combat decision-making system and
    assumes that the AI has already determined it is appropriate to use the Cone of
    Cold spell. The implementation likely includes internal checks for spell cooldowns,
    mana availability, and target validity before proceeding with the actual spell
    casting.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the mage has sufficient mana and
    the spell is not on cooldown. Calling this method without proper preconditions
    may result in failed spell casts or unexpected behavior in combat situations.
