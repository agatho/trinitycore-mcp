  method: HandleAoEDecisions
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::HandleAoEDecisions(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and executes area-of-effect abilities for the Demon Hunter AI.
  description: The HandleAoEDecisions method is responsible for determining when and
    which area-of-effect spells or abilities should be cast by a Demon Hunter AI.
    This method analyzes the current combat situation, including enemy positioning,
    health thresholds, and available resources such as Fury or Discipline power. It
    evaluates whether using an AoE ability like Eye Beam, Chaos Strike, or Sigil of
    Flame would be beneficial based on the number of nearby enemies and their proximity
    to the player. The method also considers cooldowns and tactical positioning to
    ensure optimal usage of these powerful abilities in group or solo encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      for AoE decision making. This parameter may be used internally by the AI to
      determine which enemies are within range for area-of-effect spells.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Demon Hunter AI context
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        int target = 0;\n        HandleAoEDecisions(&target);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom combat logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::HandleAoEDecisions(int* target)\n{\n    if (!me->IsInCombat()\
      \ || !me->GetVictim())\n        return;\n\n    // Check for multiple enemies\
      \ in range\n    std::list<Unit*> targets = GetNearbyEnemies(10.0f);\n    if\
      \ (targets.size() >= 3)\n    {\n        // Cast Eye Beam if available and not\
      \ on cooldown\n        if (me->HasSpellCooldown(SPELL_EYE_BEAM))\n         \
      \   return;\n        \n        DoCast(SPELL_EYE_BEAM);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI update cycle and relies heavily
    on the current state of the battlefield, including enemy positions and player
    resource levels. It's important to note that AoE decisions are context-sensitive
    and may vary depending on the Demon Hunter's specialization (Havoc or Vengeance).
    The method assumes that the AI has already performed basic target selection and
    positioning checks before calling this function.
  warnings: Improper handling of the 'target' parameter could lead to incorrect targeting
    behavior. Ensure that any modifications to the target value are done carefully,
    as they may affect other parts of the AI logic. Also, be cautious when using AoE
    abilities in crowded environments where friendly fire might occur.
