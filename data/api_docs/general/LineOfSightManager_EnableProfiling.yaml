  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: EnableProfiling
  signature: void LineOfSightManager::EnableProfiling(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables profiling for line-of-sight calculations within the World
    of Warcraft server.
  description: The EnableProfiling method controls whether detailed performance metrics
    are collected for line-of-sight (LoS) checks performed by the LineOfSightManager.
    When enabled, this feature tracks execution time and other relevant statistics
    for LoS operations, which can be useful for debugging performance bottlenecks
    or optimizing AI behavior in the game world. This method does not affect the actual
    functionality of line-of-sight calculations; it only toggles the collection of
    profiling data. The profiling state is typically used during development or debugging
    sessions to analyze how often and how long LoS checks take to complete.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      profiling for line-of-sight calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable LoS Profiling
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = sObjectAccessor->GetLineOfSightManager();

      losManager->EnableProfiling(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable LoS Profiling
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = sObjectAccessor->GetLineOfSightManager();

      losManager->EnableProfiling(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for developers and debugging purposes.
    Enabling profiling may introduce a small performance overhead due to additional
    timing measurements, but it should not significantly impact gameplay in production
    environments. The collected data can be accessed through other methods or logging
    systems provided by the LineOfSightManager class.
