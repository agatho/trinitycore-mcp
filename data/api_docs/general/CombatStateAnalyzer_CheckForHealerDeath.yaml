documentation:
  brief: Checks if a healer unit in the combat state has died and returns true if
    so.
  description: The CheckForHealerDeath method evaluates the current combat state to
    determine whether any healer units (such as priests, druids, or paladins) that
    were previously engaged in combat have since died. This method is typically used
    within AI logic or combat analysis systems to track the status of healers during
    encounters. It does not modify any internal state but rather performs a read-only
    check on the existing combat data. The method assumes that healer units are tracked
    and their death status is maintained by the CombatStateAnalyzer instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one healer unit in the current combat state has
    died; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.CheckForHealerDeath()) {\n    // Handle healer death event\n\
      \    Log(\"Healer has died, adjusting strategy.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a combat state tracking system and should only be
    called when the combat state is fully initialized. It relies on internal tracking
    of healer units and their statuses, so calling it before proper initialization
    may result in incorrect behavior.
