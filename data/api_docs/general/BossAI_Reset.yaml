documentation:
  brief: Resets the boss AI state to its initial conditions.
  description: The Reset method in BossAI is responsible for restoring the boss creature's
    AI behavior to its default state. This typically involves clearing any active
    abilities, resetting combat timers, and reinitializing the AI's internal state
    variables. It is commonly called during boss encounters when the encounter needs
    to be restarted or when a boss is being reset after a wipe. The method ensures
    that all AI-related data structures are properly cleaned up and reinitialized
    before the boss begins its next phase or encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Reset Usage
    code: "void BossEncounter::OnReset()\n{\n    if (m_bossAI)\n        m_bossAI->Reset();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset with Encounter State Management
    code: "class MyBossAI : public BossAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Reset() override\n\
      \    {\n        BossAI::Reset(); // Call base reset first\n        // Additional\
      \ custom reset logic here\n        m_phase = 0;\n        m_isActive = false;\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Reset method is typically invoked by the core TrinityCore framework during
    encounter management, such as when a boss dies and the encounter needs to be reset
    for a new attempt. Developers should ensure that any custom AI logic in overridden
    Reset methods calls the base class implementation first to maintain proper behavior.
  warnings: Improperly implementing or skipping the base BossAI::Reset() call may
    lead to inconsistent AI states, lingering timers, or unexpected behavior during
    boss encounters. Always verify that all AI-related resources are properly cleaned
    up during reset operations.
