documentation:
  brief: Attempts to resurrect a player from the graveyard using the DeathRecoveryManager's
    internal logic.
  description: The ExecuteGraveyardResurrection method is responsible for handling
    the resurrection process of a player who has died and is located in a graveyard.
    This method typically checks if the player is eligible for resurrection, verifies
    the existence of a nearby graveyard, and performs the necessary game state updates
    to return the player to life. It may also handle associated cooldowns, resource
    costs, or quest-related resurrection conditions depending on the server configuration.
    The method returns true if the resurrection was successfully initiated, and false
    otherwise, which could happen due to invalid player state, missing graveyard,
    or insufficient resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the resurrection process was successfully started or completed,
    false if it failed due to conditions such as invalid player state, no available
    graveyard, or insufficient resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a death handler
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.ExecuteGraveyardResurrection()) {\n    // Resurrection\
      \ successful\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You have been resurrected!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Resurrection failed\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Resurrection failed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the death processing phase of a player's
    lifecycle, often triggered by events such as combat loss or area trigger activation.
    It may interact with other systems like the player's corpse management and graveyard
    system to ensure proper resurrection mechanics.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on players who are already alive or in
    an invalid state, as it may lead to undefined behavior or game state corruption.
    Ensure that all preconditions (e.g., player is dead, graveyard exists) are met
    before invoking this method.
