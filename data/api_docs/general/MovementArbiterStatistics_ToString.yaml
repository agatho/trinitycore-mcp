  brief: Converts movement arbiter statistics into a human-readable string format
  description: The ToString method serializes the internal state of MovementArbiterStatistics
    into a formatted string representation. This method is typically used for debugging,
    logging, or displaying movement-related statistics in a readable format. The output
    includes all relevant statistical data collected by the movement arbiter, such
    as processed movements, rejected moves, and timing information. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of all movement arbiter
    statistics, including key-value pairs for each statistical metric
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'MovementArbiterStatistics stats;

      // ... populate stats with data ...

      std::string logLine = stats.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("movement", "Movement Arbiter Stats: {}", logLine);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs string formatting operations and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical code paths. The returned string format is
    designed for human readability rather than machine parsing.
