api:
  class: BattlegroundQueue
  method: CheckSkirmishForSameFaction
  signature: bool BattlegroundQueue::CheckSkirmishForSameFaction(int bracket_id, uint32
    minPlayersPerTeam)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if skirmish battlegrounds are configured to allow same faction players
    in the queue for the specified bracket.
  description: The CheckSkirmishForSameFaction method evaluates whether skirmish battlegrounds
    are set up to permit players from the same faction to queue together for a specific
    bracket. This functionality is crucial for maintaining balanced matchmaking in
    skirmish modes where team composition matters. The method takes into account the
    bracket identifier and minimum player requirements per team to determine if the
    configuration allows same-faction participation. It typically returns true if
    same-faction queuing is enabled, and false otherwise. This check is performed
    during battleground queue processing to ensure proper matchmaking rules are enforced.
  parameters:
  - name: bracket_id
    description: The identifier of the bracket being checked for skirmish configuration.
      This typically corresponds to a specific battleground bracket such as 10v10,
      15v15, or 25v25.
  - name: minPlayersPerTeam
    description: The minimum number of players required per team in the skirmish match.
      This parameter is used to validate the queue configuration against expected
      team sizes for the given bracket.
  returns: Returns true if the skirmish battleground configuration allows same-faction
    players to be queued together for the specified bracket and minimum player count;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CheckSkirmishForSameFaction
    code: "if (BattlegroundQueue::CheckSkirmishForSameFaction(10, 5)) {\n    // Same-faction\
      \ queuing is allowed for 10v10 bracket with minimum 5 players per team\n   \
      \ sLog->outString(\"Same-faction queuing enabled for 10v10\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // Same-faction queuing is disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"Same-faction\
      \ queuing disabled for 10v10\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal battleground configuration tables
    and may be called during queue initialization or validation. It's important to
    note that the behavior might vary depending on server settings and battleground
    type configurations.
