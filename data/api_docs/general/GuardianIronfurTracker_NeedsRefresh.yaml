  method: NeedsRefresh
  signature: bool GuardianIronfurTracker::NeedsRefresh() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Ironfur guardian's aura needs to be refreshed based
    on current game state conditions.
  description: The NeedsRefresh method evaluates if the Ironfur guardian's active
    aura requires updating or reapplying. This typically occurs when the aura's duration
    is nearing expiration, or when certain environmental or combat conditions have
    changed that would affect the aura's effectiveness. The method checks internal
    state variables and game mechanics to determine if a refresh operation should
    be triggered. It is commonly used in AI decision-making loops for guardians to
    maintain optimal buffing performance during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Ironfur aura requires a refresh due to expiration,
    condition changes, or other triggering factors; otherwise returns false if the
    aura remains valid and does not need updating.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (guardian->GetIronfurTracker()->NeedsRefresh()) {\n    guardian->ApplyIronfurAura();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs lightweight checks against cached state values
    rather than expensive computations. It should be called frequently in AI update
    loops to ensure timely aura management.
