  brief: Updates the attack timing for kiting behavior based on current target and
    player state
  description: The UpdateAttackTiming method adjusts the timing of melee attacks for
    kiting mechanics, ensuring that attacks are properly spaced according to the player's
    movement and target proximity. This method is typically invoked during AI update
    cycles to maintain optimal combat timing while performing kiting strategies. It
    evaluates the current attack speed, target distance, and player movement state
    to determine appropriate attack timing. The method does not directly perform attacks
    but modifies internal timing variables that influence when the next attack will
    be executed. This functionality is crucial for maintaining effective kiting behavior
    in both PvE and PvP scenarios where precise timing can impact damage output and
    survival.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Cycle
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    _kitingManager.UpdateAttackTiming();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    proper kiting timing. The implementation likely considers factors such as attack
    speed modifiers, target movement, and distance thresholds. It may interact with
    other kiting-related methods like SetKitingState() or GetAttackDelay(). This method
    is typically not thread-safe and should only be called from the main game thread.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper AI update contexts may lead to inconsistent
    attack timing behavior. Do not call this method during combat state transitions
    without ensuring proper synchronization. The method assumes that target and player
    states are valid, so calling it with invalid targets or uninitialized players
    may cause unexpected behavior.
