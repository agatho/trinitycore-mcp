  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: CalculateHealerPosition
  signature: int CombatMovementStrategy::CalculateHealerPosition(Player * player,
    Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal healer position relative to the target
    unit for a given player.
  description: The CalculateHealerPosition method determines the best positioning
    strategy for a healer player in relation to their target unit within the context
    of combat movement. This method evaluates factors such as the player's current
    location, the target's position, and potential threat levels to compute an appropriate
    healing stance or movement pattern. It is typically used by AI systems to optimize
    healer behavior during encounters. The returned value represents a calculated
    positioning index that can be interpreted by the game engine to adjust the healer's
    movement or positioning strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer character performing
      the calculation. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit that the
      healer is positioned relative to. Must not be null.
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated optimal healer position. Positive
    values indicate positioning to the front or side of the target, while negative
    values suggest positioning behind or at a distance. Zero typically indicates no
    specific positioning change is required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "int position = strategy.CalculateHealerPosition(player, target);\nif (position\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Move to front of target\n    player->MoveTo(target->GetPositionX(),\
      \ target->GetPositionY(), target->GetPositionZ() + 2.0f);\n} else if (position\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Move behind target\n    player->MoveTo(target->GetPositionX(),\
      \ target->GetPositionY(), target->GetPositionZ() - 2.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatMovementStrategy class and relies on internal
    AI calculations that consider combat state, player class abilities, and target
    threat level. The exact positioning logic may vary based on the healer's specialization
    and current gear. Performance-wise, this method should be called sparingly during
    active combat to avoid impacting frame rate.
  warnings: Ensure both player and target parameters are valid non-null pointers before
    calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. The returned integer
    value should not be directly used for movement without proper interpretation of
    the positioning context.
