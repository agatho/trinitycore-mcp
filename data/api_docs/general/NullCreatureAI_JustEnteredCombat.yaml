documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature enters combat mode
  description: The JustEnteredCombat method is called when a creature AI transitions
    into combat state. This method is part of the NullCreatureAI class and serves
    as a placeholder or base implementation for combat entry logic. It typically handles
    initialization tasks such as setting up combat-related flags, starting combat
    timers, or triggering initial combat behaviors. The method may be overridden by
    derived AI classes to implement custom combat behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that may represent combat state flags
      or other contextual data related to the combat entry event
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI class
    code: "class MyCustomAI : public NullCreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEnteredCombat(int*\
      \ param0) override {\n        // Custom combat initialization logic\n      \
      \  if (param0 != nullptr) {\n            *param0 = 1; // Set combat flag\n \
      \       }\n        // Additional combat setup\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game engine when a creature's
    combat state changes. The parameter may be used to pass additional context about
    the combat initiation, such as the source of the combat trigger or combat state
    flags.
  warnings: Ensure that any override of this method properly handles null pointer
    checks for the parameter. Improper handling may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes during combat transitions.
