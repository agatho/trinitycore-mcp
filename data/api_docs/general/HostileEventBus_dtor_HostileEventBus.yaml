documentation:
  brief: Destroys the HostileEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the HostileEventBus class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were managed by
    this event bus. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and combat system, this class
    likely handles events related to hostile actions such as aggro generation, threat
    updates, or enemy targeting. The destructor ensures that all subscribers are properly
    removed and any internal data structures are freed to prevent memory leaks. This
    method is automatically invoked when a HostileEventBus object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of HostileEventBus instance
    code: 'HostileEventBus* eventBus = new HostileEventBus();

      // ... use the event bus ...

      delete eventBus; // Triggers ~HostileEventBus()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via stack allocation
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    HostileEventBus localBus;\n    // ... use localBus\
      \ ...\n    // ~HostileEventBus() automatically called when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during stack unwinding or
    explicit deletion. Since this is a destructor, it's important to ensure all base
    class destructors are properly virtual if inheritance is involved.
