  signature: void LootStore::ReportNonExistingId(uint32 lootId, const char * ownerType,
    uint32 ownerId) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a warning message when a loot entry ID is referenced but does not exist
    in the loot store.
  description: The ReportNonExistingId method is used to log a warning whenever a
    loot ID is attempted to be accessed or referenced, but no corresponding loot entry
    exists within the LootStore. This typically occurs during loot processing when
    an item or group references a loot template that has been removed, deleted, or
    never existed in the database. The method helps developers and administrators
    identify missing loot data that could cause issues with game mechanics such as
    quest rewards, creature drops, or loot table integrity. It is primarily used for
    debugging and maintaining data consistency within the TrinityCore system.
  parameters:
  - name: lootId
    description: The unique identifier of the loot entry that does not exist in the
      store. This ID typically corresponds to a template or entry in the loot database
      tables.
  - name: ownerType
    description: A string describing the type of entity that owns or references this
      loot ID, such as 'creature', 'gameobject', or 'item'. Used for categorizing
      and filtering log messages.
  - name: ownerId
    description: The unique identifier of the owner entity (e.g., creature entry ID,
      game object ID) that references the non-existing loot ID. Helps trace back which
      object is causing the issue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: 'LootStore store;

      // Simulate finding a reference to a non-existent loot ID

      store.ReportNonExistingId(12345, "creature", 1001);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with logging system
    code: "void ProcessLootTemplate(uint32 lootId, uint32 ownerEntry)\n{\n    if (!sLootStore.LookupEntry(lootId))\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outError(\"Loot ID %u referenced by creature %u does not\
      \ exist in loot store.\", lootId, ownerEntry);\n        sLootStore.ReportNonExistingId(lootId,\
      \ \"creature\", ownerEntry);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot system when a lookup
    fails. It does not modify any data but only reports the issue via logging. Developers
    should ensure that all loot IDs referenced in game data are valid and exist in
    their respective loot stores to avoid performance penalties or incorrect behavior
    during loot distribution.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., null ownerType) may
    result in malformed log messages. Always validate input before calling this function,
    especially when integrating it into automated systems or custom loot processing
    logic.
