documentation:
  brief: Attempts to cast the item to an Azerite item and returns a pointer to its
    internal data.
  description: The ToAzeriteItem method is used to determine if the current Item object
    represents an Azerite item, and if so, returns a pointer to its internal Azerite-specific
    data structure. This method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    Azerite system, where items can be upgraded with Azerite powers. The returned
    pointer may be null if the item is not an Azerite item or if the underlying data
    has not been initialized properly. It is important to note that this method does
    not perform any conversion or modification of the item itself; it merely provides
    access to the Azerite-specific data if available.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to the internal Azerite data structure of the item,
    or nullptr if the item is not an Azerite item or if the data is not accessible.
    The returned pointer should be used carefully as it points to internal memory
    managed by the Item object.
  examples:
  - title: Check if item is Azerite and access its data
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 15); // Get equipped weapon\nconst\
      \ int* azeriteData = item->ToAzeriteItem();\nif (azeriteData != nullptr)\n{\n\
      \    // Item is Azerite, can safely access azeriteData\n    // Use azeriteData\
      \ for further processing\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Item is not an Azerite item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Azerite system implementation in TrinityCore.
    The returned pointer should not be modified directly as it points to internal
    data structures managed by the Item class. It's recommended to check for null
    before dereferencing the returned pointer.
  warnings: Using the returned pointer without checking for null can lead to segmentation
    faults or undefined behavior. This method may return nullptr even if the item
    is an Azerite item but hasn't been fully initialized in certain contexts, such
    as during item creation or loading phases.
