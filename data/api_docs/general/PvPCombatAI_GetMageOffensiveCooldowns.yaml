  method: GetMageOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetMageOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current offensive cooldown status for a mage player in PvP
    combat.
  description: The GetMageOffensiveCooldowns method is used to determine the state
    of offensive spell cooldowns for a mage class player within the PvPCombatAI system.
    This method evaluates the player's current cooldown timers and returns an integer
    value representing the cooldown status, which can be used by the AI to make decisions
    about when to cast offensive spells. The returned value typically indicates whether
    specific offensive abilities are available or on cooldown, allowing the AI to
    optimize spell usage during PvP encounters. This functionality is crucial for
    maintaining balanced and strategic gameplay behavior in player versus player scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose offensive cooldowns are being
      evaluated. This parameter should point to a valid Player instance representing
      the mage class character in PvP combat.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the current state of offensive cooldowns
    for the mage player. A return value of 0 typically means all offensive abilities
    are available, while positive values may indicate remaining cooldown time or specific
    ability status. Negative values might represent error conditions or special states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* magePlayer = ...; // Get player reference\nint cooldownStatus =\
      \ pvpAI->GetMageOffensiveCooldowns(magePlayer);\nif (cooldownStatus == 0) {\n\
      \    // All offensive abilities available\n    // Cast powerful offensive spell\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Decision Making
    code: "Player* magePlayer = ...;\nint cooldownStatus = pvpAI->GetMageOffensiveCooldowns(magePlayer);\n\
      switch (cooldownStatus) {\n    case 0:\n        // All abilities available -\
      \ cast highest damage spell\n        break;\n    case 1:\n        // Some abilities\
      \ on cooldown - use alternative strategy\n        break;\n    default:\n   \
      \     // Error or special state handling\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and should only be called during
    active PvP combat scenarios. The implementation likely caches cooldown information
    to avoid expensive calculations on every call. Developers should ensure that the
    player parameter points to a valid mage class character, as behavior with other
    classes may be undefined.
  warnings: The method signature includes a pointer parameter that must not be null.
    Passing an invalid or uninitialized player object will result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, the return value interpretation may vary based on internal implementation
    details and should be verified against current TrinityCore source code for accuracy.
