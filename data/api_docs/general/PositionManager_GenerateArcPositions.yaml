  class: PositionManager
  method: GenerateArcPositions
  signature: int PositionManager::GenerateArcPositions(const int & center, float radius,
    float startAngle, float endAngle, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of evenly distributed positions along an arc centered at
    the specified location.
  description: The GenerateArcPositions method calculates and returns a series of
    positional coordinates that lie along a circular arc defined by a center point,
    radius, start angle, and end angle. It is commonly used in game mechanics for
    effects such as area-of-effect spells, projectile trajectories, or visual effects
    that require multiple points along a curved path. The method takes into account
    the number of positions to generate and distributes them evenly across the specified
    angular range. This function is typically part of the PositionManager class which
    handles various position-related calculations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the arc, represented as an integer identifier
      (likely a GUID or similar unique reference). Defines the origin around which
      the arc is generated.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the arc in game units. Determines how far from the
      center point each generated position will be located.
  - name: startAngle
    description: The starting angle of the arc in radians. Defines where the arc begins
      along the circular path.
  - name: endAngle
    description: The ending angle of the arc in radians. Defines where the arc terminates
      along the circular path.
  - name: count
    description: The number of positions to generate along the arc. Must be a positive
      integer; specifies how many points will be calculated and returned.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the operation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values may indicate
    errors such as invalid parameters (e.g., zero or negative count, invalid angles).
    Positive non-zero return values might represent specific error codes depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to generate positions along a semicircular arc
    code: "PositionManager posMgr;\nint result = posMgr.GenerateArcPositions(12345,\
      \ 10.0f, 0.0f, M_PI, 5); // Generate 5 points along a half-circle with radius\
      \ 10\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Successfully generated positions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage for creating a full circular effect
    code: "PositionManager posMgr;\nconst float fullCircle = 2.0f * M_PI;\nint result\
      \ = posMgr.GenerateArcPositions(67890, 15.0f, 0.0f, fullCircle, 12); // Generate\
      \ 12 points for a full circle\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Successfully generated\
      \ positions for a circular effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the 'center' parameter refers to a valid object
    or location within the game world. The implementation likely uses trigonometric
    functions (sine and cosine) to compute positions along the arc. Performance is
    dependent on the number of points requested; generating large numbers of positions
    may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: "Ensure that the 'count' parameter is a positive integer, as negative\
    \ or zero values could lead to undefined behavior or errors. Be cautious when\
    \ using very large values for count, especially in real-time systems where performance\
    \ matters. Also, verify that the startAngle and endAngle are within valid ranges\
    \ (typically 0 to 2\u03C0 radians) to avoid unexpected arc shapes."
