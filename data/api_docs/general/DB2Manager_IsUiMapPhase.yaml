  signature: bool DB2Manager::IsUiMapPhase(uint32 phaseId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given phase ID corresponds to a UI map phase in the database.
  description: The IsUiMapPhase method determines whether a specified phase ID represents
    a UI map phase within the TrinityCore database. This functionality is typically
    used during game logic processing to identify special phases that are associated
    with user interface elements or map-related visual states. The method performs
    a lookup in the internal DB2 data structures to verify if the provided phase ID
    has been marked as a UI map phase. It's commonly utilized when handling map transitions,
    UI visibility conditions, or phase-based rendering logic for game clients.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified phase ID corresponds to a UI map phase; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->IsUiMapPhase(1234)) {\n    // Handle UI map phase logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Phase 1234 is a UI map phase\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Phase Handling
    code: "uint32 currentPhase = player->GetPhaseMask();\nif (sDB2Manager->IsUiMapPhase(currentPhase))\
      \ {\n    // Apply UI-specific logic for this phase\n    player->SendUpdateWorldState(0x1234,\
      \ 1); // Example UI update\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures that are loaded at server
    startup. The performance is optimized through internal caching mechanisms, making
    repeated calls efficient. The method assumes that phase IDs passed to it are valid
    and exist in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the phase ID being checked is valid and exists in the database
    before calling this method. Passing invalid or uninitialized phase IDs may lead
    to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
