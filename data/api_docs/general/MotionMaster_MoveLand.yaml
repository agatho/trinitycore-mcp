  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveLand
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveLand(uint32 id, const Position & pos, int tierTransitionId,
    int velocity, MovementWalkRunSpeedSelectionMode speedSelectionMode, int param5)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a landing movement for a creature or unit at the specified position
    with optional speed and transition parameters.
  description: The MoveLand method instructs a motion master to execute a landing
    movement sequence for a creature or unit. This method is typically used in AI
    behavior scripting to control how units land after flight or other aerial movements.
    It accepts various parameters including an identifier, target position, tier transition
    ID, velocity, speed selection mode, and an additional parameter that may influence
    movement behavior. The method does not return any value but modifies the motion
    state of the associated unit. This functionality is integral to creature movement
    mechanics in TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for this movement action, used to distinguish between
      different movement sequences or behaviors.
  - name: pos
    description: Target position where the unit should land, specified as a Position
      object containing X, Y, Z coordinates and orientation.
  - name: tierTransitionId
    description: Identifier for tier transitions during landing, potentially used
      to control different movement phases or animations based on altitude or terrain
      changes.
  - name: velocity
    description: Movement velocity value that determines how fast the unit should
      move during the landing sequence.
  - name: speedSelectionMode
    description: Enumeration value that selects whether to use walk or run speed for
      the movement, affecting overall animation and movement behavior.
  - name: param5
    description: Additional parameter that may influence specific aspects of the landing
      behavior, such as special effects or movement modifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Landing Movement
    code: 'Position landingPos(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f);

      MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      mm->MoveLand(1, landingPos, 0, 5, MOVEMENT_WALK_SPEED, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Landing with Specific Speed Selection
    code: 'Position landingPos(300.0f, 400.0f, 100.0f);

      MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      mm->MoveLand(2, landingPos, 1, 10, MOVEMENT_RUN_SPEED, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the motion system and integrates with TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It should be called on a valid MotionMaster instance that controls
    a creature or unit. The movement will only take effect if the unit has not already
    been assigned another movement type.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the MotionMaster
    or invalid Position parameters may result in undefined behavior or failed movement
    execution. Ensure that the target position is within valid bounds and accessible
    for the unit's movement type.
