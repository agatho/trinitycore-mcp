  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: GetModelStatistics
  signature: ModelStatistics MLPerformanceTracker::GetModelStatistics(uint32_t botGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance statistics for a specific AI model associated with
    the given bot GUID.
  description: The GetModelStatistics method fetches detailed performance metrics
    and tracking data for an AI model identified by its unique bot GUID. This function
    is typically used within the TrinityCore's AI subsystem to monitor and analyze
    the behavior and efficiency of different bot models during gameplay. The returned
    ModelStatistics object contains various metrics such as execution times, memory
    usage, and other relevant performance indicators that help developers and administrators
    understand how well a particular AI model is performing. The method assumes that
    the bot with the specified GUID exists and has been properly initialized within
    the system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose model statistics are
      to be retrieved. This value must correspond to an existing bot instance in the
      system.
  returns: A ModelStatistics object containing performance metrics for the specified
    AI model. Returns an empty or default-initialized structure if no data is available
    for the given GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Model Statistics
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      MLPerformanceTracker* tracker = sWorld->GetMLPerformanceTracker();

      ModelStatistics stats = tracker->GetModelStatistics(botGuid);

      printf("Execution Time: %f ms\n", stats.executionTime);

      printf("Memory Usage: %zu bytes\n", stats.memoryUsage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Valid Statistics Before Use
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nMLPerformanceTracker* tracker = sWorld->GetMLPerformanceTracker();\n\
      ModelStatistics stats = tracker->GetModelStatistics(botGuid);\nif (stats.executionTime\
      \ > 0.0f) {\n    // Process valid statistics\n    std::cout << \"Valid performance\
      \ data available\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle missing or invalid\
      \ data\n    std::cout << \"No performance data found for bot\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause race conditions
    when called from multiple threads. It is recommended to cache the returned ModelStatistics
    object if frequent access is required, as repeated calls may involve internal
    lookups or computations. The performance tracking system must be enabled for this
    method to return meaningful data.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or return default/empty statistics. Ensure that the bot
    exists and has been initialized before calling this function. Do not rely on the
    returned structure being populated if no performance tracking data is available
    for the specified GUID.
