  class: Map
  method: GetMinHeight
  signature: float Map::GetMinHeight(const PhaseShift & phaseShift, float x, float
    y)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum height value for a given position within the map.
  description: The GetMinHeight method returns the lowest point height in the map
    at the specified coordinates, taking into account the current phase shift. This
    is essential for determining terrain elevation and collision detection in World
    of Warcraft. The method considers the phaseShift parameter to ensure accurate
    height calculation based on the current phase state of the map, which affects
    how objects are rendered or interacted with in different phases. It's commonly
    used in pathfinding calculations and for determining whether an object can pass
    through a specific area without colliding.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The phase shift that determines the current phase state of the map,
      affecting how height values are calculated. This parameter is crucial for accurate
      terrain height determination.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate position in the world space where the minimum height
      is to be determined. Valid range typically covers the entire map area.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate position in the world space where the minimum height
      is to be determined. Valid range typically covers the entire map area.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the minimum height at the specified
    coordinates, which can be used for collision detection and pathfinding calculations.
    The value may be negative depending on terrain elevation, and represents the lowest
    point in the map at that location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float minHeight = map->GetMinHeight(phaseShift, x, y);\nif (minHeight <\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Handle negative elevation\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with collision detection
    code: "float minHeight = map->GetMinHeight(phaseShift, x, y);\nfloat playerHeight\
      \ = 1.0f;\nif (minHeight > playerHeight)\n{\n    // Player can pass through\
      \ without collision\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other height calculation
    methods to determine terrain features and is part of the core map navigation system.
    Performance considerations include caching frequently accessed height values for
    better efficiency, especially when calculating multiple points.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect height values can
    lead to failed collision detection or pathfinding issues. The phaseShift parameter
    is critical and should always be properly initialized before calling this method.
