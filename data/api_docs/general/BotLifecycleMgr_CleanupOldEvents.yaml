documentation:
  brief: Removes expired or outdated bot lifecycle events from the system
  description: The CleanupOldEvents method is responsible for purging obsolete bot
    lifecycle events that have exceeded their validity period or are no longer relevant.
    This function ensures that the bot management system maintains clean state by
    removing stale entries that could otherwise clutter memory or interfere with new
    event processing. The method typically iterates through registered events and
    removes those that meet specific expiration criteria based on time thresholds
    or completion states.

  - title: Basic Usage in Event Loop
    code: "void BotManager::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    m_botLifecycleMgr->CleanupOldEvents();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically as part of the bot lifecycle management
    routine to prevent memory leaks and maintain system performance. It's recommended
    to schedule this cleanup operation at intervals that balance between performance
    impact and event freshness requirements.
