  class: BotScheduler
  method: GetBotScheduleState
  signature: const BotScheduleState * BotScheduler::GetBotScheduleState(int guid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the schedule state for a bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The GetBotScheduleState method retrieves a constant pointer to the
    BotScheduleState object associated with a specific bot identified by its global
    unique identifier (GUID). This method is used within the TrinityCore AI system
    to access scheduling information for individual bots, which determines their behavior
    patterns and activity states. The returned pointer provides read-only access to
    the schedule state, ensuring that external code cannot modify internal scheduling
    data directly. The method assumes that a valid bot with the specified GUID exists
    in the scheduler's tracking system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose schedule state
      is to be retrieved. This value uniquely identifies each bot instance within
      the TrinityCore world.
  returns: A constant pointer to the BotScheduleState object associated with the specified
    bot GUID, or nullptr if no bot with the given GUID exists in the scheduler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const BotScheduleState* state = scheduler->GetBotScheduleState(12345);\n\
      if (state != nullptr) {\n    // Use the schedule state\n    std::cout << \"\
      Bot is in state: \" << state->GetStateName() << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No bot found with GUID 12345\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Bot Activity
    code: "uint32 botGuid = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      const BotScheduleState* schedule = scheduler->GetBotScheduleState(botGuid);\n\
      if (schedule && schedule->IsScheduledForActivity()) {\n    // Bot is scheduled\
      \ to perform an action\n    DoBotAction(schedule);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure, so
    performance may vary depending on the number of tracked bots. The returned pointer
    remains valid only as long as the bot exists and has not been removed from the
    scheduler. This method is typically used in AI decision-making loops where current
    scheduling state affects bot behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual bot
    instance, otherwise a null pointer will be returned. Avoid storing the returned
    pointer for extended periods as it may become invalid if the bot is removed from
    the scheduler or its schedule changes.
