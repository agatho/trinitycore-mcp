  class: QuestPickup
  method: ExecuteChainCompletionStrategy
  signature: void QuestPickup::ExecuteChainCompletionStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the chain completion strategy for a quest pickup, determining how
    to handle quest progression when multiple related quests are involved.
  description: The ExecuteChainCompletionStrategy method processes the logic for handling
    quest chains within the TrinityCore framework. When a player completes a quest
    that is part of a chain, this method determines what actions should be taken next,
    such as advancing to the next quest in the sequence or triggering specific quest
    events. It evaluates the current state of the player's quest log and applies appropriate
    completion strategies based on quest dependencies and game mechanics. This method
    is typically invoked during quest completion events and ensures proper progression
    through interconnected quest objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player character
      that is executing the quest chain completion strategy
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    QuestPickup\
      \ pickup;\n    pickup.ExecuteChainCompletionStrategy(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom quest AI system
    code: "class CustomQuestAI\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleQuestChain(Player* bot)\n\
      \    {\n        QuestPickup pickup;\n        pickup.ExecuteChainCompletionStrategy(bot);\n\
      \        // Additional chain logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's quest log and may modify quest
    status flags. It should be called after quest completion events but before any
    UI updates to ensure proper state synchronization. The implementation may involve
    checking for quest dependencies, updating quest objectives, and potentially triggering
    follow-up quest events.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the player's quest state
    may result in unexpected behavior or quest progression issues. Ensure that the
    player object is valid and that the quest chain logic hasn't been corrupted before
    execution.
