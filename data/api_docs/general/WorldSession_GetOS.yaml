documentation:
  brief: Returns the operating system string of the client connected to this session
  description: The GetOS method retrieves the operating system information reported
    by the World of Warcraft client during the login process. This information is
    typically sent as part of the initial handshake and can be used for various purposes
    such as client compatibility checks, anti-cheat measures, or analytics. The returned
    string represents the OS platform that the player's client is running on, which
    may include values like 'Win64', 'OSX', 'Linux', etc. This method provides read-only
    access to the stored OS information and does not modify any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::string containing the operating system identifier
    sent by the client, such as 'Win64', 'OSX', or 'Linux'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to log OS information
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    WorldSession* session =\
      \ player->GetSession();\n    if (session)\n    {\n        std::string osInfo\
      \ = session->GetOS();\n        sLog->outString(\"Player %s logged in from OS:\
      \ %s\", player->GetName().c_str(), osInfo.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using OS information for compatibility checks
    code: "bool IsSupportedOS(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    const std::string& os\
      \ = session->GetOS();\n    return (os == \"Win64\" || os == \"OSX\" || os ==\
      \ \"Linux\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The OS information is set during the initial client connection and is not
    updated dynamically. This method returns a cached value that was captured when
    the session was established. The returned string is typically formatted as uppercase
    identifiers like 'Win64', 'OSX', or 'Linux' based on the client's platform detection.
