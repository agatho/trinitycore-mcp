documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of loot data from one Loot object to another.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on Loot objects,
    transferring all internal resources and state from the source Loot object (passed
    as an rvalue reference) to the current object. This is typically used to efficiently
    transfer loot data without unnecessary copying, especially when dealing with temporary
    or newly created loot containers. The source object becomes invalid after the
    operation and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method is essential for managing loot distribution systems where
    loot objects are frequently moved between different containers or contexts during
    creature looting, quest rewards, or auction house operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current Loot object after the move assignment has been
    completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'Loot sourceLoot;

      // ... populate sourceLoot with loot data ...

      Loot targetLoot = std::move(sourceLoot); // Uses operator=

      // sourceLoot is now in a valid but undefined state'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Loot Distribution Context
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Creature* creature, Player* player) {\n    Loot loot;\n\
      \    creature->GenerateLoot(player, loot);\n    // Transfer loot to player's\
      \ loot container\n    player->GetLoot()->operator=(std::move(loot));\n    //\
      \ loot is now invalid and should not be used\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is crucial for performance optimization
    in systems handling frequent loot object creation and destruction. The move operation
    transfers ownership of internal data structures rather than copying them, reducing
    memory allocation overhead. Developers should ensure that the source Loot object
    is not used after a move assignment to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: After calling operator= with an rvalue reference, the source object becomes
    in a valid but unspecified state. Using the source object afterward leads to undefined
    behavior. This method should only be called with rvalue references (temporary
    objects or those explicitly marked with std::move).
