  class: EquipmentManager
  method: CalculateWeaponScore
  signature: float EquipmentManager::CalculateWeaponScore(int * player, int * weapon)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the weapon score for a given player and weapon combination based
    on item statistics and player attributes.
  description: The CalculateWeaponScore method computes a numerical score representing
    the effectiveness or value of a specific weapon for a given player. This calculation
    typically considers factors such as weapon damage, speed, enchantments, player
    level, class-specific bonuses, and other relevant statistics. The resulting score
    can be used for various game mechanics including weapon comparison, gear optimization,
    loot distribution decisions, or character progression tracking. The method requires
    valid pointers to player and weapon data structures to perform the calculation
    accurately.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player data structure containing player attributes
      such as level, class, stats, and equipped items.
  - name: weapon
    description: Pointer to the weapon data structure containing weapon properties
      including damage range, speed, item level, enchantments, and other stat modifiers.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated weapon score. Higher values indicate
    more powerful or effective weapons for the given player. The exact scoring algorithm
    may vary based on game version and expansion content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weapon Score Calculation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player instance\nItem* weapon = ...; // Get\
      \ weapon item\nfloat score = EquipmentManager::CalculateWeaponScore(player,\
      \ weapon);\nif (score > 100.0f) {\n    // Weapon is considered strong for this\
      \ player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Multiple Weapons
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* mainHand = ...;\nItem* offHand = ...;\nfloat\
      \ mainScore = EquipmentManager::CalculateWeaponScore(player, mainHand);\nfloat\
      \ offScore = EquipmentManager::CalculateWeaponScore(player, offHand);\nif (mainScore\
      \ > offScore) {\n    // Main hand weapon is better\n} else {\n    // Off hand\
      \ weapon is better\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving multiple game
    systems such as item scaling, class specialization bonuses, and player progression
    factors. The exact implementation details are not publicly available but would
    typically involve iterating through weapon stats and applying appropriate multipliers
    or modifiers based on player characteristics.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and weapon pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid segmentation faults. The method may return unexpected results
    if the data structures are not properly initialized or contain invalid values.
