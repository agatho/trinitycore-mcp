documentation:
  brief: Initializes default AI strategies for a bot AI instance
  description: The InitializeDefaultStrategies method configures and sets up the core
    AI behavior strategies for a given BotAI instance. This method establishes the
    fundamental decision-making framework that governs how the bot will act in various
    game scenarios, including combat, movement, and interaction with the environment.
    It typically assigns default strategy priorities and initializes internal state
    variables required for proper AI operation. The method should be called once during
    the bot's initialization phase to ensure all strategies are properly configured
    before the AI begins making decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* ai = new BotAI();

      BotAIFactory factory;

      factory.InitializeDefaultStrategies(ai);

      // Bot is now ready to make AI decisions with default strategies'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically should only be called once per BotAI instance during
    initialization. It may internally create or assign strategy objects that are shared
    across multiple bots, so calling it multiple times on the same instance could
    lead to unexpected behavior. The method assumes that the BotAI parameter is properly
    allocated and valid.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already initialized BotAI instance may cause
    memory leaks or inconsistent AI behavior if strategies are not properly reset.
    Ensure that any existing strategies are cleaned up before calling this method
    if reinitialization is required.
