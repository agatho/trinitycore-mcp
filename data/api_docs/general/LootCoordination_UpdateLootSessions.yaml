documentation:
  brief: Updates all active loot sessions in the coordination system.
  description: The UpdateLootSessions method iterates through all currently active
    loot sessions within the LootCoordination system and performs necessary updates
    on each session. This typically includes checking for loot distribution timeouts,
    updating player participation status, and managing the overall state of loot coordination
    between players and the game world. The method ensures that loot is properly managed
    according to World of Warcraft's loot rules and coordination mechanics, such as
    round-robin or master loot systems. It is called periodically by the game loop
    to maintain session integrity and prevent stale loot states.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sLootCoordination->UpdateLootSessions();\n\
      \    // ... continue with game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop or as part
    of a periodic timer. It's designed to be efficient and non-blocking, but may perform
    multiple operations on active sessions depending on their state. The method assumes
    that all loot sessions have been properly initialized before being called.
