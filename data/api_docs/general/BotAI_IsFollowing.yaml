  class: BotAI
  method: IsFollowing
  signature: bool BotAI::IsFollowing() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot is currently following a target.
  description: The IsFollowing method determines whether the bot AI is currently in
    a following state, meaning it is actively moving towards and maintaining proximity
    to a designated target. This method is typically used within the context of bot
    behavior logic to control movement patterns, combat strategies, and interaction
    with other game entities. The check involves evaluating the internal state of
    the bot's AI system to determine if a follow action has been initiated and is
    still active.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently following a target; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates that the bot's movement behavior is in a continuous following
    mode rather than idle or other states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botAI->IsFollowing()) {\n    // Bot is currently following a target\n\
      \    // Perform actions specific to following state\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Following Logic
    code: "if (!botAI->IsFollowing()) {\n    // If not following, initiate follow\
      \ behavior\n    botAI->SetFollowTarget(targetUnit);\n} else {\n    // Bot is\
      \ already following, maybe adjust distance or target\n    botAI->UpdateFollowing();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the bot's AI system.
    It may not reflect real-time changes in movement if the bot's behavior is updated
    asynchronously. The implementation likely checks flags or state variables within
    the BotAI class that are set when a follow action begins and cleared when it ends.
