  method: ActivateToQuest
  signature: bool GameObject::ActivateToQuest(const int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Activates a game object for quest completion, returning true if successful.
  description: The ActivateToQuest method is used to trigger a game object's activation
    for quest-related purposes. This method typically occurs when a player interacts
    with a game object that has quest-related functionality, such as a quest-giver
    or quest objective item. The method returns true if the activation was successful
    and false otherwise, indicating whether the object's quest-related behavior was
    properly triggered. It is commonly used in conjunction with quest completion mechanics
    to ensure proper interaction with game objects during quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target quest ID or related
      identifier. This parameter specifies which quest should be activated through
      this game object.
  returns: Returns true if the game object activation was successful for the specified
    quest, false otherwise. The method may return false if the object is not properly
    configured for quest activation or if the target quest ID does not match the object's
    current quest state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Activation Example
    code: "GameObject* go = player->GetGameObject(\"quest_giver\");\nbool success\
      \ = go->ActivateToQuest(&questId);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Quest activation\
      \ successful\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely involves checking
    the object's quest state and triggering appropriate event handlers. Performance
    considerations include potential delays if multiple objects are being activated
    simultaneously. Thread safety is generally not an issue as long as the object
    state is properly synchronized.
  warnings: This method should only be used when a player has already started the
    relevant quest, or when the game object is configured to handle quest activation
    properly. Using this method on objects without proper quest configuration may
    lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
