  class: ThreatIntegrationExample
  method: SetupDungeonGroup
  signature: void ThreatIntegrationExample::SetupDungeonGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures a dungeon group for threat integration.
  description: The SetupDungeonGroup method prepares a Group object for use in dungeon
    scenarios with integrated threat management. It ensures that all group members
    are properly initialized with threat-related data structures, sets up appropriate
    threat rules based on dungeon difficulty, and configures the group's threat handling
    behavior to align with World of Warcraft's combat mechanics. This method is typically
    invoked when creating or joining a dungeon instance where threat management plays
    a crucial role in mob aggro and encounter progression.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that will be configured for dungeon threat
      integration. Must not be null and should represent an active group with valid
      members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic dungeon group setup
    code: 'Group* dungeonGroup = new Group();

      ThreatIntegrationExample threatManager;

      threatManager.SetupDungeonGroup(dungeonGroup);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setup with existing group
    code: 'Player* player1 = ...; // Player object

      Player* player2 = ...; // Player object

      Group* group = new Group();

      group->AddMember(player1, 0);

      group->AddMember(player2, 0);

      ThreatIntegrationExample threatManager;

      threatManager.SetupDungeonGroup(group);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Group object has already been initialized with
    valid members. The method does not perform any validation on the group's current
    state beyond ensuring it is not null. It may modify internal threat data structures
    of all group members, so calling this method on an active group during combat
    could lead to unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method on a group that is currently engaged in combat
    or has active threat interactions, as it may disrupt existing threat management
    systems. The method modifies the internal state of all group members and should
    only be used when setting up a new dungeon encounter.
