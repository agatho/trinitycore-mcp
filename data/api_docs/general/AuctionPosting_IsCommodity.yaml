  class: AuctionPosting
  method: IsCommodity
  signature: bool AuctionPosting::IsCommodity() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the auction posting represents a commodity item.
  description: The IsCommodity method checks if the auction posting is for a commodity
    item, which in World of Warcraft refers to items that are typically stackable
    and can be bought or sold in quantities greater than one. This method returns
    true if the item associated with the auction posting is classified as a commodity,
    such as herbs, ores, or other trade goods. It's commonly used in auction house
    logic to differentiate between regular items and commodities for pricing, stacking,
    and display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the auction posting represents a commodity item; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Auction Posting is a Commodity
    code: "AuctionPosting* posting = ...;\nif (posting->IsCommodity()) {\n    // Handle\
      \ commodity-specific logic\n    printf(\"This is a commodity item\\n\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle regular item logic\n    printf(\"This is a regular item\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal item flags or database fields to determine
    commodity status. It's part of the auction house system and may be used in conjunction
    with other methods like GetItemTemplate() to retrieve detailed item information.
