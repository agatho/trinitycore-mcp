  class: PlayerSocial
  method: GetPlayerGUID
  signature: const int & PlayerSocial::GetPlayerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player associated with this social
    list entry.
  description: The GetPlayerGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier for
    the player whose social data is stored in this PlayerSocial instance. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, GUIDs are used extensively to uniquely
    identify game objects including players, NPCs, items, and more. This particular
    method returns a constant reference to an integer representing the player's GUID,
    which can be used to look up or reference the player within the game world. The
    returned value is typically used in social interactions such as friend lists,
    ignore lists, and guild communications where player identification is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the player. This GUID is used internally by TrinityCore to uniquely identify
    this specific player instance throughout the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving a Player's GUID for Social Operations
    code: "PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();\nconst int& playerGUID = social->GetPlayerGUID();\n\
      // Use playerGUID to perform social operations\nif (playerGUID != 0) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with friend/ignore list operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal member variable, so the returned
    value should not be modified directly. The GUID is assigned when the player object
    is created and remains constant during the player's session. This method is commonly
    used in social system operations where player identification is needed without
    requiring additional database lookups.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this GUID for direct database queries or external
    systems, as it's specific to TrinityCore's internal ID management. The returned
    reference should not be stored long-term as the underlying object might be destroyed
    or reinitialized.
