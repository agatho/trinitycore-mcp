documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a cooldown should be aligned with Bloodlust for optimal
    performance.
  description: The ShouldAlignWithBloodlust method evaluates whether a specific cooldown
    ability should be timed to coincide with the Bloodlust buff to maximize its effectiveness.
    This decision is based on the duration of the cooldown and internal logic that
    considers the strategic value of using abilities during high-damage windows. The
    method does not take any parameters, as it relies on the class's internal state
    and configuration to make this determination. It returns true if alignment with
    Bloodlust is beneficial, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cooldown should be aligned with Bloodlust for optimal
    performance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (optimizer.ShouldAlignWithBloodlust(120000)) {\n    // Align cooldown\
      \ with Bloodlust\n    printf(\"Align cooldown with Bloodlust\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal cooldown tracking and buff management
    systems within TrinityCore. It may consider factors such as the ability's damage
    output, duration of the Bloodlust effect, and other strategic cooldowns to determine
    optimal timing.
