documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the NPC event object is in a consistent and usable state
  description: The IsValid method checks if the NPCEvent instance has been properly
    initialized and contains valid data. This method ensures that the event is not
    in an invalid or corrupted state, which could occur if the event was created but
    never fully configured, or if it has been destroyed or moved. The validation typically
    includes checking internal pointers, state flags, and ensuring all required fields
    have been set to meaningful values. This check is important before performing
    any operations on the NPCEvent object to prevent undefined behavior or crashes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the NPCEvent object is in a valid state and can be safely
    used; returns false if the object is invalid, uninitialized, or has been corrupted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (event.IsValid()) {\n    // Safe to use the event object\n    event.Execute();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid event case\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid NPC\
      \ event encountered\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Event Handler
    code: "void OnCreatureUpdate(Creature* creature, uint32 diff) {\n    if (creature->GetNPCEvent()\
      \ && creature->GetNPCEvent()->IsValid()) {\n        creature->GetNPCEvent()->Update(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a lightweight check that verifies
    the object's internal consistency without performing heavy operations. It may
    check for null pointers, valid state flags, or other basic integrity indicators.
    The exact implementation details depend on how NPCEvent objects are managed within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Calling methods on an invalid NPCEvent object can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate with IsValid() before performing operations that might
    access internal data members or execute event logic.
