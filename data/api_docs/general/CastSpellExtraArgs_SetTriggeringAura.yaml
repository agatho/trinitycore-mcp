  class: CastSpellExtraArgs
  method: SetTriggeringAura
  signature: CastSpellExtraArgs & CastSpellExtraArgs::SetTriggeringAura(const AuraEffect
    * triggeringAura)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the aura effect that triggered the spell cast.
  description: The SetTriggeringAura method assigns a pointer to an AuraEffect object
    that represents the aura which caused this spell to be cast. This is commonly
    used in spell processing logic to determine the source of a spell trigger, particularly
    when handling aura-based spell effects such as proc mechanics or triggered abilities.
    The method returns a reference to the CastSpellExtraArgs instance to allow for
    method chaining.
  parameters:
  - name: triggeringAura
    description: A pointer to the AuraEffect that initiated this spell cast. Can be
      null if no aura is responsible for triggering the spell.
  returns: Returns a reference to the CastSpellExtraArgs instance, enabling method
    chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Triggering Aura in Spell Logic
    code: 'AuraEffect const* aura = ...; // Some aura effect

      CastSpellExtraArgs args;

      args.SetTriggeringAura(aura);

      // Use args for spell casting logic'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining with SetTriggeringAura
    code: "CastSpellExtraArgs args;\nargs.SetTriggeringAura(someAura)\n    .SetCastFlags(CAST_FLAG_AURA_UPDATE);\n\
      // Further processing using args"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell triggering systems
    where the context of how a spell was initiated matters. It's important to ensure
    that the AuraEffect pointer passed is valid and not destroyed before the spell
    execution completes.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for triggeringAura may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect spell processing if downstream code assumes a valid aura is present.
    Always validate the aura pointer before calling this method in critical code paths.
