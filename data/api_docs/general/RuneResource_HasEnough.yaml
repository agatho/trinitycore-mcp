documentation:
  brief: Determines if a player has sufficient runes and runic power to cast a spell
    or ability
  description: The HasEnough method checks whether the RuneResource object contains
    enough blood, frost, unholy runes, and runic power to satisfy the requirements
    of a spell or ability. This method is typically used during spell casting validation
    to ensure the player has sufficient resources before proceeding with the action.
    The method evaluates all resource types together and returns true only if all
    requirements are met. It's an essential part of the combat system's resource management
    in World of Warcraft, particularly for Death Knights who rely heavily on rune-based
    abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: bloodRunes
    description: The number of blood runes required for the spell or ability
  - name: frostRunes
    description: The number of frost runes required for the spell or ability
  - name: unholyRunes
    description: The number of unholy runes required for the spell or ability
  - name: runicPowerCost
    description: The amount of runic power required for the spell or ability
  returns: Returns true if the RuneResource object has at least the specified number
    of blood runes, frost runes, unholy runes, and runic power; otherwise returns
    false
  examples:
  - title: Basic resource check before casting a spell
    code: "if (player->GetRuneResource()->HasEnough(1, 1, 0, 25)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can cast the spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_COIL, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough resources\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough\
      \ runes or runic power.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking resource requirements for a high-cost ability
    code: "RuneResource* runes = player->GetRuneResource();\nif (runes->HasEnough(2,\
      \ 1, 1, 50)) {\n    // Execute the powerful ability\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_BLOOD_BOIL, true);\n} else if (runes->HasEnough(1, 1, 1, 30)) {\n  \
      \  // Fallback to a less expensive version\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell validation in the TrinityCore
    combat system. It's important to note that this method does not consume runes
    or runic power - it only checks availability. The actual resource deduction happens
    in separate methods like RuneResource::Consume(). This method is thread-safe as
    long as the RuneResource object itself is properly synchronized.
  warnings: This method should not be used for actual resource consumption - always
    use dedicated resource deduction methods afterward. Be careful when checking for
    zero requirements, as this may indicate a spell that doesn't require any runes
    or runic power, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly
    in the calling code.
