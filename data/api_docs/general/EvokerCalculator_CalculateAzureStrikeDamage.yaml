  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateAzureStrikeDamage(int * caster, int *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the damage output of the Azure Strike spell for an evoker based
    on caster and target statistics.
  description: The CalculateAzureStrikeDamage method computes the total damage dealt
    by the Azure Strike ability, which is a primary spell for evokers in World of
    Warcraft. This calculation takes into account various factors including the caster's
    spell power, critical strike chance, and the target's resilience or mitigation
    stats. The method performs a detailed damage simulation that adheres to the game's
    combat system mechanics, ensuring realistic and balanced spell damage outcomes
    within the TrinityCore framework. It is designed to be used during spell casting
    events when the evoker's Azure Strike ability is executed against a target.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the caster's statistics, typically
      containing spell power and other relevant attributes needed for damage calculation.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's defensive statistics,
      including resilience and mitigation values that affect incoming damage.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated damage amount. A negative
    value may indicate an error or invalid input parameters, while zero typically
    means no damage was dealt due to full mitigation or other game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Azure Strike damage calculation
    code: 'int casterStats = 1500; // Spell power

      int targetStats = 800;   // Target resilience

      int damage = calculator->CalculateAzureStrikeDamage(&casterStats, &targetStats);

      // Damage value represents the computed Azure Strike effect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using calculated damage in combat system
    code: "int* caster = new int(2000); // High spell power\nint* target = new int(1200);\
      \  // Moderate resilience\nint result = calculator->CalculateAzureStrikeDamage(caster,\
      \ target);\nif (result > 0) {\n    target->health -= result; // Apply damage\
      \ to target\n}\ndelete caster;\ndelete target;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input parameters point to valid integer values
    representing the appropriate game statistics. The calculation logic is based on
    TrinityCore's spell damage formulas and may be subject to changes in balance updates.
    The method does not perform any validation of input data, so callers should ensure
    proper initialization of caster and target stats before invoking this function.
  warnings: Passing null pointers or uninitialized integer values to the parameters
    will result in undefined behavior. The method does not account for critical strikes
    or other special effects beyond base damage calculation; additional logic may
    be required for full spell simulation. Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical
    sections as it may involve multiple calculations.
