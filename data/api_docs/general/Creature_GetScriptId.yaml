  class: Creature
  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the script identifier associated with the creature for custom AI
    behavior implementation.
  description: The GetScriptId method retrieves the unique script ID assigned to a
    creature instance, which is used by the TrinityCore server to determine which
    custom AI script should be executed for that specific creature. This ID is typically
    set during creature spawning or initialization and allows developers to distinguish
    between different creature behaviors within the game world. The method serves
    as a key component in the scripting system where creature scripts are defined
    and managed through the database, enabling precise control over NPC behavior without
    modifying core code.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the script ID assigned to the creature
    instance. This ID corresponds to the 'ScriptId' field in the creature template
    table and is used to identify which custom AI script should be executed for this
    particular creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 scriptId = creature->GetScriptId();\nif (scriptId == 12345)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    should be used carefully as script IDs are typically set during creature initialization,
    and changing them at runtime may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect AI execution.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method on creatures that have not yet been initialized
    with a script ID; the returned value may be zero if no script has been assigned.
    Also note that script IDs are not guaranteed to be unique across different instances
    of the same creature type, so care must be taken when implementing logic based
    on these values.
