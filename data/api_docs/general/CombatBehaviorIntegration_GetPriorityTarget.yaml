  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetPriorityTarget
  signature: Unit * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetPriorityTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current priority target for the combat behavior integration.
  description: The GetPriorityTarget method returns a pointer to the Unit object that
    is currently designated as the priority target within the combat behavior integration.
    This target is typically the most threatening or highest-priority enemy that the
    AI should focus on engaging. The method does not perform any target selection
    logic itself but simply retrieves the already determined priority target from
    internal state. This is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to ensure
    that the creature prioritizes its attacks appropriately based on threat levels,
    aggro, or other combat conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Unit object representing the current priority target, or
    nullptr if no valid target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = combatBehavior->GetPriorityTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with attack logic against the priority target\n    me->Attack(target,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Target Validity Before Action
    code: "Unit* priorityTarget = combatBehavior->GetPriorityTarget();\nif (priorityTarget\
      \ && priorityTarget->IsAlive() && !priorityTarget->HasFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_NON_ATTACKABLE))\n{\n    // Ensure target is valid before casting\
      \ spell or attacking\n    if (me->IsValidAttackTarget(priorityTarget))\n   \
      \ {\n        me->CastSpell(priorityTarget, SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the priority target has already been calculated
    and set by the combat behavior system. It is recommended to check for nullptr
    before using the returned Unit pointer to avoid potential crashes or undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Using this method without verifying that the returned Unit pointer is
    valid may lead to null pointer dereferences. Always validate the return value
    before accessing target properties or calling methods on it.
