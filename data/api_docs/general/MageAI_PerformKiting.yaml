documentation:
  brief: Performs kiting behavior for a Mage AI, maintaining optimal distance from
    target while casting spells.
  description: The PerformKiting method implements the kiting behavior for a Mage
    AI, which is a fundamental combat strategy where the mage maintains a safe distance
    from its target while continuously casting spells. This method evaluates the current
    distance between the mage and its target unit, determines if kiting movement is
    necessary, and executes appropriate movement and spell casting actions to maintain
    optimal positioning. The method typically involves checking if the target is within
    melee range, calculating the required retreat distance, moving away from the target,
    and casting spells that can be cast while moving or at range. This behavior is
    crucial for Mage players who need to manage their positioning carefully to avoid
    melee attacks while dealing damage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target enemy that the
      mage is kiting against. Must be a valid unit pointer, typically an opponent
      in combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PerformKiting
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    if (target)\n    {\n   \
      \     PerformKiting(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell casting during kiting
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n     \
      \   return;\n\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    if (target)\n    {\n   \
      \     // Check if we should kite\n        if (me->GetDistance(target) < 8.0f)\n\
      \        {\n            PerformKiting(target);\n        }\n        else\n  \
      \      {\n            // Cast appropriate spells when not kiting\n         \
      \   DoCast(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop of a Mage creature
    or player. The implementation likely includes checks for spell cooldowns, line-of-sight
    to target, and movement restrictions. It may also consider the mage's current
    mana levels and spell priorities when determining which spells to cast during
    kiting.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target parameter is valid and not null. Calling
    this method without a proper target can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Additionally, the kiting logic might conflict with other AI behaviors if not properly
    coordinated within the overall AI state machine.
