  class: GuildIntegration
  method: OptimizeGuildBankUsage
  signature: void GuildIntegration::OptimizeGuildBankUsage(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes guild bank usage by redistributing items to maximize space efficiency
    and minimize waste.
  description: The OptimizeGuildBankUsage method is designed to enhance the efficiency
    of a guild's bank storage system. It analyzes the current item distribution within
    the guild bank, identifies underutilized or redundant slots, and reorganizes items
    to ensure optimal use of available space. This process may involve moving items
    between different tabs or containers, sorting by item type or rarity, and potentially
    removing obsolete items if configured to do so. The method operates on a per-player
    basis, using the provided player reference to determine which guild bank operations
    are permitted and how to prioritize item movements. It is typically invoked during
    maintenance periods or when specific conditions such as low storage space or high
    item turnover are detected.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who initiated the optimization request. This parameter ensures that only
      authorized guild members can trigger this operation, and it helps track which
      player performed the action for logging or audit purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.OptimizeGuildBankUsage(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nGuildIntegration guildInt;\nif (playerId > 0) {\n\
      \    guildInt.OptimizeGuildBankUsage(&playerId);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ player ID\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid player ID provided for guild bank\
      \ optimization\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may temporarily lock the guild bank during execution to prevent
    concurrent modifications. It is recommended to call this function during low-traffic
    periods to minimize impact on gameplay. The actual optimization algorithm depends
    on internal configuration settings and may vary based on server-specific rules.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unauthorized player ID can lead
    to unexpected behavior or access violations. Ensure that the player pointer points
    to a valid, authenticated guild member before invoking this function.
