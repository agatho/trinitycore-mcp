  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: RecognitionMetrics PlayerPatternRecognition::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the pattern recognition metrics for the player
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a RecognitionMetrics structure containing
    detailed statistics and performance data related to the player's pattern recognition
    capabilities. This includes information such as recognition accuracy, processing
    time, and success rates for various pattern types. The returned metrics are typically
    used for debugging, performance analysis, or game balance adjustments within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A RecognitionMetrics object containing comprehensive data about the player's
    pattern recognition performance, including accuracy percentages, timing measurements,
    and success/failure counts for different recognition scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RecognitionMetrics metrics = playerPatternRecognition.GetMetrics();

      uint32 accuracy = metrics.accuracy;

      uint32 processingTime = metrics.averageProcessingTime;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "const RecognitionMetrics& metrics = playerPatternRecognition.GetMetrics();\n\
      if (metrics.successRate < 0.75f)\n{\n    // Log low recognition performance\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player pattern recognition below threshold: %f\", metrics.successRate);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during gameplay analysis or debugging sessions.
    The returned metrics may be updated dynamically as the player interacts with pattern
    recognition systems in the game world.
