  class: FrostDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ConsumeRunicPower
  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::ConsumeRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of runic power from the Frost Death Knight's
    resource pool.
  description: The ConsumeRunicPower method reduces the current runic power of a Frost
    Death Knight by the specified amount. This method is typically invoked when abilities
    or spells that require runic power are executed. The consumption is handled internally,
    ensuring that the player's runic power does not drop below zero. It is an essential
    part of managing resource usage for Death Knights in the Frost specialization,
    particularly for abilities like Howling Blast and Obliterate which consume runic
    power.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to be consumed from the Death Knight's
      current resource pool. Must be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Runic Power Consumption
    code: 'FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunicPower(10);

      // Consumes 10 runic power from the Death Knight''s resource pool.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Runic Power Before Spell Cast
    code: "FrostDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;\nif (dk->GetRunicPower() >= 25)\n\
      {\n    dk->ConsumeRunicPower(25);\n    // Proceed with spell casting that requires\
      \ 25 runic power\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal runic power state of the Death
    Knight. It is expected to be called only after verifying that sufficient runic
    power exists to avoid negative values. The method does not trigger any visual
    or auditory feedback; it solely updates the resource value.
  warnings: Calling this method with an amount greater than the current runic power
    will result in undefined behavior or potential crashes if not properly validated
    beforehand. Always ensure that the Death Knight has sufficient runic power before
    calling this method.
