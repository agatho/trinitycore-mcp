  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::TargetIconChanged(int groupGuid, uint8 icon, int
    targetGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a GroupEvent indicating that a target icon has been changed within
    a group
  description: The TargetIconChanged method generates a GroupEvent object that represents
    a change in the target icon assigned to a specific group member. This event is
    typically used in World of Warcraft's group management system to notify clients
    and systems when a player's role or target marker (such as raid icons) has been
    updated. The method takes the group GUID, the new icon index, and the target player's
    GUID as parameters to construct the event. This functionality supports raid coordination
    features where players assign special markers to targets for easier identification
    during group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group where the icon change occurred.
      This identifies which specific group is affected by the event.
  - name: icon
    description: The new target icon index that was assigned to the target. Valid
      values are typically 0-7 representing different raid icons (none, skull, cross,
      etc.).
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose target icon has
      been changed. This identifies which specific group member's icon was modified.
  returns: A GroupEvent object representing the target icon change event, containing
    all relevant information about the modification for further processing or broadcasting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of TargetIconChanged
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::TargetIconChanged(12345, 3, 67890);

      // This creates an event indicating that player with GUID 67890 in group 12345
      has had their target icon changed to icon 3 (e.g., a triangle)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing the TargetIconChanged event
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::TargetIconChanged(54321, 7, 98765);

      // Broadcast this event to all group members

      WorldPacket data(SMSG_RAID_TARGET_UPDATE);

      data << uint8(1); // Update single target

      data << int32(event.GetTargetGuid());

      data << uint8(event.GetIcon());

      gameMaster->SendPacketToGroup(event.GetGroupGuid(), &data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's group event system and should be
    used in conjunction with proper group management functions. The icon parameter
    typically follows World of Warcraft's standard raid target icon system (0 = none,
    1 = skull, 2 = cross, etc.). The returned GroupEvent object can be queued for
    later processing or immediately broadcast to the appropriate clients.
  warnings: Ensure that the group GUID and target GUID are valid before calling this
    method. Invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior in the group management system.
    Also note that icon values outside the standard range (0-7) may not display correctly
    in client interfaces.
