  class: AuctionHouseObject
  method: GetAuctionsEnd
  signature: int AuctionHouseObject::GetAuctionsEnd()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the end time of auctions managed by the auction house object.
  description: The GetAuctionsEnd method returns the timestamp indicating when the
    current set of auctions will expire or end. This value is typically used to determine
    auction durations and manage auction lifecycle events within the auction house
    system. The returned value represents a Unix timestamp in seconds since epoch,
    which can be compared against the current time to calculate remaining auction
    duration or trigger end-of-auction processing. This method is commonly called
    during auction house updates or when checking auction status for players.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) when the
    auctions managed by this auction house object will end. Returns 0 if no auctions
    are active or if the auction house has not been initialized with valid auction
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Auction End Time
    code: "AuctionHouseObject* ah = sAuctionMgr->GetAuctionHouse(12345);\nif (ah)\n\
      {\n    int endTime = ah->GetAuctionsEnd();\n    if (endTime > 0)\n    {\n  \
      \      time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);\n        printf(\"Auctions end in\
      \ %ld seconds\\n\", endTime - currentTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the auction house system to manage
    auction expiration logic. The returned timestamp may be cached or updated periodically,
    so calling this method multiple times in quick succession might return the same
    value unless auction data has changed. Developers should not rely on this method
    for real-time auction status updates without considering potential caching behavior.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value is a Unix timestamp and represents absolute
    time. If your application requires relative time calculations, ensure proper conversion
    from absolute to relative time. Also, always verify that the AuctionHouseObject
    instance is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
