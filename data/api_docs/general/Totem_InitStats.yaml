  class: Totem
  method: InitStats
  signature: void Totem::InitStats(int * summoner, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the statistics and properties of a totem based on the summoner's
    level and specified duration.
  description: The InitStats method configures the initial attributes and behavior
    of a Totem object, typically called during the creation or summoning process.
    It sets up the totem's health, damage, and other relevant stats according to the
    summoner's level and the provided duration. This method ensures that the totem
    behaves appropriately within the game mechanics, scaling its stats relative to
    the caster's power while respecting the specified time limit for its existence.
    The method is usually invoked internally by the core system when a player casts
    a totem spell, ensuring proper initialization before the totem becomes active
    in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the summoner's level or power
      attribute. This value is used to scale the totem's stats accordingly.
  - name: duration
    description: Integer specifying the duration in milliseconds for which the totem
      will remain active. Used to set up the totem's lifetime and expiration logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Totem Initialization
    code: 'int playerLevel = 60;

      int totemDuration = 120000; // 2 minutes

      Totem* myTotem = new Totem();

      myTotem->InitStats(&playerLevel, totemDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the totem's construction or summoning
    sequence and should not be invoked after the totem has been placed in the world.
    The stats initialized by this method are generally fixed at creation time and
    do not dynamically update based on changes in the summoner's level.
  warnings: Calling InitStats multiple times on the same totem instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect stat assignment. Ensure that this method is only
    called once during the totem's lifecycle, preferably right after instantiation.
