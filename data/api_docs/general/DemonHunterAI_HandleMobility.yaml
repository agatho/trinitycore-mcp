  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: HandleMobility
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::HandleMobility(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles mobility mechanics for a demon hunter AI unit, updating target position
    and movement behavior.
  description: The HandleMobility method in DemonHunterAI manages the movement and
    positioning logic for a demon hunter AI-controlled unit. It adjusts the AI's target
    based on mobility considerations such as distance, threat level, or environmental
    factors. This method is typically invoked during combat to ensure optimal positioning
    and engagement with targets. The implementation likely evaluates the current target's
    location and determines whether repositioning or movement adjustments are necessary
    for effective gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target index or identifier
      used by the AI for mobility calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        HandleMobility(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's movement system to ensure proper
    positioning during combat. It may be called frequently during combat updates and
    should not block execution for extended periods.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before passing it to this method,
    as dereferencing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
