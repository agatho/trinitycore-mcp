documentation:
  brief: Initializes the warrior baseline rotation behavior for the player's combat
    routine.
  description: The InitializeWarriorBaseline method sets up and configures the default
    rotation logic specific to warrior classes within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method is responsible for establishing the foundational combat behavior, including
    ability prioritization, cooldown management, and resource tracking tailored for
    warrior players. It typically runs during character initialization or when switching
    to a warrior specialization, ensuring that the AI or player's combat decisions
    follow established baseline strategies. The method does not require any input
    parameters and performs internal setup operations to prepare the warrior's rotation
    manager for active use in combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.InitializeWarriorBaseline();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per warrior character instance during
    initialization. It is typically invoked automatically by the core system when
    a warrior enters combat or when the rotation manager is first instantiated.
