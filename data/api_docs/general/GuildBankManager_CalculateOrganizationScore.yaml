  class: GuildBankManager

  signature: float GuildBankManager::CalculateOrganizationScore(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the organizational score for a guild based on its
    bank management efficiency.
  description: The CalculateOrganizationScore method computes a numerical representation
    of how efficiently a guild manages its bank resources. This score is typically
    derived from factors such as item distribution, usage patterns, and overall organization
    within the guild's bank system. The method takes no parameters and operates on
    the internal state of the GuildBankManager instance to determine this metric.
    It serves as a utility for evaluating guild performance in terms of resource management
    and may be used for ranking, rewards, or administrative purposes within the game
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated organizational score. Higher
    scores indicate better organization and efficiency in guild bank management. The
    exact scale and interpretation may depend on internal game logic and balance considerations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float score = guildBankManager->CalculateOrganizationScore(nullptr);

      printf("Guild Organization Score: %.2f\n", score);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving item counts, rarity distributions,
    and possibly player activity within the guild bank. It may cache results for performance
    optimization or be called frequently during guild evaluations.
