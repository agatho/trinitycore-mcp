documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of top contributors to a guild bank
  description: The GetTopContributors method calculates and returns the count of players
    who have made the most significant contributions to a specified guild's bank.
    This method is typically used in conjunction with guild banking mechanics to track
    player engagement and rewards. The calculation may consider items deposited, gold
    contributed, or other relevant metrics depending on the implementation. It assumes
    that the guild ID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing guild in the
    database.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total count of top contributors for the specified
    guild. Returns 0 if no contributors are found or if the guild does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 guildId = 12345;\nint contributorCount = guildBankManager->GetTopContributors(guildId);\n\
      if (contributorCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << contributorCount\
      \ << \" top contributors in the guild bank.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database queries to aggregate contribution data
    for a given guild. It may cache results or perform calculations based on stored
    transaction logs. The exact definition of 'top contributor' should be verified
    in the implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    guild; otherwise, the method might return unexpected results or cause errors.
    This method may have performance implications if called frequently without caching.
