documentation:
  brief: Updates the trade data for a player or their trading partner.
  description: The Update method synchronizes the current state of trade data between
    the player and their trading partner. It is typically called when a trade item
    is added, removed, or modified during a trade session. The 'for_trader' parameter
    determines whether the update is sent to the trader (true) or the other party
    in the trade (false). This method ensures that both parties in the trade have
    consistent information about the items being traded and the overall state of the
    trade.
  parameters:
  - name: for_trader
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to update the trader's view (true)
      or the other party's view (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update trade data for the trader
    code: 'TradeData* tradeData = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeData->Update(true); // Update trader''s view'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update trade data for the trading partner
    code: 'TradeData* tradeData = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeData->Update(false); // Update partner''s view'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the trade system when changes
    occur in a trade session. It may trigger network packets to be sent to both players
    involved in the trade, ensuring synchronization of trade state across the game
    world.
