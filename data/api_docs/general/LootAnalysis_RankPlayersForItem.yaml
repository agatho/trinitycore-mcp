  class: LootAnalysis
  method: RankPlayersForItem
  signature: int LootAnalysis::RankPlayersForItem(Group * group, const LootItem &
    item)
documentation:
  brief: Ranks players in a group for a specific loot item based on their eligibility
    and priority.
  description: The RankPlayersForItem method evaluates all members of a given group
    to determine their ranking for receiving a specific loot item. It considers factors
    such as loot distribution rules, player eligibility, and group composition. The
    method assigns a rank value to each eligible player that can be used to determine
    the order in which they should receive the item. This is typically used during
    group loot distribution processes where items are awarded based on priority or
    need rather than random chance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who may receive the
      loot item. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the specific item
      being distributed. Contains information about the item's properties and distribution
      rules.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of players successfully
    ranked for the item. A return value of 0 indicates no eligible players were found,
    while a positive value represents the count of ranked players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot distribution
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nLootItem item;\n// Initialize item\
      \ with relevant data\nint rankedCount = LootAnalysis::RankPlayersForItem(group,\
      \ item);\nif (rankedCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with ranked loot distribution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned rank count for further processing
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nLootItem item;\n// Initialize item\
      \ with relevant data\nint rankedPlayers = LootAnalysis::RankPlayersForItem(group,\
      \ item);\nif (rankedPlayers > 0)\n{\n    // Process the ranked players for loot\
      \ assignment\n    for (uint8 i = 0; i < rankedPlayers; ++i)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Assign loot based on rank\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where\
      \ no players are eligible\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and item parameters are properly initialized
    and valid. The ranking algorithm may consider factors such as player class, specialization,
    gear level, and existing loot in the player's inventory. Performance is optimized
    for typical group sizes but may degrade with very large groups.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is not null before calling this method.
    The method does not validate item data integrity, so invalid or corrupted LootItem
    structures may lead to unexpected behavior. This method should only be called
    during active loot distribution phases to avoid conflicts with other systems.
