  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: EvaluateProfileActivation
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::EvaluateProfileActivation(BehaviorProfile
    & profile, const CombatMetrics & metrics, CombatSituation situation)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a behavior profile should be activated based on combat
    metrics and situation.
  description: The EvaluateProfileActivation method determines if a given BehaviorProfile
    should be triggered or activated based on current combat conditions and metrics.
    This method is typically used within the adaptive AI system to dynamically adjust
    NPC behavior in response to changing battlefield scenarios. It analyzes input
    parameters such as combat metrics and situational context to make decisions about
    profile activation. The method does not return any value but may modify internal
    state or trigger behavior changes within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to the BehaviorProfile object that will be evaluated for
      activation. This profile contains predefined behaviors and conditions that determine
      when it should be active.
  - name: metrics
    description: CombatMetrics object containing real-time combat data such as health
      percentages, threat levels, damage dealt/received, and other relevant statistics
      used to evaluate profile activation.
  - name: situation
    description: CombatSituation enum value representing the current tactical context
      of the encounter. This helps determine how the profile should be interpreted
      or applied based on the overall combat state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Activation Evaluation
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager manager;

      BehaviorProfile profile;

      CombatMetrics metrics;

      CombatSituation situation = CombatSituation::ENGAGED;


      manager.EvaluateProfileActivation(profile, metrics, situation);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Dynamic Combat Data
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager manager;

      BehaviorProfile profile;

      CombatMetrics metrics;

      metrics.healthPercentage = 30.0f;

      metrics.threatLevel = ThreatLevel::HIGH;

      CombatSituation situation = CombatSituation::RETREATING;


      manager.EvaluateProfileActivation(profile, metrics, situation);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI framework and should be called regularly
    during combat updates to ensure dynamic behavior adjustment. The evaluation process
    may involve complex logic that considers multiple factors from the provided metrics
    and situation data.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are properly initialized before calling
    this method, as invalid or uninitialized data could lead to unpredictable behavior
    in profile activation decisions.
