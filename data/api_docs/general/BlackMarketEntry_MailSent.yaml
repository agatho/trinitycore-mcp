  method: MailSent
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::MailSent()
documentation:
  brief: Marks a black market item as having been sent via mail to the bidder.
  description: The MailSent method is used to update the state of a BlackMarketEntry
    to indicate that the item associated with the entry has been successfully delivered
    to the bidder via in-game mail. This method is typically invoked after the system
    has processed the auction outcome and prepared the item delivery. It ensures that
    the black market entry is not reprocessed for mail delivery, preventing duplicate
    item distributions. The method does not perform any direct mail sending; instead,
    it updates internal state flags to reflect that the mail sending process has been
    completed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Black Market Entry as Mailed
    code: "BlackMarketEntry* entry = sBlackMarketMgr->GetBlackMarketEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    entry->MailSent();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the item has been
    properly prepared for delivery via mail. It is an internal state management function
    and does not directly interact with the mail system or database.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring proper item preparation may lead
    to inconsistent state where the entry is marked as mailed but no actual item was
    sent, potentially causing confusion for players.
