  class: LFGMgr
  method: ClearState
  signature: void LFGMgr::ClearState(int guid, const char * debugMsg)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the LFG state for a specific player GUID.
  description: The ClearState method resets the Looking For Group (LFG) state associated
    with a given player identifier. This function is typically invoked when a player's
    LFG participation needs to be terminated or reset, such as during logout, zoning,
    or when transitioning between different LFG activities. It ensures that any pending
    LFG data or status for the specified player is cleared from memory, preventing
    stale or incorrect information from persisting in the system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG state should
      be cleared. This value represents the internal game object identifier for a
      specific player character.
  - name: debugMsg
    description: An optional debug message string that can be used to log or trace
      the clearing operation. This parameter is typically used for debugging purposes
      and may not affect functionality in release builds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear LFG state for a player
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->ClearState(playerGuid, "Player logging out");
    language: cpp
  - title: Clear LFG state with debug logging
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->ClearState(123456, "Resetting LFG after dungeon completion");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system management and should be called
    carefully to avoid unintended side effects. It does not directly interact with
    the database but modifies in-memory structures related to player LFG status.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the GUID may lead to
    undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds
    to an active player session before invoking this function.
