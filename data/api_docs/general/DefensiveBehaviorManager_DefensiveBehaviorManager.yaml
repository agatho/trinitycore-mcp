  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  signature: void DefensiveBehaviorManager::DefensiveBehaviorManager(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DefensiveBehaviorManager instance with the specified BotAI
    context.
  description: The DefensiveBehaviorManager constructor initializes a defensive behavior
    manager object that is responsible for handling AI-driven defensive actions within
    the TrinityCore framework. This manager integrates with the provided BotAI instance
    to determine and execute appropriate defensive strategies based on the bot's current
    state, health, threat level, and surrounding environment. It sets up internal
    state tracking mechanisms and registers necessary event handlers to respond to
    combat-related triggers. The initialization process ensures that all required
    resources are allocated and configured for effective defensive behavior execution.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this defensive behavior manager
      will operate with. Must not be null, as the manager requires access to AI context
      information including player state, combat status, and available abilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Defensive Behavior Manager Initialization
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = new BotAI(player);

      DefensiveBehaviorManager defManager(botAI);

      // The defensive behavior manager is now initialized and ready to handle defensive
      actions'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor performs essential setup operations including initializing
    internal state variables, setting up callback functions for combat events, and
    preparing resource pools needed for defensive decision-making. It's important
    to ensure that the BotAI pointer passed is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null BotAI pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always verify that the BotAI instance exists and is fully constructed
    before creating a DefensiveBehaviorManager instance.
