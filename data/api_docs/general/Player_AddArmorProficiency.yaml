documentation:
  brief: Adds armor proficiency to the player character.
  description: This method adds a specified armor proficiency flag to the player's
    list of known armor proficiencies. It is used to grant the player access to specific
    types of armor, such as cloth, leather, mail, or plate armor. The method typically
    affects gameplay mechanics related to character progression and equipment usage,
    particularly when the player gains access to new armor types through class abilities
    or talent points. This function does not directly affect the player's ability
    to equip armor but rather adds the proficiency flag to their list of valid armor
    types.
  parameters:
  - name: newflag
    description: The armor proficiency flag to be added, representing a specific type
      of armor (cloth, leather, mail, or plate). This value corresponds to the armor
      type enum values used in the game's internal system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Add Cloth Armor Proficiency
    code: player->AddArmorProficiency(1); // Adds cloth armor proficiency
    language: cpp
  - title: Add Plate Armor Proficiency
    code: player->AddArmorProficiency(4); // Adds plate armor proficiency
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during character progression or when implementing
    class abilities that grant new armor proficiencies. It should be called in a context
    where the player's armor proficiency list needs to be updated, such as when gaining
    access to new armor types through talents or class features.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect the player's ability to equip armor;
    it only adds the flag to their list of valid armor proficiencies. Be cautious
    about calling this method in contexts where the player might already have the
    armor type, as it could lead to redundant or incorrect updates.
