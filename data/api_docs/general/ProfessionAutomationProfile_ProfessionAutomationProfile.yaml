documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ProfessionAutomationProfile class with
    default settings.
  description: The ProfessionAutomationProfile constructor initializes a new automation
    profile for crafting professions within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    sets up internal data structures and default configuration values required for
    automating crafting tasks such as mining, herbalism, or blacksmithing. The profile
    can be customized later with specific parameters to define which skills to automate,
    how often to check for resources, and what actions to perform when conditions
    are met. This constructor is typically called when creating a new automation script
    or module that requires profession-based automation functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a New Profession Automation Profile
    code: 'ProfessionAutomationProfile profile;

      // The profile is now initialized with default settings

      // Ready to be configured for specific automation tasks'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any I/O operations or network calls. It
    only initializes internal state variables and data structures. The actual automation
    behavior must be configured through additional methods after construction.
