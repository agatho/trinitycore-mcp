  method: GetProfessionSkill
  signature: uint16 GatheringManager::GetProfessionSkill(GatheringNodeType nodeType)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill level of the player's gathering profession for a specified
    node type.
  description: The GetProfessionSkill method returns the current skill level of the
    player's primary gathering profession (such as Mining, Herbalism, or Skinning)
    associated with a specific node type. This value is typically used to determine
    the success rate of gathering resources from nodes, the quality of items obtained,
    and whether the player can gather certain rare or high-level materials. The method
    does not take any parameters and relies on internal state tracking of the player's
    profession skills. It is commonly called during gathering operations to assess
    the player's capability to extract resources from various world objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the current skill level of the player's gathering
    profession for the specified node type. This value typically ranges from 0 to
    700 for standard professions, with higher values indicating greater proficiency
    and access to better resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint16 skill = gatheringManager->GetProfessionSkill(GatheringNodeType::MINING);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Skill for Herbalism
    code: "if (gatheringManager->GetProfessionSkill(GatheringNodeType::HERBALISM)\
      \ >= 300)\n{\n    // Player can gather rare herbs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has a valid gathering profession associated
    with the node type. The skill level returned is typically updated through in-game
    activities such as mining nodes, herbalism plants, or skinning creatures. It may
    also be affected by buffs, talents, and other game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the GatheringManager instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized object could lead to undefined
    behavior. The returned skill level should not be directly modified without proper
    validation and update mechanisms.
