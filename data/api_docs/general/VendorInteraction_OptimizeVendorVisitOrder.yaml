api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: OptimizeVendorVisitOrder
  signature: void VendorInteraction::OptimizeVendorVisitOrder(Player * player, int
    & vendorGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the order in which a player visits vendors to minimize travel time
    and maximize efficiency.
  description: The OptimizeVendorVisitOrder method calculates an optimized sequence
    for visiting multiple vendors within a player's current zone or area. This method
    is typically used by automated systems or addon scripts to reduce the time spent
    traveling between vendor locations. It considers factors such as vendor proximity,
    player movement speed, and potential item availability. The optimization algorithm
    attempts to minimize total travel distance and time while ensuring all required
    vendors are visited. This functionality is particularly useful for players engaging
    in repetitive vendor activities like selling loot or purchasing consumables.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the vendor visit order is being
      optimized. Must not be null.
  - name: vendorGuids
    description: Reference to an integer that will store the GUIDs of vendors in the
      optimized visit order. The value represents a bitmask or list identifier for
      multiple vendor entries.
  returns: None. This method modifies the vendorGuids parameter directly and does
    not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Optimization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      int vendorGuids = 0;

      vendorInteraction->OptimizeVendorVisitOrder(player, vendorGuids);

      // vendorGuids now contains the optimized vendor visit order'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all vendors are within the same zone or accessible
    area. The actual optimization algorithm may vary based on server configuration
    and player location data. Performance impact is minimal as it only processes known
    vendor locations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent segmentation faults. The vendorGuids parameter should be initialized appropriately
    before use.
