  method: RecordSuccess
  signature: void SpawnCircuitBreaker::RecordSuccess()
documentation:
  brief: Records a successful spawn event in the circuit breaker mechanism
  description: The RecordSuccess method updates the internal state of the SpawnCircuitBreaker
    to indicate that a spawn operation has completed successfully. This method is
    typically called after a successful creature or game object spawn attempt to track
    the success rate and determine whether the circuit breaker should be reset or
    remain active. The circuit breaker mechanism helps prevent excessive spawning
    attempts during high-load scenarios or when spawn points are temporarily unavailable.
    This method does not perform any validation checks on the spawn status itself,
    as it assumes the caller has already verified the successful completion of the
    spawn operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Handler
    code: "void HandleCreatureSpawn(Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature)\n  \
      \  {\n        // ... spawn logic ...\n        sSpawnCircuitBreaker->RecordSuccess();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other circuit breaker methods
    such as RecordFailure() and IsTripped(). The internal state tracking may involve
    counters or time-based thresholds to determine circuit breaker behavior. This
    method should only be called after confirming a successful spawn operation to
    maintain accurate statistics.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the spawn actually succeeded
    may lead to incorrect circuit breaker state, potentially causing unnecessary restrictions
    on future spawn attempts or false positives in failure detection.
