  signature: void TransportBase::TransportBase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the TransportBase class with default values.
  description: The TransportBase constructor initializes a new transport entity within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the internal state and data members
    required for managing transport objects such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving
    platforms in Azeroth. It ensures that all necessary variables are properly initialized
    before the transport can be used in the game world. The constructor typically
    handles memory allocation, default value assignments, and prepares the object
    for integration with the server's transport system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new TransportBase instance
    code: 'TransportBase* transport = new TransportBase();

      // The transport is now initialized and ready for use in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore server
    when loading or creating transport entities. Developers should not directly instantiate
    TransportBase objects unless implementing custom transport logic. The class likely
    inherits from a base entity class and requires proper initialization before being
    added to the world.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of TransportBase should be avoided in most cases
    as it's intended to be used through the server's transport management system.
    Improper use may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks if not properly integrated
    with the game's object lifecycle management.
