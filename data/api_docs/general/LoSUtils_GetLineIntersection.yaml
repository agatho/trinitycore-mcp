  class: LoSUtils
  method: GetLineIntersection
  signature: int LoSUtils::GetLineIntersection(const int & line1Start, const int &
    line1End, const int & line2Start, const int & line2End)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the intersection point of two line segments and returns a status
    code indicating success or failure.
  description: The GetLineIntersection method determines whether two line segments
    intersect in 2D space. It takes four parameters representing the start and end
    points of each line segment, computes their intersection, and returns an integer
    status code. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this utility is commonly
    used for line-of-sight calculations, spell targeting, and collision detection
    between game objects. The method performs geometric computations to determine
    if lines cross and can be used to validate whether a character can see another
    object or if a projectile will hit its target. This function is essential for
    maintaining accurate gameplay mechanics involving visibility and targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: line1Start
    description: The starting point of the first line segment, represented as an integer
      coordinate value
  - name: line1End
    description: The ending point of the first line segment, represented as an integer
      coordinate value
  - name: line2Start
    description: The starting point of the second line segment, represented as an
      integer coordinate value
  - name: line2End
    description: The ending point of the second line segment, represented as an integer
      coordinate value
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 indicates no intersection, 1 indicates
    a single intersection point, and 2 indicates that the lines are collinear with
    overlapping segments. Negative values may indicate invalid input parameters or
    computational errors.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line Intersection Test
    code: 'int result = LoSUtils::GetLineIntersection(0, 10, 5, 15);

      // Tests if line from (0,0) to (10,0) intersects with line from (5,0) to (15,0)

      // Returns 1 indicating a single intersection point'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for No Intersection
    code: 'int result = LoSUtils::GetLineIntersection(0, 5, 10, 15);

      // Tests if line from (0,0) to (5,0) intersects with line from (10,0) to (15,0)

      // Returns 0 indicating no intersection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes integer coordinate values for simplicity in game environments.
    The implementation likely uses a standard computational geometry algorithm such
    as the orientation test or parametric line equations. Performance is optimized
    for frequent calls during AI processing and spell casting, but may be impacted
    by very large coordinate differences. The function does not handle floating-point
    precision issues directly, so it's recommended to use integer-based coordinates
    for consistent behavior.
  warnings: The method may produce inaccurate results with floating-point inputs due
    to integer arithmetic assumptions. Be cautious when using with very large coordinate
    values that could cause overflow during intermediate calculations. The return
    value interpretation should be carefully handled as different codes represent
    different intersection scenarios.
