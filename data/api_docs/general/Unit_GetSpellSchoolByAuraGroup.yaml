  method: GetSpellSchoolByAuraGroup
  signature: int Unit::GetSpellSchoolByAuraGroup(UnitMods unitMod) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell school associated with a specific aura group for the
    unit.
  description: This method returns the spell school value corresponding to the specified
    aura group within the unit's mod system. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework to determine the magical school of a particular aura effect,
    such as those related to spell damage or resistance. The method operates on the
    unit's internal mod structure and provides access to spell school information
    based on the aura group identifier passed as parameter. This functionality is
    essential for calculating spell effects, determining spell interactions, and managing
    various game mechanics involving magical schools.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the spell school associated with the specified
    aura group. The value corresponds to one of the possible spell school types (fire,
    frost, nature, etc.) as defined by the game's spell school system, with values
    typically ranging from 0 to 6 for different schools.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int school = unit->GetSpellSchoolByAuraGroup(UnitMods::UNIT_MOD_MANA);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class's internal mod system and should be
    used carefully when dealing with spell effects or magical school calculations.
    It may involve performance considerations when called frequently during combat
    or spell processing.
  warnings: The method may return invalid values if the aura group specified does
    not correspond to a valid spell school, potentially leading to incorrect spell
    calculations or game mechanics behavior. Care should be taken when using this
    method in conjunction with other mod-related methods.
