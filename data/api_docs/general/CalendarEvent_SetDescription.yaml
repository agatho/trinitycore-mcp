documentation:
  brief: Sets the description text for a calendar event
  description: The SetDescription method assigns a new description string to a CalendarEvent
    object. This description is typically displayed in the game's calendar interface
    when players view event details. The method directly modifies the internal state
    of the calendar event, updating its textual description field. No validation is
    performed on the input string, so developers should ensure proper sanitization
    if needed. This method is commonly used when creating or modifying events through
    the TrinityCore API.
  parameters:
  - name: description
    description: The new description text to assign to the calendar event. This string
      will be displayed in the game's calendar UI when viewing event details. The
      string can contain any valid UTF-8 characters, but should be kept reasonable
      for display purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      std::string newDescription = "Weekly raid meeting for new players";

      event.SetDescription(newDescription);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Description Assignment
    code: "CalendarEvent* myEvent = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (myEvent)\n\
      {\n    std::string dynamicDesc = \"Event starts at \" + GetTimeString() + \"\
      \ in Dalaran\";\n    myEvent->SetDescription(dynamicDesc);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment of the description string without
    any internal processing or validation. The description is stored as-is and will
    be rendered exactly as provided in the game's UI.
