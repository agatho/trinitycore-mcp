api:
  class: SocialManager
  method: RespondToChat
  signature: bool SocialManager::RespondToChat(Player * sender, const std::string
    & message, ChatType type)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a chat response from a player and handles the appropriate social
    interaction.
  description: The RespondToChat method in the SocialManager class is responsible
    for processing incoming chat messages from players and determining how to handle
    them within the game's social system. It validates the message content, checks
    for proper chat type formatting, and ensures that the response adheres to server
    rules and player permissions. This method typically integrates with the broader
    social framework to manage player interactions, including private messages, guild
    chat, party chat, and general public channels. The method may also trigger additional
    game mechanics such as cooldowns, message filtering, or notification systems based
    on the type of chat being processed.
  parameters:
  - name: sender
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the chat message. This parameter
      is required and must not be null for the method to process the response correctly.
  - name: message
    description: The actual text content of the chat message as a std::string. This
      string should be validated for length, character restrictions, and potential
      spam or inappropriate content before processing.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of chat channel being used
      (e.g., CHAT_TYPE_SAY, CHAT_TYPE_YELL, CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER). This determines how
      the message is routed and processed within the social system.
  returns: Returns true if the chat response was successfully processed and handled
    according to game rules; returns false if there was an error during processing
    or if the message failed validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chat Response Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nstd::string msg = \"Hello everyone!\";\nbool result\
      \ = sSocialMgr->RespondToChat(player, msg, CHAT_TYPE_SAY);\nif (result) {\n\
      \    // Message processed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Whisper Response with Error Handling
    code: "Player* sender = ...;\nstd::string whisperMsg = \"Private message here\"\
      ;\nChatType type = CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER;\nbool success = sSocialMgr->RespondToChat(sender,\
      \ whisperMsg, type);\nif (!success) {\n    // Handle failed chat response\n\
      \    sender->SendNotification(\"Failed to send message.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game server when a player
    sends a chat message. Developers should ensure that all input parameters are properly
    validated before calling this method, especially the sender pointer and message
    content. The method may perform additional checks such as spam detection or rate
    limiting based on server configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the sender parameter is not null to prevent crashes. Be cautious
    when handling large messages or those with special characters that might cause
    issues in the chat system. Improper use of ChatType values could lead to incorrect
    routing of messages.
