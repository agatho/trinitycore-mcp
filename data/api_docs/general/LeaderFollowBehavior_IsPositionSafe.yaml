  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is safe for the leader to move to in the follower
    behavior system
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates whether a specified position is
    considered safe for the leader character to navigate to within the context of
    leader-follow behavior. This method typically checks for obstacles, terrain suitability,
    and other environmental factors that might prevent safe movement. It's commonly
    used in AI pathfinding and movement logic to ensure that followers do not get
    stuck or move into dangerous areas. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the safety status of the position.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or index to evaluate for safety. This parameter
      likely represents a specific coordinate or node in the navigation mesh that
      the leader might move towards.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is safe for the leader to move to,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the position
    may contain obstacles, be on impassable terrain, or otherwise pose a risk to the
    leader's movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Safety Check
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->IsPositionSafe(5)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ to position 5\n    leader->MoveToPosition(5);\n} else {\n    // Find an alternative\
      \ path\n    leaderFollowBehavior->FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safety Check in Movement Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < targetPositions.size(); ++i) {\n    if (leaderFollowBehavior->IsPositionSafe(targetPositions[i]))\
      \ {\n        leader->MoveToPosition(targetPositions[i]);\n        break;\n \
      \   }\n}\n// If no safe position found, notify player\nif (i == targetPositions.size())\
      \ {\n    ChatHandler(leader->GetPlayer())->SendSysMessage(\"No safe path available.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the navigation mesh or collision
    system to determine if a position is traversable. The implementation may cache
    previous safety evaluations for performance optimization. Developers should be
    aware that this method might be called frequently during AI pathfinding operations.
  warnings: The method signature indicates that pos is passed by const reference,
    which suggests it's likely an integer identifier rather than a complex object.
    Ensure that the position values passed are valid indices or coordinates within
    the expected range to avoid undefined behavior.
