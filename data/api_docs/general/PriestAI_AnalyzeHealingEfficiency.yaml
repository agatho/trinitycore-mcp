  signature: void PriestAI::AnalyzeHealingEfficiency()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the efficiency of healing performed by the priest AI during combat.
  description: The AnalyzeHealingEfficiency method evaluates the effectiveness and
    performance of healing actions executed by the PriestAI instance. This method
    likely assesses factors such as healing done per second, target health recovery
    rates, mana usage efficiency, and overall healing distribution across party members
    or raid members. It may be invoked periodically during combat to gather data for
    optimization or reporting purposes. The analysis could influence future decision-making
    in the AI's healing priority system.

  notes: This method is likely part of an internal AI evaluation system and may not
    be directly exposed to external scripts or plugins. It might be called automatically
    by the TrinityCore framework during combat analysis phases.
