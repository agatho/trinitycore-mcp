  signature: bool RestorationHoTTracker::HasWildGrowth(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Wild Growth HoT effect active.
  description: The HasWildGrowth method determines whether a specific player currently
    has the Wild Growth heal-over-time effect applied to them. This method is typically
    used in restoration shaman spell handling to track active HoTs and prevent stacking
    or overlapping effects. The method takes a GUID parameter representing the target
    player and returns true if the Wild Growth HoT is active on that player, false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper spell mechanics
    and ensuring that players do not receive multiple instances of the same HoT effect.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player to check for Wild
      Growth HoT status
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has an active Wild Growth HoT effect,
    false if the effect is not active or the player does not exist
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player has Wild Growth active
    code: "if (restorationHoTTracker->HasWildGrowth(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player\
      \ already has Wild Growth active, handle accordingly\n    SendSpellFailedMessage(player,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_AURA_BOUNCED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasWildGrowth in spell application logic
    code: "void ApplyWildGrowth(Spell* spell) {\n    Unit* target = spell->GetHitTarget();\n\
      \    if (!target || !target->IsPlayer()) return;\n    \n    uint64 playerGuid\
      \ = target->GetGUID();\n    if (restorationHoTTracker->HasWildGrowth(playerGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Prevent stacking - Wild Growth already active\n        spell->SendCastResult(SPELL_FAILED_AURA_BOUNCED);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Apply the new Wild Growth HoT effect\n\
      \    ApplyNewWildGrowthEffect(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains an internal data structure (such as a map or
    set) of active HoT effects keyed by GUID for efficient lookup. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads, though this depends on
    the specific TrinityCore threading model in use.
  warnings: Be aware that GUIDs may become invalid after player logout or server resets,
    so callers should validate that the target player is still active before calling
    this method. Also, ensure proper synchronization if this method is called from
    different threads.
