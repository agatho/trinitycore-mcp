  brief: Sends quest reward to player with experience points and optional chat message
    hiding
  description: This method handles the delivery of quest rewards to a player, including
    experience points and optionally hiding the chat message. It is used when a player
    completes a quest and receives rewards from a quest giver. The method ensures
    proper reward distribution and can hide the chat message based on the hideChatMessage
    parameter. This function is typically called internally by the game engine during
    quest completion processing.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that was completed. This determines what
      rewards are given to the player.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the Creature that gave the quest. This is used for determining
      the reward type and ensuring proper delivery of rewards.
  - name: xp
    description: The experience points to be awarded to the player. This value represents
      the amount of XP earned from completing the quest.
  - name: hideChatMessage
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to hide the chat message associated
      with the reward. If true, the chat message will not be displayed to the player.
  returns: null

    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = GetQuest();

      Creature* questGiver = GetQuestGiver();

      uint32 xp = 1000;

      player->SendQuestReward(quest, questGiver, xp, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest reward system and should only be
    called when a player has completed a quest. The method handles both experience
    points and other rewards like items or gold. It's important to note that this
    method does not actually process the quest completion itself, but rather sends
    the reward after the quest has been completed.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by scripts or code outside of
    the core quest system. It is intended for internal use only and may cause issues
    if used incorrectly. Also, it's important to ensure that the quest giver is valid
    before calling this method.
