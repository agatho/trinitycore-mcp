  class: InstanceCoordination

  signature: void InstanceCoordination::ManageLootPriorities(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Manages loot priority assignments for group members within an instance.
  description: The ManageLootPriorities method is responsible for handling and updating
    loot distribution priorities among group members in a World of Warcraft instance.
    This method ensures that players within a group are assigned appropriate loot
    roll priorities based on various factors such as role, gear level, or instance-specific
    rules. It typically operates during instance entry or when loot is generated,
    coordinating with the group's loot master to determine fair and balanced distribution.
    The method may also handle priority resets or updates when group composition changes.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group for which
      loot priorities are being managed. Must be a valid group pointer, typically
      obtained from the player's current instance group membership.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance entry
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterInstance(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (group)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->ManageLootPriorities(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage during loot generation
    code: "void HandleLootGeneration(Player* player, Loot* loot)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && loot)\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->ManageLootPriorities(group);\n\
      \        // Proceed with normal loot distribution\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the instance management
    system when group composition changes or during loot generation. Developers should
    not call this method directly unless implementing custom loot coordination logic.
    The method may perform internal checks to prevent redundant operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group pointer is valid and that the player
    is actually part of a group before invoking this method.
