  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::CanRetryInterrupt(const InterruptContext &
    context) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell interrupt action can be retried based on the provided
    interrupt context.
  description: The CanRetryInterrupt method evaluates if a spell interrupt action
    is eligible for retry under specific conditions defined by the InterruptContext.
    This method is typically used in spell processing logic to determine if an interrupted
    spell should attempt to reapply or restart its interruption sequence. The decision
    is based on factors such as the type of interruption, timing, and state of the
    affected unit or spell. It plays a key role in maintaining proper spell flow and
    preventing infinite loops during interrupt handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell interrupt action can be retried according to
    the context; otherwise, returns false. A return value of false typically indicates
    that the interrupt has already been processed or that retry conditions are not
    met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell interrupt handling
    code: "if (spellInterruptAction.CanRetryInterrupt(context)) {\n    // Retry the\
      \ interrupt logic\n    spellInterruptAction.ExecuteInterrupt();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Skip retry and proceed with normal flow\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell interruption system in TrinityCore.
    It's important to ensure that the InterruptContext passed to this method contains
    valid data, as invalid or stale context may lead to incorrect retry decisions.
    The method should be called before attempting any retry logic to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
  warnings: Do not call this method without a properly initialized InterruptContext,
    as it may result in undefined behavior or incorrect interrupt handling. Also,
    be cautious of recursive calls that could lead to stack overflow if retry conditions
    are not carefully managed.
