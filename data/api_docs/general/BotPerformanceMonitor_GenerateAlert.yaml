  method: GenerateAlert
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::GenerateAlert(AlertLevel level, MetricType
    type, uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t value, uint64_t threshold, const std::string
    & message)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance alert for a bot based on specified metric and threshold
    values.
  description: The GenerateAlert method is used to log or notify about performance
    issues related to a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework. It takes in
    an alert level, metric type, bot GUID, current value, threshold value, and a descriptive
    message to create a structured alert entry. This functionality is typically used
    by the BotPerformanceMonitor class to track and report on bot behavior that exceeds
    predefined performance limits or thresholds. The method does not return any value
    but may trigger logging mechanisms or in-game notifications depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The severity level of the alert, indicating how critical the performance
      issue is (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
  - name: type
    description: The type of metric being monitored (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption,
      response time).
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that triggered the alert.
  - name: value
    description: Current measured value of the metric for the bot.
  - name: threshold
    description: The threshold value that was exceeded to trigger this alert.
  - name: message
    description: Descriptive message providing additional context about the alert
      condition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Alert Generation
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.GenerateAlert(AlertLevel::WARNING, MetricType::CPU_USAGE, 123456, 950000000ULL,
      900000000ULL, "Bot CPU usage exceeded threshold");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for monitoring bot performance
    in World of Warcraft servers. It may integrate with logging systems or in-game
    reporting mechanisms to ensure administrators are notified when bots exceed acceptable
    performance metrics.
