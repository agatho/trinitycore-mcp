documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently in a battleground queue.
  description: This method determines whether the player is currently queued for a
    battleground or arena match. It returns true if the player is in a queue, false
    otherwise. The method considers both battleground and arena queues, with an optional
    parameter to ignore arena queue status. This functionality is essential for managing
    player participation in PvP activities and ensuring proper queue handling during
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in a battleground or arena queue, false otherwise.
    The method specifically checks for queued status without considering whether the
    player has entered the actual battleground or arena.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->InBattlegroundQueue()) {\n    // Player is in a queue\n   \
      \ // Do something\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not in a queue\n    // Do something\
      \ else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal queue tracking mechanisms and may be affected
    by game mechanics changes. It should be used carefully during gameplay to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: This method does not distinguish between battleground and arena queues,
    which could lead to confusion if the player is queued for both types of matches
    simultaneously.
