  class: BroadcastTextBuilder
  method: BroadcastTextBuilder
  signature: void BroadcastTextBuilder::BroadcastTextBuilder(const WorldObject * obj,
    int msgType, uint32 textId, uint8 gender, const WorldObject * target, uint32 achievementId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BroadcastTextBuilder instance with specified parameters for
    sending broadcast messages to players.
  description: The BroadcastTextBuilder constructor initializes a new instance of
    the BroadcastTextBuilder class, setting up internal state for constructing and
    broadcasting text messages to players within the game world. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server framework to send
    localized or global broadcasts to players based on various conditions such as
    gender, target object, achievement status, and message type. The builder prepares
    the necessary data structures and context required for subsequent broadcast operations.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that serves as the source of the broadcast
      message. This could be a player, NPC, or any game object initiating the broadcast.
  - name: msgType
    description: Integer value indicating the type of broadcast message being sent.
      Common values include system messages, emotes, or custom broadcasts with specific
      behaviors defined by the server.
  - name: textId
    description: Unique identifier for the text entry to be broadcasted. This ID maps
      to a localized string in the database that will be displayed to players.
  - name: gender
    description: Gender of the target player or entity receiving the broadcast. Used
      for gender-specific localization of messages (0 = male, 1 = female, 2 = neutral).
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that represents the intended recipient
      or context of the broadcast message. Can be NULL if broadcast is global.
  - name: achievementId
    description: Identifier for an achievement that may influence how the broadcast
      message is processed or displayed, particularly in relation to achievement-based
      notifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Broadcast Text Initialization
    code: 'BroadcastTextBuilder builder(player, MSG_TYPE_TEXT, 12345, GENDER_MALE,
      nullptr, 0);

      // Initializes a broadcast builder for sending text ID 12345 to male players

      // originating from ''player'' object with no specific target or achievement.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Broadcast with Target and Achievement
    code: 'BroadcastTextBuilder builder(npc, MSG_TYPE_EMOTE, 67890, GENDER_FEMALE,
      player, 1234);

      // Initializes a broadcast builder for sending emote text ID 67890 to female
      players

      // originating from ''npc'' object, targeting ''player'', and associated with
      achievement 1234.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform actual broadcasting; it only sets up the internal
    state for a broadcast operation. The actual sending of messages occurs when calling
    related methods like BroadcastToPlayers(). Ensure all parameters are valid to
    avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the game world.
  warnings: Passing invalid pointers (e.g., null obj or target) may lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Always validate that textId exists in the database before
    using it in broadcasts. Be cautious with gender values as incorrect values might
    cause localization issues.
