documentation:
  brief: Generates a cryptographically secure random password for bot accounts
  description: The GenerateSecurePassword method creates a randomly generated password
    that meets security requirements for use with bot accounts in the TrinityCore
    framework. This method ensures that each generated password is unique and sufficiently
    complex to prevent unauthorized access. The implementation likely uses a secure
    random number generator to produce passwords that comply with standard security
    practices for account management systems. This method is typically used during
    the creation or initialization of bot accounts within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the generated secure password, which is typically
    a random alphanumeric string with special characters to ensure cryptographic strength
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::string password = BotAccountMgr::GenerateSecurePassword();

      // Use the generated password for creating a new bot account

      // Example: account->SetPassword(password);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when creating new bot accounts to ensure
    security. The generated passwords are designed to be cryptographically strong
    and should not be predictable or easily guessable. Implementation details may
    involve using system-provided secure random generators.
  warnings: Do not use this method for regular player account passwords without ensuring
    it meets all security requirements. Reusing generated passwords or storing them
    insecurely could compromise bot account security.
