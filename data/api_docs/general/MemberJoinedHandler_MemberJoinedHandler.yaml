documentation:
  brief: Initializes the MemberJoinedHandler with a BotAI instance to manage guild
    member join events.
  description: The MemberJoinedHandler constructor initializes the handler with a
    provided BotAI instance. This handler is responsible for processing events when
    a new member joins a guild, allowing the AI to react accordingly such as sending
    welcome messages or updating internal state. The method sets up necessary references
    and prepares the handler for event processing within the TrinityCore framework's
    AI system. It does not perform any immediate actions but rather configures the
    handler for future use.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: MemberJoinedHandler handler(botAI);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the initialization phase of a
    bot AI component. The BotAI instance passed should be valid and properly initialized
    to avoid runtime errors.
