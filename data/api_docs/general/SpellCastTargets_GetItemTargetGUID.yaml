  method: GetItemTargetGUID
  signature: int SpellCastTargets::GetItemTargetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the item target associated with the spell cast.
  description: The GetItemTargetGUID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the item that is targeted by a spell. This method is typically used in spell
    casting logic to determine which item the spell is being cast upon or targeting.
    The returned value represents the item's GUID, which can be used to identify and
    manipulate the specific item within the game world. This method assumes that an
    item target has been set during the spell casting process; otherwise, it may return
    a default or invalid GUID value. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    this is commonly used in conjunction with item-based spells such as enchanting,
    repairing, or consumable effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the item target. If no item target
    is set, the method may return 0 or a default invalid GUID value indicating that
    no valid item target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Item Target
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// Assume targets has been populated with an\
      \ item target\nint itemGUID = targets.GetItemTargetGUID();\nif (itemGUID !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process the item target\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell targeting\
      \ item with GUID: %u\", itemGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellCastTargets class which manages all targets
    for a spell cast. The returned GUID should be validated before use to ensure it
    represents a valid item in the game world. This method does not perform any validation
    on whether the target item actually exists or is accessible.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity,
    as an invalid or zero GUID may indicate that no item target was properly set.
    Always check for null/invalid return values before attempting to use the GUID
    in operations that require a valid item reference.
