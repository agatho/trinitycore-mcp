  method: SetTargetIcon
  signature: void Group::SetTargetIcon(int symbol, int target, int changedBy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target icon for a group member.
  description: The SetTargetIcon method assigns a specific icon symbol to a target
    player within the group. This functionality is used in World of Warcraft to visually
    indicate targets such as raid markers or loot assignments. The method updates
    the group's target icon data and broadcasts the change to all group members. It
    requires proper permissions and valid symbol/target values to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: symbol
    description: 'The icon symbol to assign (0-7). Valid values correspond to standard
      raid marker icons: 0=none, 1=skull, 2=cross, 3=star, 4=circle, 5=diamond, 6=triangle,
      7=moon.'
  - name: target
    description: The GUID of the target player whose icon will be set. Must be a valid
      player GUID within the group.
  - name: changedBy
    description: The GUID of the player who initiated the icon change. Used for tracking
      and validation purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a Skull Icon on Target Player
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    ObjectGuid targetGuid\
      \ = player->GetTarget();\n    ObjectGuid changerGuid = player->GetGUID();\n\
      \    group->SetTargetIcon(1, targetGuid, changerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Assign Star Marker to Raid Member
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && player->IsInRaid())\n\
      {\n    Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(targetGuid);\n    if\
      \ (targetPlayer && targetPlayer->GetGroup() == group)\n    {\n        group->SetTargetIcon(3,\
      \ targetGuid, player->GetGUID());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only works for players within the same group. The icon symbol
    values are limited to 0-7 as defined by the game's raid marker system. Changes
    are automatically synchronized to all group members through the TrinityCore packet
    system.
  warnings: Ensure that the target player is actually part of the group before calling
    this method, otherwise it may cause undefined behavior or client-side errors.
    The changedBy parameter should always be set to the actual player performing the
    action for proper tracking.
