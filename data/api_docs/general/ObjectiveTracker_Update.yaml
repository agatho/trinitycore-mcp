  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the objective tracker state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method in the ObjectiveTracker class is responsible for
    processing and refreshing the state of tracked objectives within the game world.
    This method is typically called during the game loop to ensure that objective
    progress, timers, and visual indicators are synchronized with the current game
    time. It handles internal state management for quest objectives, achievements,
    and other tracked activities, ensuring that players receive accurate feedback
    on their progress. The method takes a time delta parameter to determine how much
    time has passed since the last update, which is essential for maintaining consistent
    timing across different system performance conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value determines how much time has elapsed and is used to advance objective
      timers and update visual states accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n\
      \    objectiveTracker.Update(diff);\n    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Session
    code: "class PlayerSession\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n\
      \        if (player)\n        {\n            player->GetObjectiveTracker().Update(diff);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    objective tracking. The diff parameter is crucial for maintaining consistent timing
    behavior across different hardware configurations. The implementation likely handles
    various objective types including quest progress, achievement completion, and
    timed events.
  warnings: Do not call this method without a valid time delta value, as incorrect
    values can cause objective timers to behave erratically. This method modifies
    internal state and should only be called from the main game thread to avoid race
    conditions.
