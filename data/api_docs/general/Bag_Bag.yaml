documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Bag object with default values and prepares it for use
    in the game world.
  description: The Bag constructor initializes a new Bag instance, setting up its
    internal state and preparing it for integration into the game world. This method
    is typically invoked when creating new bag objects programmatically or during
    object instantiation from the game's object factory system. The constructor ensures
    that all necessary member variables are properly initialized with default values,
    and that the bag is in a valid state ready to hold items. In the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture, this constructor may also register the bag with relevant subsystems
    such as the item registry or inventory management systems. It's important to note
    that this method does not automatically assign a unique identifier (GUID) or attach
    the bag to any player or container; these operations typically occur later in
    the object lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Bag instance
    code: 'Bag* newBag = new Bag();

      // The bag is now initialized and ready to be used

      // Additional setup may be required before adding items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Bag constructor in object creation context
    code: "class PlayerInventory {\npublic:\n    void AddNewBag() {\n        Bag*\
      \ bag = new Bag();\n        // Perform additional initialization\n        bag->SetOwner(player);\n\
      \        player->AddItem(bag);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Bag constructor does not perform any database operations or network communication.
    It only initializes the object's memory state. The actual creation of the bag
    in the game world (including GUID assignment and persistence) typically occurs
    through other methods such as CreateItem() or similar factory functions. Developers
    should be aware that bags created with this constructor are not automatically
    registered with the game's item system and may require additional setup before
    they can be used effectively.
  warnings: Calling the Bag constructor directly without proper initialization of
    parent classes or associated systems may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that
    any derived classes properly call their base class constructors, and that all
    necessary subsystems are initialized before attempting to use the bag in gameplay
    scenarios.
