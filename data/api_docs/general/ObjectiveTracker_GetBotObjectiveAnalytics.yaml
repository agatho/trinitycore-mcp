    botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the analytics data for a specified bot's objectives.
  description: The GetBotObjectiveAnalytics method fetches the ObjectiveAnalytics
    object associated with a given bot GUID. This method is used to access detailed
    tracking information about objectives completed or in progress by a specific bot
    within the game environment. The returned analytics typically include statistics
    such as completion times, objective counts, and performance metrics related to
    the bot's activity. It is important to note that this method assumes the bot GUID
    corresponds to an existing tracked bot; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or
    result in an invalid reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an ObjectiveAnalytics object containing detailed
    tracking data for the specified bot's objectives. The returned object should not
    be modified directly as it is a const reference.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Analytics for a Specific Bot
    code: 'uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      const ObjectiveAnalytics& analytics = objectiveTracker->GetBotObjectiveAnalytics(botGuid);

      // Use analytics to display or process bot objective data

      printf("Completed objectives: %u\n", analytics.GetCompletedCount());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectiveTracker system which manages tracking
    of player and bot activities related to objectives. Ensure that the provided botGuid
    is valid and corresponds to a tracked entity, otherwise accessing the returned
    reference may lead to undefined behavior.
