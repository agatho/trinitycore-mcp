documentation:
  brief: Returns a const iterator pointing to the end of the summon list.
  description: The end() method returns a const_iterator that points to the position
    just past the last element in the SummonList. This iterator is used to mark the
    end of the range when iterating through summons. The returned iterator should
    not be dereferenced as it does not point to a valid element. It is commonly used
    in range-based for loops or with standard algorithms to define the upper bound
    of iteration. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method allows
    safe traversal of summoned creatures or objects within a summon list without modifying
    the list contents.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const_iterator pointing to the position after the last element in the
    SummonList. This iterator can be used to determine the end of the iteration range
    but should not be dereferenced directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Iteration Example
    code: "for (const auto& summon : summonList)\n{\n    // Process each summon\n\
      }\n// Or using explicit iterators:\nauto it = summonList.begin();\nauto end\
      \ = summonList.end();\nwhile (it != end)\n{\n    // Process *it\n    ++it;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using end() with std::distance
    code: "#include <algorithm>\nsize_t count = std::distance(summonList.begin(),\
      \ summonList.end());\n// Count total summons in the list\nif (count > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform operations on non-empty summon list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned const_iterator is immutable and cannot be used to modify elements
    in the SummonList. It's important to use proper iterator comparison (it != end)
    rather than relying on size checks for loop termination. This method provides
    a consistent interface for container-like iteration patterns across different
    summon list implementations.
  warnings: Never attempt to dereference the returned const_iterator directly as it
    points past the last element. Using invalid iterators can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes in the game server.
