  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: ValidateCreature
  signature: bool SpatialGridQueryHelpers::ValidateCreature(Player * bot, int guid,
    bool requireAlive, bool requireHostile)
documentation:
  brief: Validates a creature entry in the spatial grid for a given player, checking
    its existence and optional conditions.
  description: The ValidateCreature method checks whether a specified creature GUID
    exists within the spatial grid associated with the given player. It can optionally
    verify that the creature is alive and/or hostile. This function is typically used
    by AI systems or quest scripts to ensure valid targets before performing actions
    on them. The method performs grid-based lookup and respects visibility rules,
    making it suitable for use in player-centric spatial queries. It returns true
    if all validation criteria are met, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the entity performing the
      query. Used to determine the spatial grid context and visibility rules.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the creature
      to validate within the player's spatial grid.
  - name: requireAlive
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the creature must be alive for validation
      to pass. If true, dead creatures will fail validation.
  - name: requireHostile
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the creature must be hostile toward
      the player for validation to pass. If true, non-hostile creatures will fail
      validation.
  returns: 'Returns a boolean value: true if the creature exists in the spatial grid
    and meets all specified conditions (alive, hostile), false otherwise.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation
    code: "if (SpatialGridQueryHelpers::ValidateCreature(player, 12345, false, false))\
      \ {\n    // Creature exists and is valid\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Alive Hostile Validation
    code: "if (SpatialGridQueryHelpers::ValidateCreature(player, 67890, true, true))\
      \ {\n    // Creature must be alive and hostile\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current spatial grid boundaries and visibility
    settings. Performance may degrade if called frequently without caching results.
    The function does not perform any direct interaction with the creature object
    itself, only validates its presence and state.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid before calling this method; invalid
    GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Be cautious when using requireAlive=true
    in scenarios where creatures might be temporarily invulnerable or in combat states.
