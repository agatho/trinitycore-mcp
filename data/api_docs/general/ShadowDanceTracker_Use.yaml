documentation:
  brief: Activates the Shadow Dance ability for the player, applying its effects and
    initiating the cooldown period.
  description: The Use method triggers the activation of the Shadow Dance ability
    within the ShadowDanceTracker class. This method is typically called when a player
    attempts to use their Shadow Dance ability, which grants temporary benefits such
    as increased damage or stealth. The method handles the application of buffs, updates
    internal state tracking, and initiates the cooldown timer for the ability. It
    ensures that the ability can only be used under valid conditions, such as having
    sufficient resource points or meeting prerequisite requirements. This method is
    part of the game's combat system and directly affects player performance during
    encounters.

      tracker.Use();'

  notes: This method assumes that all preconditions for using Shadow Dance have been
    validated prior to invocation. The actual effects of the ability are handled by
    other systems within the TrinityCore framework, such as aura application and stat
    modification handlers.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in unexpected
    behavior or game state inconsistencies. Ensure that resource checks and cooldown
    validations are performed before invoking Use().
