  class: EquipmentManager
  method: IsProtectedItem
  signature: bool EquipmentManager::IsProtectedItem(int * player, int * item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified item is protected from being equipped or modified
    by the player.
  description: The IsProtectedItem method checks if a given item is marked as protected
    within the EquipmentManager system. This typically prevents certain items from
    being equipped, unequipped, or modified by players under specific conditions such
    as during quests, in PvP scenarios, or when items are flagged as non-transferable.
    The method evaluates both the player and item parameters to determine protection
    status. It's commonly used in conjunction with equipment validation logic to enforce
    game rules and prevent exploits related to item manipulation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or context.
      This parameter is used to identify which player's equipment state is being evaluated.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the item's identifier or context.
      This parameter specifies which item's protection status is being checked.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is protected for the given player, otherwise
    returns false. A protected item cannot be equipped, unequipped, or modified by
    the player according to game rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (equipmentManager.IsProtectedItem(&playerId, &itemId)) {\n    // Item\
      \ is protected; prevent equipping\n    SendSystemMessage(\"This item cannot\
      \ be equipped.\");\n} else {\n    // Item can be equipped normally\n    EquipItem(playerId,\
      \ itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Validation
    code: "bool CanEquipItem(int playerId, int itemId) {\n    if (equipmentManager.IsProtectedItem(&playerId,\
      \ &itemId)) {\n        // Check if player has special permission\n        if\
      \ (!HasSpecialPermission(playerId, \"item_override\")) {\n            return\
      \ false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal item flags and player state tracking.
    The protection logic may vary depending on the item's properties, the player's
    current game state (e.g., PvP status), or quest progress. It is recommended to
    cache results where performance is critical due to potential frequent calls during
    equipment changes.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrect handling of these parameters may
    lead to crashes or unexpected protection states.
