documentation:
  brief: Sets the selected dungeons for a player's LFG group
  description: This method updates the set of dungeons that a player has selected
    for a Looking For Group (LFG) activity. It is used internally by the LFG system
    to track which dungeons a player has chosen to queue for, typically after they
    have made their dungeon selection in the LFG interface. The method takes a player's
    GUID and a set of dungeon IDs, updating the internal LFG data structure accordingly.
    This is part of the core LFG matchmaking mechanism in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose selected dungeons
      are being updated
  - name: dungeons
    description: A set containing the IDs of dungeons that the player has selected
      for LFG queuing
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Selected Dungeons for a Player
    code: "LfgDungeonSet dungeons;\ndungeons.insert(123); // Insert dungeon ID\n dungeons.insert(456);\
      \ // Insert another dungeon ID\nLFGMgr::instance()->SetSelectedDungeons(playerGuid,\
      \ dungeons);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player makes their dungeon selection
    in the LFG interface. The LFG manager uses this information to match players with
    compatible groups for dungeon finding. This method does not directly trigger queueing
    or matching; it only updates the internal state of selected dungeons.
