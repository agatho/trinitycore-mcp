documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the behavior manager, cleaning up all active behaviors and releasing
    associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all active
    behaviors managed by the BehaviorManager. It ensures that all running behavior
    instances are properly stopped, cleaned up, and their resources released. This
    method is typically called during server shutdown or when the behavior manager
    needs to be reset. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    operations. It is designed to be thread-safe and should be invoked before the
    BehaviorManager object is destroyed to prevent resource leaks or undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BehaviorManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetBehaviorManager();

      manager->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the BehaviorManager is no longer needed
    or during server shutdown. Calling Shutdown multiple times may lead to undefined
    behavior if not properly synchronized. The method internally handles cleanup of
    all active behaviors, so developers do not need to manually stop individual behaviors
    before calling this function.
