documentation:
  brief: Computes and returns the entrance location index for completed encounters
    in an instance.
  description: This method calculates the appropriate entrance location within an
    instance based on the mask of completed encounters. It is typically used to determine
    where players should be teleported or how the instance's progression state should
    be handled. The method takes a bitmask representing completed encounters and returns
    an integer indicating the relevant entrance location index. This functionality
    supports dynamic instance progression mechanics in TrinityCore, allowing for conditional
    teleportation or state management based on encounter completion status.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the computed entrance location index for completed
    encounters. A value of -1 may indicate an error or invalid state, while positive
    values correspond to valid entrance locations within the instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in encounter completion logic
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnEncounterComplete(uint32 encounterId)\n{\n   \
      \ uint32 completedMask = GetCompletedEncountersMask();\n    int entranceIndex\
      \ = ComputeEntranceLocationForCompletedEncounters(completedMask);\n    if (entranceIndex\
      \ >= 0)\n    {\n        // Teleport players to the computed entrance location\n\
      \        DoTeleportPlayersToEntrance(entranceIndex);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's instance management
    system. Developers should ensure that encounter completion masks are properly
    maintained and updated to reflect current progress state.
