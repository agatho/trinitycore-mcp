  class: Unit
  method: SetDisableGravity
  signature: bool Unit::SetDisableGravity(bool disable, bool updateAnimTier)
documentation:
  brief: Disables or enables gravity for the unit, allowing for floating or falling
    behavior control.
  description: This method controls the gravity state of a Unit, enabling or disabling
    it based on the input parameter. When gravity is disabled, the unit can float
    in place without being affected by gravitational forces, which is commonly used
    for floating movement or special effects like levitation. The method also optionally
    updates the animation tier to reflect the new gravity state. This functionality
    is essential for managing movement mechanics and special abilities that require
    floating or non-gravity states.
  parameters:
  - name: disable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to disable (true) or enable (false)
      gravity for the unit.
  - name: updateAnimTier
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to update the animation tier when
      changing gravity state. If true, the animation will reflect the new gravity
      state; if false, animation updates are skipped.
  returns: Returns true if the operation was successful and the gravity state was
    changed, otherwise returns false if the operation failed or if the unit is already
    in the desired gravity state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->SetDisableGravity(true);

      // Unit now floats without gravity

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with animation update
    code: 'Unit* unit = creature;

      unit->SetDisableGravity(false, true);

      // Unit re-enables gravity and updates animation tier

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method affects the unit's movement behavior and can be used for special
    effects like levitation or floating. It is typically used in conjunction with
    movement abilities or during specific game events where gravity needs to be temporarily
    disabled.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as disabling gravity may interfere
    with normal movement mechanics and could cause unexpected behavior if not properly
    handled. Also, ensure that the unit's animation tier is updated appropriately
    to reflect the new state.
