  brief: Handles database connection errors for a specific connection index in the
    bot database pool
  description: The HandleConnectionError method is responsible for managing and responding
    to database connection failures within the BotDatabasePool. When a database connection
    error occurs, this method is invoked with the index of the failed connection to
    perform appropriate error handling and recovery actions. The method likely attempts
    to log the error, close the problematic connection, and potentially initiate reconnection
    logic or notify other components about the connection failure. This method plays
    a critical role in maintaining the stability and reliability of database operations
    for bot-related functionality in TrinityCore.

  - title: Basic usage when connection error occurs
    code: "void SomeBotClass::OnDatabaseError(size_t failedConnectionIndex)\n{\n \
      \   BotDatabasePool::Instance().HandleConnectionError(failedConnectionIndex);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the database pool management
    system when a connection failure is detected. Developers should not call this
    method directly unless implementing custom error handling logic. The method may
    be invoked from different threads depending on how the database pool manages asynchronous
    operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid connection index could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the connection index passed is valid and corresponds
    to an actual connection in the pool before invoking this method.
