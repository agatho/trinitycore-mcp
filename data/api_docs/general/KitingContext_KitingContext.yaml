documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new KitingContext instance with default values.
  description: The KitingContext constructor initializes a new instance of the KitingContext
    class, setting up internal state variables and preparing the context for use in
    kiting-related game mechanics. This method is typically called when creating a
    new kiting behavior context for a player or NPC within the TrinityCore framework.
    The initialization process ensures that all member variables are properly configured
    with default values, making the context ready for subsequent operations such as
    pathfinding, movement optimization, or combat-related kiting calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic KitingContext Initialization
    code: 'KitingContext context;

      // The context is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating KitingContext in a Player Movement Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player)\n{\n    KitingContext kitingCtx;\n\
      \    // Use kitingCtx for movement calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked automatically when a KitingContext
    object is instantiated. Developers should be aware that the default initialization
    may not set all parameters to optimal values for specific gameplay scenarios,
    and additional configuration might be required depending on the intended use case.
