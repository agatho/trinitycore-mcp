  class: BotSpawner
  method: GetActiveBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotSpawner::GetActiveBotCount(uint32 mapId, bool useMapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of active bot instances on a specified map or across
    all maps.
  description: The GetActiveBotCount method retrieves the number of currently active
    bot instances within the game world. It can optionally filter bots by a specific
    map ID if the useMapId parameter is set to true. This functionality is primarily
    used for managing bot populations, monitoring system load, and ensuring that bot
    limits are respected across different zones or instances. The method provides
    a snapshot of active bots at the time of invocation and does not account for bots
    that may be in transition states such as spawning or despawning.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map to query for active bots. This parameter
      is only considered when useMapId is set to true.
  - name: useMapId
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to filter results by the specified
      map ID. If false, the method returns the total count of all active bots across
      all maps.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of active bot instances. Returns
    zero if no bots are currently active or if an invalid map ID is provided when
    useMapId is true.
  examples:
  - title: Get total active bots across all maps
    code: uint32 totalBots = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount(0, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Get active bots on a specific map
    code: uint32 mapBots = botSpawner->GetActiveBotCount(1234, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on internal bot tracking structures.
    It is optimized for frequent calls but should not be used in performance-critical
    sections without considering caching strategies. The returned count reflects only
    bots that are fully initialized and active in the world, excluding those in pending
    spawn or despawn states.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid map ID while useMapId is true may
    return unexpected results. Ensure that the map ID corresponds to a valid, loaded
    map before invoking this function. Additionally, since bot activity can change
    rapidly, the returned count should be treated as a momentary snapshot and not
    relied upon for real-time decisions without re-evaluation.
