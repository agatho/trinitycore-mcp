  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void NavMeshInterface::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the navigation mesh interface, releasing all associated resources
    and cleaning up internal state.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the NavMeshInterface
    instance by releasing all allocated memory, closing any active connections to
    navigation data, and ensuring that no further navigation queries can be processed.
    This method should typically be called during server shutdown or when the navigation
    system needs to be temporarily disabled. It ensures proper cleanup of internal
    structures such as tile caches, navigation meshes, and associated data structures
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability. The method is designed
    to be idempotent, meaning it can be safely called multiple times without causing
    errors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'NavMeshInterface* navMesh = new NavMeshInterface();

      // ... initialize and use navMesh ...

      navMesh->Shutdown();

      delete navMesh;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Server Shutdown Integration
    code: "void World::UpdateWorldState()\n{\n    // ... other world updates ...\n\
      \    if (sWorld->GetGameState() == STATE_SHUTTING_DOWN)\n    {\n        sNavMesh->Shutdown();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no active navigation queries are pending.
    Calling Shutdown while navigation processing is in progress may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. The method performs cleanup operations that are essential
    for proper server shutdown sequences and memory management.
  warnings: Never call Shutdown on a NavMeshInterface instance that is currently being
    accessed by other threads, as this can lead to race conditions and memory corruption.
    Ensure all navigation-related operations have completed before invoking this method.
