  method: GetPlayerBattleground
  signature: int * BattlegroundAI::GetPlayerBattleground(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the battleground identifier associated with a given player.
  description: The GetPlayerBattleground method is used to obtain the battleground
    identifier (BGID) for a specific player within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method allows AI systems and game logic to determine which battleground instance
    a particular player is currently participating in. The method takes a pointer
    to an integer representing the player's unique identifier and returns a pointer
    to an integer that contains the battleground ID. It is typically used by battleground
    AI systems to manage player assignments, track player status, and coordinate gameplay
    events across different battleground instances.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID)
      of the player whose battleground information is being requested.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer containing the battleground identifier
    (BGID) for the specified player. If the player is not currently in a battleground,
    this may return NULL or a special value indicating no active battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerGUID = 12345;\nint* bgID = battlegroundAI->GetPlayerBattleground(&playerGUID);\n\
      if (bgID != nullptr) {\n    printf(\"Player is in battleground %d\\n\", *bgID);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Player is not in a battleground\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerGUID = 12345;\nint* bgID = battlegroundAI->GetPlayerBattleground(&playerGUID);\n\
      if (bgID != nullptr && *bgID > 0) {\n    // Player is in a valid battleground\n\
      \    switch (*bgID) {\n        case 1:\n            printf(\"Player is in Alterac\
      \ Valley\\n\");\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            printf(\"\
      Player is in Warsong Gulch\\n\");\n            break;\n        default:\n  \
      \          printf(\"Player is in unknown battleground %d\\n\", *bgID);\n   \
      \ }\n} else {\n    // Player not in battleground or error occurred\n    printf(\"\
      Player not assigned to any battleground\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and assumes that player
    data is properly initialized within the battleground framework. The returned pointer
    should be treated as read-only and should not be modified directly. Performance
    considerations may apply when called frequently during gameplay loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual player in the system. Passing invalid or uninitialized pointers may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. The returned pointer must be checked
    for NULL before dereferencing.
