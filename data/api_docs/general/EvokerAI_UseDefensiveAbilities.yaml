  method: UseDefensiveAbilities
  signature: void EvokerAI::UseDefensiveAbilities()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and applies appropriate defensive abilities for the evoker unit
    based on current combat state and health conditions.
  description: The UseDefensiveAbilities method is responsible for determining when
    and which defensive spells or abilities should be cast by an EvokerAI-controlled
    unit. This method typically checks the evoker's current health percentage, threat
    level, and available mana to decide whether to use defensive cooldowns such as
    'Emerald Blossom', 'Dream Breath', or other class-specific defensive mechanics.
    It integrates with the core AI decision-making loop to ensure optimal resource
    management during combat. The method does not directly cast spells but rather
    evaluates conditions and triggers appropriate actions through the AI framework.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    UseDefensiveAbilities();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the UpdateAI loop of the EvokerAI
    class. It relies on internal state tracking for health thresholds and cooldowns,
    so it should only be invoked when the AI unit has a valid target and is in combat
    mode. The actual spell casting behavior depends on the underlying TrinityCore
    AI system and spell availability.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or without an active victim,
    as it may lead to invalid spell targeting or incorrect AI behavior. Ensure that
    the evoker unit has sufficient mana before invoking defensive abilities to avoid
    unnecessary resource waste.
