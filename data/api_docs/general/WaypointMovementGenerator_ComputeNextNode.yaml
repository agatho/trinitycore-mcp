  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: ComputeNextNode
  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::ComputeNextNode()
documentation:
  brief: Computes and advances to the next waypoint in the movement sequence for a
    creature.
  description: The ComputeNextNode method is responsible for determining the next
    waypoint in a creature's predefined path. It evaluates the current state of the
    movement generator, updates internal tracking variables, and prepares the creature
    for movement toward the subsequent waypoint. This method is typically invoked
    during the creature's update cycle to ensure smooth progression along its assigned
    waypoints. The method returns true if a valid next node was found and processed,
    or false if the end of the path has been reached or an error occurred during processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the next waypoint was successfully computed and the creature
    is set to move toward it; returns false if there are no more waypoints to process
    or if the computation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement update
    code: "void Creature::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_movementGenerator\
      \ && m_movementGenerator->GetMovementGeneratorType() == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_WAYPOINT)\n\
      \    {\n        WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = static_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(m_movementGenerator);\n\
      \        if (!wpGen->ComputeNextNode())\n        {\n            // Path completed\
      \ or error occurred\n            m_movementGenerator->Reset();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the waypoint data is already loaded and valid. It
    does not perform any validation on waypoint coordinates or path integrity. The
    method relies on internal state tracking to determine which node should be processed
    next, so it must be called consistently during the creature's update loop.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the waypoint movement
    generator can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the creature has a valid
    path and that all waypoints are properly loaded before invoking this method.
