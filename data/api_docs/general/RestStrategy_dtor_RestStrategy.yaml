  class: RestStrategy
  method: ~RestStrategy
  signature: void RestStrategy::~RestStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a RestStrategy instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The ~RestStrategy destructor is called automatically when a RestStrategy
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal resources, memory, or state managed by the RestStrategy
    class. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor may handle cleanup
    of AI-related data structures or references that were allocated during the lifetime
    of the rest strategy. The destruction process typically involves releasing memory,
    invalidating pointers, and ensuring no dangling references remain in the AI subsystem.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    RestStrategy strategy;\n    // ... use strategy\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when strategy goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'RestStrategy* strategy = new RestStrategy();

      // ... use strategy ...

      delete strategy; // Triggers ~RestStrategy destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects are
    destroyed. Developers should not manually call destructors unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore's AI framework, rest strategies
    are typically managed through smart pointers or container classes, so explicit
    destruction is rarely needed.
  warnings: Do not explicitly invoke destructors in normal code flow as this can lead
    to undefined behavior. When using dynamic allocation, ensure proper pairing of
    new/delete or use smart pointers for automatic memory management.
