  signature: bool GroupInvitationHandler::AcceptInvitation(int inviterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts a group invitation from the specified player GUID
  description: The AcceptInvitation method processes a group invitation received from
    another player in World of Warcraft. It attempts to add the calling player to
    the group led by the inviter, provided that the invitation is valid and the player
    meets all requirements for joining the group. This method typically handles the
    logic for accepting invites, including checking if the player is already in a
    group, verifying the invitation state, and performing necessary group management
    operations. The method returns true upon successful acceptance of the invitation,
    or false if the invitation could not be accepted due to game rules or invalid
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: inviterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the group invitation.
      This is used to identify which invitation to accept and to validate that the
      inviter is still valid.
  returns: Returns true if the invitation was successfully accepted and the player
    was added to the group, false otherwise. A return value of false may occur if
    the player is already in a group, the invitation has expired, or the inviter is
    no longer valid.
  examples:
  - title: Accepting a Group Invitation
    code: "GroupInvitationHandler handler;\nuint32 inviterGuid = 123456;\nbool success\
      \ = handler.AcceptInvitation(inviterGuid);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Player successfully\
      \ joined the group\n    printf(\"Successfully accepted group invitation from\
      \ player %u\\n\", inviterGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to accept the invitation\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to accept group invitation from player %u\\n\", inviterGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game client or server when
    a player chooses to accept a group invitation. It assumes that an invitation has
    already been sent and is pending for the current player. The implementation may
    perform checks such as ensuring the inviter is still online, hasn't left their
    current group, and that the player isn't already in another group.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a valid invitation exists for the
    player. Calling it without an active invitation may result in unexpected behavior
    or errors. Additionally, if the inviter GUID refers to a player who is no longer
    in a valid state (e.g., disconnected), the acceptance may fail even if the method
    is otherwise correctly invoked.
