  class: BotSpawner
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const SpawnConfig & BotSpawner::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spawn configuration associated with the bot spawner instance.
  description: The GetConfig method provides access to the SpawnConfig object that
    defines how bots are spawned within the TrinityCore environment. This configuration
    typically includes parameters such as spawn rates, bot types, geographical constraints,
    and other behavioral settings. The returned reference is constant, ensuring that
    external code cannot modify the internal configuration directly. This method is
    essential for retrieving current spawning rules and settings at runtime without
    requiring additional lookups or synchronization mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the SpawnConfig object that governs bot spawning
    behavior for this spawner instance. The reference remains valid as long as the
    BotSpawner instance exists.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Spawn Configuration
    code: 'BotSpawner* spawner = ...;

      const SpawnConfig& config = spawner->GetConfig();

      uint32 spawnRate = config.spawnRate;

      bool isEnabled = config.enabled;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reading Configuration Values for Logic
    code: "void CheckSpawnerStatus(BotSpawner* spawner) {\n    const SpawnConfig&\
      \ config = spawner->GetConfig();\n    if (config.enabled && config.spawnRate\
      \ > 0) {\n        // Proceed with spawning logic\n        LOG_INFO(\"spawner\"\
      , \"Bot spawner is active with rate {}\", config.spawnRate);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference to avoid accidental modification
    of the configuration. The SpawnConfig object should not be modified through this
    reference, as it may lead to inconsistent behavior in bot spawning logic. Ensure
    that any changes to spawn settings are made via dedicated setter methods or configuration
    management systems.
