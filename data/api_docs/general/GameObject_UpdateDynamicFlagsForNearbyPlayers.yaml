documentation:
  brief: Updates dynamic flags for all nearby players to reflect current GameObject
    state
  description: This method synchronizes the dynamic flags of a GameObject with all
    players within its visibility range. It ensures that nearby players receive updated
    information about the object's interactive state, such as whether it is usable,
    locked, or has changed in some way that affects player interaction. The method
    typically triggers a packet update to clients, notifying them of any changes to
    the GameObject's dynamic properties. This is essential for maintaining accurate
    client-side representation of game objects and enabling proper interaction mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->UpdateDynamicFlagsForNearbyPlayers();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever the GameObject's dynamic flags change
    to ensure client synchronization. It internally iterates through all players in
    the object's grid and sends update packets only if necessary, minimizing network
    overhead. The method is typically invoked automatically by the core when relevant
    state changes occur.
