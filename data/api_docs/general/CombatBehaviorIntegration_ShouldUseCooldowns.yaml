  method: ShouldUseCooldowns
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::ShouldUseCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether cooldowns should be used in combat behavior.
  description: The ShouldUseCooldowns method evaluates the current combat state and
    player conditions to decide if cooldown abilities should be activated. This method
    is typically used within AI decision-making logic to determine optimal timing
    for using cooldowns such as defensive abilities, offensive spells, or utility
    skills. It considers factors like target threat level, health status, mana availability,
    and cooldown timers of relevant abilities. The method returns true when cooldown
    usage is recommended based on combat behavior rules, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if cooldowns should be used in the current combat scenario,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the AI system has determined
    it is optimal to activate cooldown abilities at this moment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (combatBehavior->ShouldUseCooldowns()) {\n    // Activate cooldown ability\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, COOLDOWN_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Logic
    code: "class CombatAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateCombat() {\n        if (combatBehavior->ShouldUseCooldowns())\
      \ {\n            // Check for available cooldowns\n            if (HasAvailableCooldown())\
      \ {\n                UseCooldown();\n                return true;\n        \
      \    }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatBehaviorIntegration class which handles
    AI-based combat decision making in TrinityCore. The implementation likely involves
    checking various combat state variables and player attributes to make a decision.
    This method may be called frequently during combat, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account when implementing custom logic.
  warnings: This method's behavior might change based on the current combat situation,
    so relying solely on its return value without considering other factors could
    lead to suboptimal AI decisions. Ensure proper integration with other combat state
    checks for robust behavior.
