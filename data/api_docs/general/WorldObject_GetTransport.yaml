  class: WorldObject
  method: GetTransport
  signature: TransportBase * WorldObject::GetTransport() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the transport object associated with this WorldObject, if any.
  description: The GetTransport method returns a pointer to the TransportBase object
    that the WorldObject is currently mounted on or associated with. This is commonly
    used for objects that are part of a moving transport such as boats, zeppelins,
    or other vehicles in the game world. If the object is not currently on any transport,
    the method will return nullptr. The returned pointer is valid only while the transport
    object remains in the world and is not destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the TransportBase object if the WorldObject is currently on
    a transport; otherwise, returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Object is on Transport
    code: "TransportBase* transport = player->GetTransport();\nif (transport)\n{\n\
      \    // Player is on a transport\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is on transport:\
      \ %s\", transport->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not on\
      \ any transport\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is not on any transport.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Access Transport Data
    code: "WorldObject* object = unit->GetTransport();\nif (object)\n{\n    // Get\
      \ the transport's position\n    Position transportPos = object->GetPosition();\n\
      \    // Use transport data for calculations or movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in movement and positioning logic for objects
    that can be mounted on transports. The returned TransportBase pointer should not
    be stored long-term as the transport may be destroyed or removed from the world,
    which would invalidate the pointer.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned pointer will remain valid beyond the current
    game tick. Always check for nullptr before using the returned value to avoid null
    pointer dereferences.
