  signature: void Player::ToggleMetaGemsActive(uint8 exceptslot, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Toggle meta gem activation status for the player.
  description: This method toggles the active state of meta gems on a player's equipment,
    allowing control over whether meta gems are applied or removed from specific slots.
    It is primarily used during character creation or when managing gem configurations.
    The method operates on a single slot at a time, with 'exceptslot' parameter determining
    which slot to modify, and 'apply' parameter indicating whether to apply or remove
    the meta gem.
  parameters:
  - name: exceptslot
    description: The slot index (0-18) to modify, where 0 represents main hand weapon,
      1 represents off-hand weapon, and so on. The slot number determines which specific
      gem slot is affected by the operation.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      meta gems from the specified slot. When true, meta gems are applied; when false,
      they are removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->ToggleMetaGemsActive(0, true);

      // Applies meta gems to main hand weapon slot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->ToggleMetaGemsActive(18, false);

      // Removes meta gems from the last slot (trinket slot)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's inventory system and gem management
    logic. It may be used during character creation or when adjusting gem configurations
    for optimal performance. The method is designed to work on a per-slot basis rather
    than globally across all slots.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player has access to meta gems,
    as attempting to apply meta gems without proper gem availability may cause issues.
    Also, ensure that the slot index is valid and within range before calling this
    method.
