  signature: bool Player::TeleportToBGEntryPoint()
documentation:
  brief: Teleports the player to the nearest battleground entry point.
  description: This method performs a teleportation to the nearest battleground entry
    point for the player's current faction. It is used primarily in battleground-related
    gameplay mechanics, allowing players to quickly move to the appropriate location
    for entering battlegrounds or arena matches. The method returns true if the teleportation
    was successful and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper game flow during battleground matchmaking and entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation was successful, false otherwise. A return
    value of false may indicate that no valid entry point exists or that the player
    is already in a battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->TeleportToBGEntryPoint()) {\n    // Player successfully teleported\
      \ to battleground entry point\n    // Continue with battleground setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely uses internal player state tracking
    to determine the appropriate entry point based on faction, level, and current
    zone. It may also check for existing battleground instances or queued status before
    performing the teleportation.'
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player is not already in a battleground
    instance. Calling it while in a battleground can cause unexpected behavior or
    errors. Also, this method may fail if the player's faction has no valid battleground
    entry point available.
