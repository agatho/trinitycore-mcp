  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CheckReputation
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckReputation(::Player * bot, uint32 factionId,
    int minRank) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has sufficient reputation with a specified faction to
    meet the minimum rank requirement.
  description: The CheckReputation method evaluates whether a given player possesses
    at least the specified minimum reputation rank with a particular faction. This
    function is commonly used in interaction validation logic, such as determining
    if a player can engage in certain quests, vendor interactions, or NPC dialogues
    that require specific faction standings. The method retrieves the player's current
    reputation value for the provided faction ID and compares it against the required
    minimum rank. It returns true if the player's reputation meets or exceeds the
    threshold, otherwise false. This check is essential for maintaining game balance
    and ensuring appropriate access to faction-specific content.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose reputation will be checked. Must
      not be null.
  - name: factionId
    description: Unique identifier of the faction to check reputation against. This
      corresponds to entries in the Faction.dbc file.
  - name: minRank
    description: 'Minimum required reputation rank (0-7). Values correspond to: 0=Hated,
      1=Hostile, 2=Unfriendly, 3=Neutral, 4=Friendly, 5=Honored, 6=Revered, 7=Exalted.'
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the player's reputation with the specified
    faction meets or exceeds the minimum rank. Returns true if the check passes, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reputation Check
    code: "if (validator.CheckReputation(player, 72, 4)) {\n    // Player has at least\
      \ Friendly reputation with faction ID 72\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You are welcomed by the faction.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Reputation Validation
    code: "uint32 requiredFaction = 930; // Typically Orgrimmar faction\nint minReputationRank\
      \ = 5; // Honored\nif (validator.CheckReputation(player, requiredFaction, minReputationRank))\
      \ {\n    // Allow access to special vendor items\n    player->GetSession()->SendListInventory(player->GetGUID());\n\
      } else {\n    // Deny access and send message\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You must be at least Honored with the faction to purchase this item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method relies on the player''s current reputation data stored in their
    database records. The faction ID must correspond to a valid entry in the game''s
    faction database. Reputation ranks are defined as: 0=Hated, 1=Hostile, 2=Unfriendly,
    3=Neutral, 4=Friendly, 5=Honored, 6=Revered, 7=Exalted. The method does not modify
    any player state or reputation values; it only performs a read-only check.'
  warnings: Ensure that the faction ID passed to this method is valid and exists in
    the game's database, as invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    results. Be cautious when using high rank values (6-7) for content that should
    be accessible to most players, as Exalted status is typically difficult to achieve.
