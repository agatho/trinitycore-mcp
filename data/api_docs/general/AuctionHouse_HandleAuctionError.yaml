  class: AuctionHouse
  method: HandleAuctionError
  signature: void AuctionHouse::HandleAuctionError(uint32 sessionId, const std::string
    & error)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an auction error message to the specified session.
  description: The HandleAuctionError method is responsible for delivering error notifications
    to players' clients when issues occur within the auction house system. It takes
    a session identifier and an error message string, then formats and sends this
    information back to the client through the appropriate network communication channel.
    This method ensures that players receive meaningful feedback about failed auction
    operations such as invalid item selections, insufficient funds, or permission
    denied scenarios. The method operates within the TrinityCore's auction house subsystem
    and is typically invoked by other auction-related functions when validation or
    processing errors are detected.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: The unique identifier of the client session that should receive the
      error message. This corresponds to the player's active connection within the
      server's session management system.
  - name: error
    description: A string containing the human-readable error message to be sent to
      the client. This message should clearly describe what went wrong during the
      auction operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: "void AuctionHouse::SomeAuctionFunction(uint32 sessionId)\n{\n    // Simulate\
      \ an error condition\n    if (someErrorCondition)\n    {\n        HandleAuctionError(sessionId,\
      \ \"You do not have enough gold to place this bid.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Error Handling with Dynamic Messages
    code: "void AuctionHouse::ProcessBid(uint32 sessionId, uint32 auctionId, uint32\
      \ bidAmount)\n{\n    if (bidAmount < GetMinimumBid(auctionId))\n    {\n    \
      \    std::string errorMsg = \"Bid amount must be at least \" + std::to_string(GetMinimumBid(auctionId))\
      \ + \" gold.\";\n        HandleAuctionError(sessionId, errorMsg);\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // Continue with bid processing...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the auction house communication layer and relies on
    the session management system to route messages correctly. It should only be called
    when an error condition has been validated and confirmed. The error message string
    must be properly formatted and localized for the player's language settings if
    localization is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the sessionId parameter corresponds to an active, valid session
    before calling this method, otherwise the error message may not reach the intended
    player. Avoid sending sensitive internal error details to clients as this could
    expose server vulnerabilities or provide information useful for exploits.
