  signature: int Garrison::GetPlots()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available plots in the garrison
  description: The GetPlots method retrieves the total count of plots currently available
    in the player's garrison. This value represents the maximum number of buildings
    that can be constructed within the garrison. The method is typically used to determine
    how many additional structures can be placed before reaching the garrison's capacity
    limit. In World of Warcraft's Garrison system, plots are essential for expanding
    and upgrading the player's base, with each plot allowing for one building construction.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of available plots in the
    garrison. This number typically ranges from 1 to 5 or higher depending on the
    garrison level and any applicable upgrades.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();

      int plotCount = garrison->GetPlots();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Available plots: %d", plotCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Plot Availability Before Construction
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nint availablePlots = garrison->GetPlots();\n\
      if (availablePlots > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with building construction\n    TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Constructing new building, %d plots remaining\", availablePlots);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"No plots available for new buildings\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the garrison system implementation and relies on internal
    garrison state tracking. The returned value may change dynamically as the player
    upgrades their garrison or completes certain quests that increase plot capacity.
