  signature: int DruidAI::GetComboPoints() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current number of combo points possessed by the Druid AI.
  description: The GetComboPoints method retrieves the number of combo points currently
    available to the Druid AI instance. In World of Warcraft's combat system, combo
    points are a resource used by certain abilities, particularly those of rogue and
    druid classes. For druids, combo points are typically generated through specific
    melee attacks or abilities such as Shred or Mangle. This method allows access
    to the internal combo point counter maintained by the AI, which is essential for
    decision-making in ability selection and execution logic. The returned value represents
    a numeric count of combo points, usually ranging from 0 to 5, though it may vary
    depending on game mechanics and class-specific abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current number of combo points available to
    the Druid AI. Returns 0 if no combo points are currently accumulated, and typically
    returns values between 0 and 5 for standard druid gameplay mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (druidAI->GetComboPoints() >= 3)\n{\n    // Execute an ability that\
      \ requires at least 3 combo points\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SpellId::MANGLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking combo points before attack
    code: "int comboPoints = druidAI->GetComboPoints();\nif (comboPoints > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Perform a combo point-consuming ability\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SpellId::SHRED);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Use a basic attack or generate combo points\n    druidAI->AttackTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the AI's decision-making loop to determine
    which abilities can be cast based on available combo points. The Druid AI implementation
    may update combo point counts through various internal mechanisms such as successful
    melee hits or specific ability usage, and this method provides a read-only view
    of that state.
  warnings: Ensure that the DruidAI instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing combo points on an uninitialized or invalid AI instance
    could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, note that combo point values may
    change between calls to this method if other game systems are modifying them.
