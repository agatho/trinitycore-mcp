  class: ObjectMgr
  method: ChooseDisplayId
  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::ChooseDisplayId(const int * cinfo, const int *
    data)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a valid display ID for an object based on provided creature info
    and data.
  description: The ChooseDisplayId method in ObjectMgr is responsible for determining
    an appropriate display ID for a game object, typically a creature, based on the
    input creature information and associated data. It evaluates the provided parameters
    to ensure that the selected display ID corresponds to a valid model within the
    game's asset database. This method plays a crucial role in ensuring that creatures
    appear correctly with their intended visual representations in the game world.
    The function likely performs checks against available models, handles fallbacks
    for missing or invalid IDs, and ensures compatibility with the object's type and
    other properties.
  parameters:
  - name: cinfo
    description: Pointer to creature info structure containing base creature data
      including possible display IDs and model information.
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to additional data structure that may contain override values
      or context-specific information affecting the display ID selection.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the chosen display ID. If
    no valid display ID can be selected, it may return nullptr or a default invalid
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for selecting a creature's display ID
    code: "CreatureInfo* cinfo = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\nCreatureData*\
      \ data = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureData(67890);\nconst int* displayId = sObjectMgr->ChooseDisplayId(cinfo,\
      \ data);\nif (displayId != nullptr) {\n    // Use *displayId for creature model\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during creature creation or when updating
    a creature's visual state. It may involve database lookups or internal caching
    to determine valid display IDs. The method assumes that the input pointers are
    valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both cinfo and data parameters are not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers can lead to crashes. Additionally,
    the returned pointer should be checked for validity before use.
