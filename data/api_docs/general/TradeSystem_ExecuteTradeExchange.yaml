  class: TradeSystem
  method: ExecuteTradeExchange
  signature: void TradeSystem::ExecuteTradeExchange(TradeSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the trade exchange process for a given trade session, finalizing
    item transfers between players.
  description: The ExecuteTradeExchange method processes and completes a trade transaction
    within the TradeSystem. It validates that both parties have agreed to the trade,
    ensures all items are properly transferred from one player's inventory to another,
    and handles any necessary updates to the trade session state. This method is typically
    invoked after both players have accepted the trade proposal and confirmed their
    item selections. The method performs checks to ensure no invalid items are being
    traded, such as those that are soulbound or otherwise restricted, and manages
    the removal and addition of items in the respective inventories.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Execution
    code: 'TradeSession session;

      // Assume session is properly initialized with valid trade data

      TradeSystem::ExecuteTradeExchange(session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the trade session has already been validated and
    both parties have confirmed their trade agreement. It does not perform any validation
    of item legality or inventory space checks beyond what is required for the trade
    itself.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring proper trade state validation may
    result in inconsistent inventory states or items being lost. Ensure that all preconditions
    for a valid trade are met before invoking this function.
