documentation:
  brief: Destroys the resource monitor instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotResourceMonitor interface is responsible
    for cleaning up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    releasing memory, closing file handles, or unregistering from system callbacks
    that may have been set up during initialization. As a virtual destructor, it ensures
    proper cleanup of derived class instances when deleted through a base class pointer.
    The method should be called automatically by the runtime when the object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted, and it's crucial for preventing memory
    leaks in bot resource monitoring systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of resource monitor
    code: 'IBotResourceMonitor* monitor = new BotResourceMonitor();

      // ... use the monitor ...

      delete monitor; // Triggers ~IBotResourceMonitor()'
    language: cpp
  notes: Since this is a virtual destructor, it's important that all derived classes
    also properly implement their own destructors to ensure complete cleanup. The
    destructor should not throw exceptions as it's called during stack unwinding.
