documentation:
  brief: Processes a quest giver status query from the client to determine available
    quest interactions.
  description: The HandleQuestgiverStatusQueryOpcode method handles incoming quest
    giver status queries from players in World of Warcraft. When a player interacts
    with an NPC or object that can provide quests, this method is invoked to determine
    what quest status the player has with that quest giver. It evaluates the player's
    current quest progress and sends back appropriate quest status information to
    the client, enabling the UI to display correct quest availability, objectives,
    and rewards. The method typically triggers when a player opens a quest window
    or examines an NPC's quest interaction options.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQuestgiverStatusQueryOpcode(WorldPackets::Quest::QuestGiverStatusQuery&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the quest giver status query\n    // Determine\
      \ available quests for the player\n    // Send appropriate response back to\
      \ client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core quest system and directly affects player
    interaction with NPCs. It should be called only when a valid quest giver interaction
    occurs, and typically follows a packet validation step. The method does not directly
    modify game state but rather prepares responses for the client's quest UI.
