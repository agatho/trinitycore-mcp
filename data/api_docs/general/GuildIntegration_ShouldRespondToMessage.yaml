  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ShouldRespondToMessage
  signature: bool GuildIntegration::ShouldRespondToMessage(int * player, const GuildChatMessage
    & message)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the guild integration should respond to a given guild
    chat message.
  description: The ShouldRespondToMessage method evaluates if the guild integration
    component should process and react to a specific guild chat message. This method
    is typically used during guild communication handling to filter out messages that
    do not require special processing or responses from the integration system. It
    checks various conditions such as message type, sender permissions, and integration
    settings to decide whether an action should be taken. The method ensures that
    only relevant guild communications trigger integration behaviors, optimizing performance
    and preventing unnecessary processing.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player identifier (GUID) who sent the message. This
      parameter identifies the sender of the guild chat message.
  - name: message
    description: Reference to the GuildChatMessage object containing details about
      the received message, including content, type, and metadata.
  returns: Returns true if the guild integration should respond to the message; otherwise
    returns false. A return value of true indicates that further processing or action
    is required by the integration system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in guild chat handler
    code: "if (guildIntegration->ShouldRespondToMessage(&playerGuid, guildMessage))\
      \ {\n    // Process the message with guild integration\n    guildIntegration->HandleGuildMessage(playerGuid,\
      \ guildMessage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional response based on message type
    code: "bool shouldRespond = guildIntegration->ShouldRespondToMessage(&playerGuid,\
      \ guildMessage);\nif (shouldRespond && guildMessage.GetType() == GUILD_CHAT_OFFICER)\
      \ {\n    // Only officer messages trigger special integration responses\n  \
      \  guildIntegration->SendOfficerResponse(playerGuid, guildMessage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild integration system and should be called
    before performing any specialized handling of guild chat messages. The implementation
    may check for integration enablement flags, message content filters, or sender
    role permissions. Consider performance implications when this method is called
    frequently during active guild chat events.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before passing it
    to this method. Incorrect handling of invalid pointers can lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Also, be aware that returning true does not guarantee successful
    processing; additional validation may be required in the calling code.
