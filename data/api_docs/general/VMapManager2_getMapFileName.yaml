  class: VMapManager2
  method: getMapFileName
  signature: std::string VMapManager2::getMapFileName(unsigned int mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the file name associated with a specific map ID for VMap (Virtual
    Map) data processing.
  description: The getMapFileName method is used to obtain the corresponding VMap
    file name for a given map identifier. This functionality is essential for loading
    and managing virtual terrain data in TrinityCore's collision detection system.
    The method maps internal map IDs to their respective .vmap files that contain
    heightmap and object data necessary for determining walkable areas and obstacle
    detection. It serves as a lookup mechanism within the VMapManager2 class to retrieve
    file paths required for dynamic map loading during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the file name associated with the specified
    map ID. If no mapping exists for the given mapId, it typically returns an empty
    string or a default placeholder filename.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VMapManager2* vmapMgr = VMapManager2::instance();

      std::string fileName = vmapMgr->getMapFileName(0);

      // Returns the file name for map ID 0 (e.g., ''000.vmap'')'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's VMap system which handles virtual terrain
    data for collision detection. The implementation likely uses internal mapping
    tables or directory traversal to find matching .vmap files. Performance-wise,
    this lookup should be fast as it typically involves hash table or map-based lookups.
