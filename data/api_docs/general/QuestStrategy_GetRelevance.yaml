  class: QuestStrategy
  method: GetRelevance
  signature: float QuestStrategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of a quest for the bot AI.
  description: The GetRelevance method computes a floating-point value representing
    how relevant or important a specific quest is to the bot's current AI strategy.
    This score influences decision-making processes such as quest selection, prioritization,
    and execution order within the TrinityCore bot AI framework. The relevance is
    typically determined based on factors like the bot's level, available quest rewards,
    quest requirements, and current quest state. The method takes a BotAI pointer
    as input to access contextual information about the bot's state and capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of the quest. Higher values
    indicate higher relevance or priority for the bot to pursue this quest. The exact
    range and interpretation may vary based on implementation details but generally
    falls within a normalized scale (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float relevance = questStrategy->GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.7f)\
      \ {\n    // Prioritize this quest\n    ai->GetBot()->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ = QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI decision cycles to evaluate the
    priority of available quests. It may cache computed values or use heuristics based
    on bot level, inventory state, and quest dependencies. Performance is critical
    as this method may be invoked frequently during AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    otherwise behavior is undefined. The relevance score should not be used in isolation
    for quest selection without considering other factors like quest availability
    or player objectives.
