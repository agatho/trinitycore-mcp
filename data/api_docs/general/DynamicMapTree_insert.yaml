  method: insert
  signature: void DynamicMapTree::insert(const GameObjectModel & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Inserts a GameObjectModel into the dynamic map tree for collision detection
    and spatial queries.
  description: The insert method adds a GameObjectModel instance to the DynamicMapTree
    data structure, which is used for efficient spatial partitioning and collision
    detection in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine. This allows the game to quickly
    determine which game objects are near each other or intersect with each other.
    The method integrates the provided model into the tree structure, updating internal
    node relationships and bounding volume hierarchies. It is typically called when
    game objects are added to the world or when their positions change significantly
    enough to require reinsertion. This operation modifies the internal state of the
    DynamicMapTree and should be performed with care to avoid performance degradation
    from frequent insertions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A const reference to a GameObjectModel object that represents a game
      object's collision geometry in the world. This model contains spatial data including
      bounding volumes, transformation matrices, and collision shape information used
      by the dynamic map tree for spatial queries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObjectModel Insertion
    code: 'GameObjectModel model;

      // ... initialize model with geometry data ...

      DynamicMapTree tree;

      tree.insert(model);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Inserting Multiple Models in Loop
    code: "std::vector<GameObjectModel> models;\n// ... populate models vector ...\n\
      DynamicMapTree tree;\nfor (const auto& model : models)\n{\n    tree.insert(model);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The DynamicMapTree uses a hierarchical bounding volume structure to optimize
    spatial queries. Insertion operations may trigger internal rebalancing of the
    tree structure for performance optimization. This method should not be called
    during active collision detection operations as it might invalidate iterators
    or cause race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling insert with an invalid or uninitialized GameObjectModel can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all models passed to this method
    have valid bounding volumes and transformation data before insertion. Frequent
    insertions of many objects without proper batching can significantly impact performance.
