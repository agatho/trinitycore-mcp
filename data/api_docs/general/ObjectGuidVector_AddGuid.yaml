documentation:
  brief: Adds a GUID to the ObjectGuidVector collection
  description: The AddGuid method inserts a new GUID value into the ObjectGuidVector
    container. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore server
    development when managing collections of object identifiers, such as player GUIDs,
    creature GUIDs, or game object GUIDs. The method performs no validation on the
    input GUID and simply appends it to the internal vector structure. This operation
    modifies the internal state of the ObjectGuidVector instance and increases its
    size by one element.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The integer representation of a GUID to be added to the vector. In
      TrinityCore, GUIDs are typically unique identifiers assigned to game objects,
      players, creatures, and other entities within the game world. The value should
      represent a valid object identifier from the server's perspective.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddGuid
    code: 'ObjectGuidVector guidVector;

      uint32 playerGUID = 123456;

      guidVector.AddGuid(playerGUID);

      // The vector now contains one GUID: 123456'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple GUIDs to a vector
    code: 'ObjectGuidVector guidVector;

      uint32 creatureGUID1 = 789012;

      uint32 creatureGUID2 = 345678;

      guidVector.AddGuid(creatureGUID1);

      guidVector.AddGuid(creatureGUID2);

      // The vector now contains two GUIDs: 789012 and 345678'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a simple push_back operation on an underlying
    std::vector. It does not perform any duplicate checking or sorting of GUIDs. The
    ObjectGuidVector class may be used in various server subsystems where collections
    of object identifiers need to be managed, such as in player tracking, object pooling,
    or event handling systems.
  warnings: Be cautious when adding large numbers of GUIDs without proper memory management,
    as this could lead to performance issues or memory exhaustion. Ensure that the
    GUID values being added are valid and represent actual objects within the game
    world to prevent undefined behavior or server instability.
