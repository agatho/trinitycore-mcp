  method: EnablePathSmoothing
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::EnablePathSmoothing(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables path smoothing for the pathfinding adapter.
  description: The EnablePathSmoothing method controls whether path smoothing is applied
    to calculated paths within the PathfindingAdapter. When enabled, the adapter will
    attempt to optimize and smooth the generated path by removing unnecessary waypoints
    and creating more natural movement trajectories. This feature improves the visual
    quality of NPC movement and reduces abrupt turns or jerky motions. The setting
    affects all subsequent path calculations performed by this adapter instance.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      path smoothing functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Path Smoothing
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.EnablePathSmoothing(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Path Smoothing
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.EnablePathSmoothing(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately affect already calculated paths; it only
    changes the behavior for future path calculations. The smoothing algorithm may
    introduce slight performance overhead during path generation, particularly for
    complex environments with many obstacles.
