  class: GameObject
  method: SetLootState
  signature: void GameObject::SetLootState(LootState s, Unit * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot state of a game object for a specific unit.
  description: The SetLootState method controls the loot state of a GameObject, determining
    whether it should be in a lootable state or not. This method is typically used
    during the process of looting, where the GameObject's state changes based on the
    unit performing the loot action. The method ensures that the GameObject's loot
    state is properly updated according to the specified LootState and the unit involved
    in the loot operation.
  parameters:
  - name: s
    description: The LootState value that defines the current loot state of the GameObject.
      This can be one of several predefined states such as LOOT_NONE, LOOT_UNLOOTED,
      LOOT_LOOTED, etc.
  - name: unit
    description: The Unit object (typically a player) that is performing the loot
      action on this GameObject. This parameter determines which unit's actions will
      influence the loot state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: GameObject->SetLootState(LOOT_LOOTED, player);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'GameObject->SetLootState(LOOT_UNLOOTED, player); // Reset loot state after
      loot

      // This is commonly used in scripts or during quest completion events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player interacts with a GameObject to loot it. It's important to note that the
    method does not directly perform the looting action but rather sets the state
    of the GameObject for future looting actions. The implementation ensures that
    the GameObject's state is properly synchronized with the unit's looting actions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot states, potentially
    causing issues in quest completion or loot distribution. It's crucial to ensure
    that the LootState and Unit parameters are correctly set before calling this method.
