  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: GetOwnerInfo
  signature: int QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::GetOwnerInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the owner information identifier associated with the quest objective
    criteria manager instance.
  description: The GetOwnerInfo method returns an integer identifier that represents
    the owner of the quest objective criteria. This is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine which player or entity
    is associated with a specific set of quest objectives. The returned value often
    corresponds to a GUID or similar unique identifier within the game's internal
    systems. This method does not take any parameters and is read-only, making it
    safe for concurrent access. It is commonly used during quest progression checks
    and objective validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the owner identifier of the quest objective
    criteria. This typically corresponds to a player's GUID or entity identifier within
    the TrinityCore system. A return value of zero may indicate an invalid or unassigned
    owner.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int ownerId = questObjectiveCriteriaMgr.GetOwnerInfo();\nif (ownerId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Process the owner information\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest objective\
      \ owner ID: %d\", ownerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest management system and should only
    be called when the quest objective criteria manager instance has been properly
    initialized. The returned integer value may represent different types of owners
    (player, NPC, etc.) depending on how the quest was initiated.
