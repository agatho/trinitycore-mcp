documentation:
  brief: Loads graveyard zone data from the database into memory for use in the game
    world.
  description: The LoadGraveyardZones method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with graveyard zone information retrieved from the database. This method
    is typically called during server startup or world initialization to ensure that
    players can properly access graveyards and corpse retrieval mechanics. It processes
    records from the graveyard_zone table, mapping graveyard IDs to their respective
    zone IDs and associated faction information. The loaded data is used to determine
    valid graveyard locations for different player factions and zones within the game
    world.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabaseData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadGraveyardZones();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during the server's world loading phase and
    should not be called multiple times during runtime. The loaded graveyard data
    is cached in memory for fast lookup operations, so modifications to the database
    require a server restart to take effect.
