documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the MountManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the MountManager
    class, providing global access to the mount management system. This method ensures
    that only one instance of MountManager exists throughout the application lifecycle.
    The returned pointer can be used to access all mount-related functionality such
    as adding, removing, and managing player mounts. This is commonly used in game
    systems where mount data needs to be consistently accessed across different subsystems
    like player characters, world objects, or database operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton MountManager instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer to the singleton object; it never returns NULL under normal
    circumstances.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MountManager* mountMgr = MountManager::instance();

      Player* player = ...;

      mountMgr->AddMount(player, 12345); // Add a mount to player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Mount Data
    code: "MountManager* mgr = MountManager::instance();\nif (mgr)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ the mount manager to check if player has specific mount\n    bool hasMount\
      \ = mgr->HasMount(player, 67890);\n    // Or get list of all mounts for player\n\
      \    std::vector<uint32> mounts = mgr->GetPlayerMounts(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the singleton pattern which means that all calls to instance()
    will return the same object. The MountManager singleton is typically initialized
    during server startup and should be available throughout the application lifecycle.
    Be cautious when using this in multi-threaded environments where thread safety
    of the returned instance must be considered.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton pattern implementation, excessive use of global
    access points can make code harder to test and maintain. Also, accessing MountManager
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization may lead to race conditions
    if the manager's internal state is modified concurrently.
