  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::HasCleaveTargets() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat state analyzer has any cleave targets available
    for processing.
  description: The HasCleaveTargets method checks if there are any valid cleave targets
    currently registered within the combat state analyzer. This method is typically
    used in AI behavior systems to determine if a unit should perform a cleave attack,
    which is an ability that hits multiple nearby enemies. The method evaluates the
    internal target list and returns true if at least one valid cleave target exists,
    otherwise false. This functionality is crucial for melee combat logic where units
    may have multiple targets within their cleave range.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether cleave targets are present.
    True indicates that there are valid cleave targets available for processing; false
    indicates no cleave targets exist or they are all invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.HasCleaveTargets()) {\n    // Perform cleave attack logic\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(target, CLEAVE_SPELL_ID);\n} else {\n    // Fallback to\
      \ single target attack\n    unit->Attack(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state management of combat targets and
    should be called after target selection has been performed. The method does not
    perform any target validation itself but assumes that targets have already been
    filtered for validity. Performance is generally optimal as it only checks a flag
    or count of targets.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatStateAnalyzer instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing uninitialized data structures could lead to
    undefined behavior. This method should not be used in scenarios where target validity
    needs to be re-evaluated during combat execution.
