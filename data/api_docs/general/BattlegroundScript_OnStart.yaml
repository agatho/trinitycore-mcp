documentation:
  brief: Executes custom logic when a battleground instance begins
  description: The OnStart method is a virtual callback function in the BattlegroundScript
    class that is invoked when a battleground instance starts. This method allows
    developers to implement custom behavior, such as initializing game objects, setting
    up initial conditions, or triggering events that should occur at the beginning
    of a battleground match. It is called once per battleground instance and provides
    an opportunity to modify or extend the default battleground startup behavior without
    altering core TrinityCore functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "class MyBattlegroundScript : public BattlegroundScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  MyBattlegroundScript() : BattlegroundScript(\"MyBattleground\") {}\n\n  \
      \  void OnStart() override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when battleground\
      \ starts\n        sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_STARTED);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the battleground initialization phase, before
    any players have joined or any gameplay has begun. It's recommended to avoid heavy
    operations in this method as it may affect the battleground startup timing. The
    method should be thread-safe and not block execution for extended periods.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify player data or game state directly within this
    method without proper synchronization, as the battleground might not be fully
    initialized yet. Avoid performing database operations that could cause delays
    in battleground start-up.
