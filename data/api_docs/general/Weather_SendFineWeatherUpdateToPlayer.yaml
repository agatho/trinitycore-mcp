documentation:
  brief: Sends a fine weather update to the specified player.
  description: The SendFineWeatherUpdateToPlayer method is responsible for updating
    a player's client with the current fine weather conditions. This method ensures
    that the player's environment reflects clear, pleasant weather without any precipitation
    or atmospheric disturbances. It typically gets invoked when transitioning from
    a weather state (such as rain or storm) to a clear state, or when a player logs
    in during fine weather. The update is sent directly to the player's client via
    network packets, ensuring visual and auditory consistency with the game world's
    current weather settings.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Fine Weather Update to a Player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      Weather* weather = ...; // Assume weather instance is available

      weather->SendFineWeatherUpdateToPlayer(targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's network layer to send weather
    updates. It should only be called when the server has confirmed that the player's
    current weather state is fine (clear). The method does not perform any validation
    on the weather state itself, so it's expected that callers ensure the appropriate
    context before invoking this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the weather state is actually
    fine can lead to visual inconsistencies for players. Additionally, since this
    method sends direct network updates, excessive or unnecessary calls may impact
    performance or cause client-side lag.
