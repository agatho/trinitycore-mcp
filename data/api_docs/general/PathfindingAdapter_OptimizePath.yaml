  method: OptimizePath
  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::OptimizePath(MovementPath & path)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes a movement path by removing unnecessary waypoints and improving
    efficiency.
  description: The OptimizePath method processes a given MovementPath object to reduce
    the number of waypoints while maintaining the overall route validity. This optimization
    is crucial for performance in World of Warcraft's AI systems, as it minimizes
    the computational overhead during pathfinding operations. The method modifies
    the input path in-place, ensuring that the resulting path is both shorter and
    more efficient without compromising the ability of units to navigate to their
    destination. It typically removes redundant or closely spaced waypoints that do
    not contribute meaningfully to the path's accuracy.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to a MovementPath object containing the waypoints to be
      optimized. The method modifies this object in-place, removing unnecessary waypoints
      and adjusting the path for improved efficiency.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Optimization
    code: 'MovementPath myPath;

      // ... populate myPath with waypoints ...

      PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.OptimizePath(myPath);

      // myPath now contains the optimized version'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing Path Before Unit Movement
    code: 'Unit* unit = ...;

      MovementPath path;

      // ... generate path for unit ...

      PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.OptimizePath(path);

      unit->MoveWithPath(path);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after generating a raw path to improve performance.
    It assumes that the input path has valid waypoints and does not validate the integrity
    of the path before optimization. The optimization process may alter the exact
    positioning of waypoints but maintains navigational accuracy.
  warnings: Calling this method on an empty or invalid MovementPath can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the path contains at least two waypoints before calling
    OptimizePath, as a single waypoint cannot be optimized.
