  class: World
  method: ShutdownCancel
  signature: uint32 World::ShutdownCancel()
documentation:
  brief: Cancels an ongoing server shutdown process and returns the remaining time
    in seconds before shutdown would have occurred.
  description: The ShutdownCancel method is used to abort a scheduled server shutdown
    that was previously initiated by calling the ShutdownInitiate method. When invoked,
    this function cancels the shutdown timer and resets the shutdown state. It returns
    the number of seconds that remained until the shutdown would have taken place
    before it was canceled. This allows for dynamic control over server maintenance
    scheduling, enabling administrators or scripts to prevent an unintended shutdown
    if conditions change. The method is typically used in conjunction with World::ShutdownInitiate
    to provide a complete shutdown management interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of seconds that remained
    until the scheduled shutdown would have occurred before it was canceled. If no
    shutdown was scheduled, the return value will be zero.
  examples:
  - title: Canceling a Scheduled Shutdown
    code: "uint32 remainingTime = sWorld->ShutdownCancel();\nif (remainingTime > 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Shutdown canceled. %u seconds remained.\", remainingTime);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No shutdown was scheduled to cancel.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a shutdown has been previously initiated using ShutdownInitiate.
    It is not thread-safe and should be called from the main game loop or a context
    where it's safe to modify global server state. The function does not perform any
    logging or notification of the cancellation; it simply resets internal shutdown
    timers.
  warnings: Calling this method without first initiating a shutdown via ShutdownInitiate
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values. It should only be
    used when a shutdown has been scheduled and is intended to be canceled.
