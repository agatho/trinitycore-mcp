  signature: int Player::CanUninviteFromGroup(int guidMember, int partyIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player can be removed from a group.
  description: This method determines whether a player can be uninvited from a group,
    returning an integer value that indicates the success or failure of the operation.
    It is typically used in group management scenarios where players need to be removed
    from a party or raid group. The method evaluates various conditions such as group
    leadership status and player permissions to determine if removal is allowed.
  parameters:
  - name: guidMember
    description: The GUID of the player being removed from the group. This represents
      the unique identifier of the target player.
  - name: partyIndex
    description: The index of the party or raid group where the player is located.
      This helps identify which group the player belongs to.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating whether the uninvite operation is allowed.
    A return value of 0 means the player can be removed, while other values may indicate
    various failure conditions such as insufficient permissions or invalid group state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int result = player->CanUninviteFromGroup(123456, 0);\nif (result == 0)\
      \ {\n    // Player can be removed from group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's group management
    system and may involve checking player permissions, group leadership status, and
    other game mechanics. It should be used carefully as it affects group stability
    and player experience.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; instead, use
    the appropriate group management methods like RemoveFromGroup or UninviteFromGroup.
    Direct usage may lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the player is not properly
    removed from the group.
