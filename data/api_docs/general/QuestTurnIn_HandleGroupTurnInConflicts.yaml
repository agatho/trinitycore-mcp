  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: HandleGroupTurnInConflicts
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::HandleGroupTurnInConflicts(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves quest turn-in conflicts within a group for a specified quest ID.
  description: The HandleGroupTurnInConflicts method is responsible for managing and
    resolving any inconsistencies or conflicts that may arise when multiple group
    members attempt to turn in the same quest. This typically occurs when players
    in a group have different progress states on a shared quest, such as one player
    completing the quest while others are still working toward completion. The method
    ensures that only valid quest turn-ins are processed, preventing duplicate rewards
    or inconsistent quest state updates across group members. It is commonly invoked
    during group quest completion scenarios to maintain synchronization and prevent
    game mechanics disruptions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in the quest turn-in process. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest for which turn-in conflicts
      are being resolved. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group quest completion
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      questTurnIn->HandleGroupTurnInConflicts(playerGroup, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore quest system
    when group members attempt to turn in a quest. Developers should ensure that the
    group and quest ID are valid before invoking this method to prevent unexpected
    behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Invoking this method with an invalid group pointer or non-existent quest
    ID can lead to undefined behavior or server crashes. Always validate inputs before
    calling this function.
