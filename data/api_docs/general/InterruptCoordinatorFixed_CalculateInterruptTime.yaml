  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: CalculateInterruptTime
  signature: uint32 InterruptCoordinatorFixed::CalculateInterruptTime(const CastingSpellInfo
    & castInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the interrupt time for a casting spell based on the provided casting
    information.
  description: The CalculateInterruptTime method determines the duration in milliseconds
    that a spell will remain in an interrupted state after being disrupted during
    casting. This calculation is essential for managing spell mechanics such as channeling
    interruptions, cast time modifications, and cooldowns related to spell interruption
    events. The method uses the CastingSpellInfo structure to determine base interrupt
    timing, which may be influenced by factors like caster's abilities, target status,
    or environmental conditions. This function is typically invoked when a spell casting
    is interrupted by external factors such as movement, damage, or other game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the interrupt time in milliseconds.
    This value indicates how long the spell interruption effect will last before allowing
    the caster to resume or restart the spell casting process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed interruptCoordinator;

      CastingSpellInfo castInfo;

      // ... populate castInfo with relevant data ...

      uint32 interruptTime = interruptCoordinator.CalculateInterruptTime(castInfo);

      // interruptTime now contains the calculated interrupt duration in milliseconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell interruption system and should only be called
    when a spell casting has actually been interrupted. The implementation likely
    takes into account various spell properties, caster state, and game mechanics
    to compute accurate interrupt durations.
