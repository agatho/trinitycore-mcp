  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: UpdateExplorationRate
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::UpdateExplorationRate(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the exploration rate for a specified bot based on its GUID.
  description: The UpdateExplorationRate method is responsible for recalculating and
    adjusting the exploration rate of a specific bot within the BehaviorAdaptation
    system. This function takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID) as input and modifies
    its exploration behavior, likely affecting how aggressively or efficiently the
    bot explores its environment. The method is typically invoked during gameplay
    to dynamically adjust bot behavior based on environmental changes or player interactions.
    It may involve internal calculations related to exploration efficiency, area coverage,
    or quest progression tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose exploration rate needs
      to be updated. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the TrinityCore
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BehaviorAdaptation behavior;

      behavior.UpdateExplorationRate(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Bot Selection
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = GetActiveBotGuids();\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids)\n{\n    behavior.UpdateExplorationRate(guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal exploration tracking systems and
    may have performance implications if called frequently. It should only be invoked
    for valid bot entities to prevent undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an existing bot in the
    world; otherwise, calling this method could result in memory access violations
    or unexpected behavior. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops without
    proper throttling.
