  class: Quest
  method: SetEventIdForQuest
  signature: void Quest::SetEventIdForQuest(uint16 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the event ID for a quest to trigger specific game events.
  description: This method assigns a unique event identifier to a quest, allowing
    the game to track and manage quest-related events such as quest completion, objective
    progression, or special in-game triggers. The event ID is used internally by TrinityCore
    to determine how quests interact with world events and dynamic content. This method
    is typically called during quest initialization or when setting up quest-specific
    event handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier for the quest event, ranging from 0 to 65535
      (uint16). This ID must be unique within the context of the quest and is used
      to link the quest to specific game events or triggers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Event ID for Quest
    code: 'Quest* quest = new Quest();

      quest->SetEventIdForQuest(1001);

      // This sets the event ID to 1001 for the quest'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during quest initialization or when setting
    up event-based quest mechanics. The event ID is stored in the quest's internal
    data structure and used by TrinityCore's event system to manage quest-related
    triggers.
  warnings: Improper use of event IDs can cause quests to not trigger correctly or
    conflict with other quests. Event IDs must be unique within a quest's context
    to avoid conflicts.
