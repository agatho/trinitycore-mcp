documentation:
  brief: Returns the cooldown timestamp for creating calendar events for this session.
  description: This method retrieves the cooldown time stamp that determines when
    a player can next create a calendar event. In World of Warcraft, players are subject
    to a cooldown period after creating calendar events to prevent spamming. The returned
    value represents a Unix timestamp indicating the earliest time at which the player
    can create another event. If the current time is earlier than this timestamp,
    the player must wait before creating a new event. This mechanism helps maintain
    game balance and prevents excessive use of the calendar system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the player will be
    allowed to create another calendar event. If zero or in the past, the player can
    create an event immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player can create a calendar event
    code: "time_t cooldown = session->GetCalendarEventCreationCooldown();\nif (time(nullptr)\
      \ >= cooldown)\n{\n    // Player can create an event\n    // Proceed with event\
      \ creation logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player must wait until cooldown time\n\
      \    uint32 secondsToWait = static_cast<uint32>(cooldown - time(nullptr));\n\
      \    // Send cooldown message to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the calendar event creation
    logic to enforce rate limiting. The actual cooldown duration is determined by
    the game's internal configuration and may vary based on player level or other
    factors. This value is usually cached per session and updated when events are
    created.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a Unix timestamp, not a duration. Always
    compare against current time using time(nullptr) to determine if the cooldown
    has expired. Do not assume the returned value is always in the future - it may
    be in the past if the cooldown has already expired.
