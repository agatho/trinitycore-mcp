documentation:
  brief: Initializes a PlayerAI instance with the provided player reference
  description: The PlayerAI constructor initializes the AI system for a specific player
    character. This method sets up the internal state and references needed for the
    player's AI behavior. The constructor takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the player identifier, which is used to associate the AI with the correct player
    instance in the game world. This initialization is typically called during player
    login or when AI functionality is enabled for a character.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter must point to a valid player GUID value that exists in
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic PlayerAI Initialization
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      PlayerAI* ai = new PlayerAI(&playerId);

      // AI is now initialized for player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: PlayerAI in Game Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    int* playerId = &player->GetGUID();\n\
      \    PlayerAI* ai = new PlayerAI(playerId);\n    // Set up AI behavior for the\
      \ logged-in player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The PlayerAI constructor does not perform any validation on the provided
    player pointer. It is assumed that the caller has already validated that the player
    GUID points to a valid, existing player in the game world. The AI system will
    use this reference throughout the player's session until explicitly destroyed.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer for the player parameter may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the player GUID is valid before
    calling this constructor. This constructor should only be called once per player
    instance to avoid memory leaks or duplicate AI initialization.
