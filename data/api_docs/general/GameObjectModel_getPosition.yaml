documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current position value of the game object model.
  description: The getPosition method returns a constant reference to an integer representing
    the current position state or index of the GameObjectModel instance. This position
    typically corresponds to the model's location within a specific coordinate system
    or animation sequence. The returned reference allows for efficient access without
    copying the underlying value, and the const qualifier ensures that the position
    cannot be modified through this interface. In the context of TrinityCore's game
    object handling, this method is commonly used to query the current state of dynamic
    models or to synchronize model positions with server-side data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current position value
    of the GameObjectModel. The specific meaning of this integer depends on the context
    in which the model is being used, potentially indicating a coordinate value, animation
    frame index, or state identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Retrieval
    code: 'GameObjectModel* model = ...;

      const int& position = model->getPosition();

      // Use position value for further processing

      printf("Current position: %d\n", position);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Position Comparison in Game Logic
    code: "GameObjectModel* model1 = ...;\nGameObjectModel* model2 = ...;\nif (model1->getPosition()\
      \ == model2->getPosition()) {\n    // Models are at the same position\n    printf(\"\
      Models are aligned\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a const reference, which means the returned value should
    not be modified. This design prevents accidental modification while providing
    efficient access to the internal position data. The actual integer value represents
    an abstract position within the model's context and may vary depending on whether
    it's used for spatial coordinates, animation states, or other game-specific purposes.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing the returned reference beyond the lifetime of
    the GameObjectModel instance, as this could lead to dangling references. Additionally,
    since the return value is a const reference, any attempt to modify the position
    through this interface will result in compilation errors.
