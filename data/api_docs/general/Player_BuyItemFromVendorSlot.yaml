  class: Player
  method: BuyItemFromVendorSlot
  signature: bool Player::BuyItemFromVendorSlot(int vendorguid, uint32 vendorslot,
    uint32 item, uint32 count, uint8 bag, uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: BuyItemFromVendorSlot attempts to purchase an item from a vendor using the
    specified vendor GUID and slot.
  description: This method facilitates purchasing items from NPCs (non-player characters)
    in World of Warcraft, specifically from vendors. It allows players to buy items
    by specifying the vendor's GUID, the vendor's slot number, and the item ID. The
    method handles the transaction between player and vendor, including checking if
    the player has sufficient gold and if the item is available for purchase. It also
    manages inventory space and ensures proper item stacking when necessary. This
    function is typically used in scripts or game mechanics where players interact
    with vendors to acquire items.
  parameters:
  - name: vendorguid
    description: The GUID of the vendor NPC from which the item will be purchased.
      This identifies the specific vendor within the game world.
  - name: vendorslot
    description: The slot number on the vendor's menu from which the item will be
      purchased. This corresponds to a specific item in the vendor's list.
  - name: item
    description: The item ID of the item being purchased. This identifies the specific
      item within the game world that the player wants to buy.
  - name: count
    description: The quantity of items to purchase. This determines how many of the
      specified item will be bought.
  - name: bag
    description: The bag slot where the purchased item should be placed. This specifies
      which bag (or bag type) to place the item in, or 0 for default inventory space.
  - name: slot
    description: The specific slot within the bag where the purchased item should
      be placed. This specifies the exact location within the bag where the item will
      be stored.
  returns: Returns true if the purchase was successful, false otherwise. The method
    returns false if the player does not have enough gold, if the item is not available
    for purchase, or if there isn't sufficient space in the inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 vendorGuid = 12345;

      uint32 vendorSlot = 0;

      uint32 itemID = 12345;

      uint32 count = 1;

      uint8 bag = 0;

      uint8 slot = 0;

      bool success = player->BuyItemFromVendorSlot(vendorGuid, vendorSlot, itemID,
      count, bag, slot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with error handling
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint32 vendorGuid = 12345;\nuint32 vendorSlot\
      \ = 0;\nuint32 itemID = 12345;\nuint32 count = 1;\nuint8 bag = 0;\nuint8 slot\
      \ = 0;\nbool success = player->BuyItemFromVendorSlot(vendorGuid, vendorSlot,\
      \ itemID, count, bag, slot);\nif (!success)\n{\n    // Handle error\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Purchase failed.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the World of Warcraft's vendor interaction system
    and requires proper handling of gold transactions, inventory space, and item stacking.
    It should be used carefully to avoid game mechanics issues or exploits. The method
    may fail silently if the player lacks sufficient gold or if the item is not available
    for purchase.
  warnings: This method does not check whether the vendor is actually a vendor or
    whether the vendor slot is valid. It also does not verify that the item ID corresponds
    to an actual item in the game world, which could lead to incorrect behavior or
    errors if used improperly.
