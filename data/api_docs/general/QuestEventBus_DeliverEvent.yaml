  signature: bool QuestEventBus::DeliverEvent(BotAI * subscriber, const QuestEvent
    & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers a quest event to a specified bot AI subscriber.
  description: The QuestEventBus::DeliverEvent method is responsible for routing and
    delivering quest-related events to subscribed bot AIs. This method ensures that
    when a quest-related occurrence happens in the game world, such as quest acceptance,
    completion, or objective updates, the appropriate bot AI is notified and can respond
    accordingly. The method takes a pointer to a BotAI subscriber and a const reference
    to a QuestEvent, then processes the event for that specific subscriber. It returns
    true if the event was successfully delivered and handled by the subscriber, or
    false if delivery failed or was not processed.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: A pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive and process the
      quest event. Must be a valid pointer to an active bot AI object.
  - name: event
    description: A const reference to the QuestEvent structure containing the details
      of the event being delivered. This includes information such as quest ID, event
      type, and associated data.
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully delivered and processed by the
    subscriber; returns false if delivery failed or the event could not be handled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: "BotAI* bot = ...;\nQuestEvent questEvent;\nquestEvent.questId = 12345;\n\
      questEvent.type = QuestEventType::QUEST_ACCEPTED;\nbool success = sQuestEventBus->DeliverEvent(bot,\
      \ questEvent);\nif (success) {\n    // Event was delivered successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Delivery Result
    code: "BotAI* bot = GetActiveBot();\nQuestEvent event;\nevent.questId = 67890;\n\
      event.type = QuestEventType::QUEST_COMPLETE;\nif (sQuestEventBus->DeliverEvent(bot,\
      \ event)) {\n    // Proceed with post-completion logic\n    bot->OnQuestComplete(event.questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log error or retry mechanism\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to\
      \ deliver quest completion event to bot %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's quest event system and is typically
    used internally by the core quest management logic. It assumes that the BotAI
    instance is properly initialized and registered with the event bus before attempting
    delivery. The method does not perform any validation on the BotAI pointer or QuestEvent
    data beyond basic null checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an active bot AI object, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also, be aware
    that delivering events to inactive or unregistered bots can lead to failed deliveries
    without clear error reporting.
