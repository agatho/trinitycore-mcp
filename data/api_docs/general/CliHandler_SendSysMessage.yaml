  signature: void CliHandler::SendSysMessage(int param0, bool escapeCharacters)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a system message to the client interface with optional character escaping.
  description: The SendSysMessage method is used within the TrinityCore server's command-line
    interface (CLI) handler to transmit system messages to connected clients. This
    function allows for displaying informational, warning, or error messages in a
    standardized format. The method supports an optional parameter to escape special
    characters in the message content, which helps prevent issues with CLI parsing
    or display formatting. It is typically invoked by console commands or administrative
    tools to communicate server status, configuration changes, or user feedback directly
    to the interface.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer identifier that determines the type or category of system
      message being sent. This value may map to predefined message types within the
      CLI handler's internal message system.
  - name: escapeCharacters
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether special characters in the message
      content should be escaped before transmission. When true, characters such as
      quotes or backslashes are properly encoded to prevent parsing errors in the
      CLI output.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with character escaping enabled
    code: handler->SendSysMessage(1001, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a system message without escaping characters
    code: handler->SendSysMessage(2005, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the CLI handler and is primarily
    intended for server-side administrative communication. The param0 value should
    be carefully chosen to match predefined message categories in the system to ensure
    proper formatting and handling by the client interface.
