  class: SpawnMetadata
  method: SpawnMetadata
  signature: void SpawnMetadata::SpawnMetadata(SpawnObjectType t)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpawnMetadata object with the specified spawn object type.
  description: The SpawnMetadata constructor initializes a new metadata object for
    tracking spawn-related information in the TrinityCore world server. This method
    sets up internal state based on the provided spawn object type, which determines
    how the metadata will be handled during creature, game object, or other spawn
    operations. The constructor is typically called internally by the core systems
    when creating spawn entries for entities in the world. It prepares the object
    for tracking spawn-related data such as spawn coordinates, respawn timers, and
    associated spawn groups.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The type of spawn object this metadata represents. Valid values include
      creature, gameobject, or other spawnable entity types defined in SpawnObjectType
      enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating SpawnMetadata for a Creature
    code: 'SpawnMetadata creatureMeta(SpawnObjectType::Creature);

      // Initializes metadata for tracking creature spawn information'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating SpawnMetadata for a GameObject
    code: 'SpawnObjectType type = SpawnObjectType::GameObject;

      SpawnMetadata goMeta(type);

      // Sets up metadata for game object spawn tracking'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during world initialization or when
    spawning entities. The SpawnObjectType parameter determines the internal data
    structure and behavior of the metadata object. Developers should not directly
    instantiate this class without proper context as it's designed to be used internally
    by the core spawn management systems.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you're implementing custom
    spawn logic. The SpawnMetadata class is intended for internal use within TrinityCore's
    spawn system and may have dependencies on other subsystems that are not immediately
    obvious.
