  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void MonkAI::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Monk AI's rotation based on current target and combat state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat rotation sequence for a Monk AI character. This method
    evaluates the current target, available abilities, resource levels, and combat
    conditions to select the most effective ability or action to perform next. It
    integrates with the broader Monk AI system to ensure optimal spell casting, ability
    usage, and overall combat performance during encounters. The method typically
    operates within the game's update loop and may modify the AI's internal state
    or action queue.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier. This parameter
      is used to determine which entity the Monk AI should focus on during rotation
      updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateRotation Usage
    code: 'int currentTarget = 12345;

      monkAI->UpdateRotation(&currentTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    int targetId = GetTargetId();\n    if (targetId !=\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        monkAI->UpdateRotation(&targetId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may interact
    with various Monk-specific mechanics such as chi tracking, brewing effects, and
    stance management. The target parameter should be validated before passing to
    ensure it represents a valid combat entity.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null target pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the target integer points to a valid game object identifier before
    calling this method.
