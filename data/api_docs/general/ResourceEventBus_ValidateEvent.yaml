  method: ValidateEvent
  signature: bool ResourceEventBus::ValidateEvent(const ResourceEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given resource event is properly formatted and contains
    valid data.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a ResourceEvent object meets all
    required criteria for validity within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    verifying that essential fields such as event type, associated resources, and
    timestamps are correctly set and within acceptable ranges. The method ensures
    data integrity before processing events in the resource management system. It
    is typically called prior to event handling or dispatching to prevent invalid
    or malformed events from causing system errors or unexpected behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided ResourceEvent is valid and contains properly
    formatted data; otherwise returns false if any validation checks fail.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "ResourceEvent event;\n// ... populate event with data ...\nbool isValid\
      \ = eventBus.ValidateEvent(event);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with event\
      \ handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks on event structure and field values but does
    not modify the input event object. It's designed to be lightweight for frequent
    use during event processing.
