  class: Spell
  method: GetDelayMoment
  signature: uint64 Spell::GetDelayMoment() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the delay moment when a spell is cast, indicating when the spell
    will complete its casting process.
  description: The GetDelayMoment method retrieves the timestamp at which a spell
    will finish its casting process. This value represents the time when the spell's
    casting will complete, typically used in conjunction with the current game time
    to determine when a spell will become available for use again. The method is commonly
    used in spell handling logic and can be crucial for managing spell cooldowns and
    timing mechanics within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the timestamp (in milliseconds) when
    the spell will finish casting, which can be used to determine when the spell becomes
    available for use again.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint64 delayMoment = spell->GetDelayMoment();\nif (delayMoment > getMSTime())\
      \ {\n    // Spell is still on cooldown\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with time-based calculations
    to determine spell cooldowns. The returned value is usually compared against the
    current game time to check if a spell can be cast again.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always reflect the actual
    delay moment depending on how the spell was initialized or whether it's a delayed
    spell. Ensure proper timing checks are performed before relying on this value
    for cooldown calculations.
