api:
  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: LearnFromCombatOutcome
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::LearnFromCombatOutcome(Player * player,
    bool victory, float performance)
documentation:
  brief: Updates player pattern recognition data based on combat outcome and performance
    metrics.
  description: The LearnFromCombatOutcome method processes the result of a combat
    encounter to enhance the player's pattern recognition abilities. It takes into
    account whether the player won or lost the fight, along with a performance score
    that reflects how effectively they executed their strategy during combat. This
    method is typically invoked after a PvP or PvE engagement concludes, allowing
    the game to adjust and improve the player's tactical awareness and decision-making
    skills over time. The system uses this data to refine AI behavior patterns and
    potentially unlock new abilities or modify existing ones related to combat recognition.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose pattern recognition data will
      be updated based on the combat outcome.
  - name: victory
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player achieved victory in the
      combat encounter (true = victory, false = defeat).
  - name: performance
    description: A floating-point value representing the player's performance during
      combat, typically ranging from 0.0 (poor) to 1.0 (excellent), used to quantify
      tactical execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat end handler
    code: "void OnCombatEnd(Player* player, bool won, float perf)\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition::LearnFromCombatOutcome(player,\
      \ won, perf);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced example with performance scaling
    code: "void HandlePlayerVictory(Player* player)\n{\n    float performance = CalculateCombatPerformance(player);\n\
      \    PlayerPatternRecognition::LearnFromCombatOutcome(player, true, performance);\n\
      \    // Additional logic for skill progression or achievement unlocking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger pattern recognition system that may influence
    AI-driven gameplay elements such as enemy behavior adaptation and player skill
    advancement. The performance metric should be normalized between 0.0 and 1.0 for
    consistent results across different combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent undefined behavior. Avoid calling this function in high-frequency loops
    or during critical sections of code where performance is crucial.
