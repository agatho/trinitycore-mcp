documentation:
  brief: Updates the centroid positions of behavior clusters based on current member
    positions
  description: The UpdateCentroids method recalculates and updates the geometric center
    (centroid) of each behavior cluster in the AI system. This method is typically
    invoked during AI processing cycles to ensure that cluster centroids accurately
    reflect the current spatial distribution of entities assigned to those clusters.
    The centroids are used for various AI decision-making processes, such as determining
    group cohesion, movement patterns, and tactical positioning. The method iterates
    through all members of each cluster, computes their average position, and updates
    the cluster's centroid accordingly. This ensures that AI behaviors remain responsive
    to dynamic changes in entity positions within the game world.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Cycle
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI processing ...\n    behaviorCluster->UpdateCentroids();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI logic using updated centroids ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    accurate centroid calculations. The performance impact is generally low as it
    only processes cluster members, but frequent calls may add up in high-density
    AI scenarios. The method assumes that all cluster members have valid position
    data and that the cluster structure is properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of cluster members or
    with invalid position data may result in incorrect centroid calculations. Ensure
    that all entities within clusters have valid positions before calling this method
    to avoid NaN or inf values in centroid computations.
