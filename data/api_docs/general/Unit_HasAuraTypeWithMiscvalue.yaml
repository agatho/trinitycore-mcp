  class: Unit
  method: HasAuraTypeWithMiscvalue
  signature: bool Unit::HasAuraTypeWithMiscvalue(int auraType, int32 miscValue) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has an aura of a specific type with the given misc value.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit (such as a player or creature)
    possesses a specific aura type with a particular miscellaneous value. It is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to verify aura effects, particularly
    for checking if a unit has a specific debuff or buff that matches both the aura
    type and its misc value. The method returns true if the specified aura type with
    the given misc value exists on the unit, false otherwise. This functionality is
    crucial for game mechanics involving spell effects, status conditions, and combat
    systems.
  parameters:
  - name: auraType
    description: The aura type to check for (e.g., SPELL_AURA_MOD_DECREASE_SPEED).
      Valid values are typically defined by the AuraType enum in TrinityCore.
  - name: miscValue
    description: The miscellaneous value associated with the aura type. This represents
      a specific parameter of the aura, such as the amount of speed reduction or the
      effect of a spell.
  returns: Returns true if the unit has an aura of the specified type with the given
    misc value; otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking for Speed Reduction Aura
    code: "if (unit->HasAuraTypeWithMiscvalue(SPELL_AURA_MOD_DECREASE_SPEED, 10))\
      \ {\n    // Unit has a speed reduction aura with misc value 10\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Stun Aura
    code: "if (unit->HasAuraTypeWithMiscvalue(SPELL_AURA_MOD_STUN, 5)) {\n    // Unit\
      \ has a stun aura with misc value 5\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other aura-related methods
    like HasAura or HasAuraType to ensure precise checking of specific aura effects.
    Performance-wise, it's recommended to avoid frequent calls to this method in tight
    loops as it involves iterating through the unit's aura list.
  warnings: The method may not work correctly if the aura type or misc value is invalid
    or undefined. Care should be taken when using this method with non-standard spell
    effects, as it might lead to incorrect results if used improperly.
