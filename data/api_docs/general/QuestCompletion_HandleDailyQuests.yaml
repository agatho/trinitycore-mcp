  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleDailyQuests(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and completes daily quests for a specified player character
  description: The HandleDailyQuests method is responsible for managing the completion
    of daily quests assigned to a player character. This function typically iterates
    through the player's active daily quest log, checks their progress against quest
    requirements, and handles the reward distribution when quests are completed. It
    ensures that daily quest limitations are respected and that players receive appropriate
    rewards such as experience points, gold, or items. The method is commonly used
    in automated quest completion systems or during player logout/entry events to
    maintain quest state consistency.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose daily
      quests will be processed and completed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      QuestCompletion questHandler;

      questHandler.HandleDailyQuests(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Logout Event
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    QuestCompletion questHandler;\n\
      \    questHandler.HandleDailyQuests(player);\n    // Additional cleanup logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state for
    quest processing. It assumes that all necessary quest data has been loaded and
    validated. The implementation may involve database operations and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the player object is properly initialized and valid before
    invoking this function. Additionally, this method modifies the player's quest
    state, so it should not be called during quest progression events to avoid race
    conditions.
