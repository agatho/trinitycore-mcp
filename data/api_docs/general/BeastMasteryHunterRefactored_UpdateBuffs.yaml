documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's beast mastery buffs based on current pet state and aura
    effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying the
    various buff effects that are granted to a Beast Mastery hunter through their
    pet's presence and active auras. This includes updating stat bonuses, damage multipliers,
    and other gameplay modifiers that depend on the hunter's current beast companion.
    The method typically checks the state of the hunter's pet, evaluates active auras,
    and applies or removes buffs accordingly. It is commonly invoked during combat
    updates, pet state changes, or when aura effects expire or are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    hunter->UpdateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Pet State Change
    code: "void OnPetStateChanged(Pet* newPet)\n{\n    if (newPet)\n        hunter->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates or when pet state changes
    occur. It may involve performance considerations due to aura evaluations and stat
    recalculations. The method assumes that the hunter's pet state is valid and properly
    initialized before execution.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method without a valid pet or aura context
    can lead to incorrect buff application or stat calculations. Ensure that all related
    systems (pet, auras, stats) are in a consistent state before calling this method.
