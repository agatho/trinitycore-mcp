  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetOptions
  signature: uint32 LFGMgr::GetOptions()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current LFG options bitmask from the LFG manager.
  description: The GetOptions method returns a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
    the active LFG (Looking for Group) options configured within the LFG manager.
    This bitmask typically encodes various settings such as whether LFG is enabled,
    specific group types allowed, or other configuration flags that affect how players
    can join or create groups through the LFG system. The returned value should be
    interpreted using predefined bit masks to determine individual option states.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask representing the current LFG options. Each bit in the
    mask corresponds to a specific LFG configuration option, allowing for efficient
    storage and retrieval of multiple boolean flags within a single integer value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 options = sLFGMgr->GetOptions();\nif (options & LFG_OPTION_ENABLED)\n\
      {\n    // LFG system is enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the LFG system and may be called
    frequently during player session initialization or when checking group availability.
    The returned bitmask should not be modified directly; instead, use appropriate
    setter methods to change LFG options.
