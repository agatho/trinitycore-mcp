  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: DefendBase
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::DefendBase(GameObject * flag)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates defensive behavior for the base using the specified game object
    flag.
  description: The DefendBase method is used in advanced AI behavior management to
    trigger defensive actions around a base structure. It takes a GameObject pointer
    representing a flag or base marker and activates appropriate defensive mechanisms
    such as spawning guards, setting up patrols, or initiating combat readiness. This
    method is typically invoked during battleground or arena scenarios where base
    protection is required. The method does not return any value but modifies the
    internal state of the behavior manager to reflect active defense mode.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A pointer to a GameObject representing the base flag or marker that
      defines the defensive area. This object should be a valid game object with proper
      positioning and ownership within the world context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Script
    code: "void MyAI::OnBaseAttack(GameObject* flag)\n{\n    m_behaviorManager->DefendBase(flag);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Defensive Behavior with Error Handling
    code: "void AdvancedBehaviorManager::DefendBase(GameObject * flag)\n{\n    if\
      \ (!flag)\n        return;\n    \n    // Set base defense state\n    m_isDefending\
      \ = true;\n    m_defenseFlag = flag;\n    \n    // Spawn guards around the flag\n\
      \    SpawnGuardsAround(flag);\n    \n    // Set up patrol routes\n    SetupDefensePatrols();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GameObject parameter is properly initialized
    and exists in the world. The behavior manager should be in a valid state to process
    defensive actions. Performance may be impacted if multiple base defenses are activated
    simultaneously.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid GameObject pointer will likely cause undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the flag object is properly registered with the game world
    before calling this method.
