documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a ticket is closed
  description: The IsClosed method determines if a ticket has been closed in the TrinityCore
    system. This method is typically used to verify the current state of a ticket
    before performing operations such as reopening or updating it. In World of Warcraft's
    ticketing system, tickets can be in either an open or closed state, and this method
    provides a way to query that state programmatically. The method performs no side
    effects and simply returns a boolean value indicating the ticket's closure status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ticket is closed, false if it is open
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check ticket state
    code: "if (ticket->IsClosed()) {\n    // Handle closed ticket logic\n    printf(\"\
      Ticket is already closed\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle open ticket logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Ticket is still open\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsClosed in conditional logic for ticket management
    code: "void ProcessTicket(Ticket* ticket) {\n    if (!ticket->IsClosed()) {\n\
      \        // Only process open tickets\n        ticket->UpdateLastModified();\n\
      \        ticket->SetStatus(\"In Progress\");\n    } else {\n        // Closed\
      \ tickets should not be modified\n        printf(\"Cannot modify closed ticket\\\
      n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that accesses an internal state variable of
    the Ticket class. It's designed to be efficient and thread-safe for read operations,
    though modifications to the ticket state should be synchronized if accessed from
    multiple threads.
  warnings: Be aware that calling IsClosed() on a null pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Always ensure proper validation before invoking this method.
