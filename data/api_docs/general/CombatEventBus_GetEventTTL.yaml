  class: CombatEventBus
  method: GetEventTTL
  signature: uint32 CombatEventBus::GetEventTTL() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the time-to-live value for combat events in the event bus.
  description: The GetEventTTL method returns the configured time-to-live (TTL) duration,
    in milliseconds, for combat-related events stored within the CombatEventBus. This
    value determines how long combat events are retained before being automatically
    purged from the system. The TTL mechanism helps manage memory usage and ensures
    that stale combat data does not persist indefinitely. This is particularly important
    in high-frequency combat scenarios where event accumulation could otherwise lead
    to performance degradation or memory bloat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time-to-live duration in milliseconds for
    combat events. Events older than this duration will be removed from the event
    bus.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Combat Event TTL
    code: 'uint32 ttl = combatEventBus.GetEventTTL();

      TC_LOG_INFO("combat", "Combat event TTL is set to %u milliseconds", ttl);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TTL value is typically configured via server settings or hardcoded
    defaults within the TrinityCore implementation. This method is thread-safe and
    can be called from any context where the CombatEventBus instance is accessible.
