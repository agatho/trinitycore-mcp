  class: MageSpellCalculator
  method: CacheSpellData
  signature: void MageSpellCalculator::CacheSpellData(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Caches spell data for a specified Mage spell ID for efficient retrieval during
    calculations.
  description: The CacheSpellData method stores relevant spell information for a given
    Mage spell ID into an internal cache structure. This allows subsequent calculations
    or lookups to avoid expensive database queries or repeated computations. The method
    is typically invoked when initializing spell-related systems or when new spells
    are added to the Mage's spellbook. It ensures that spell data such as damage values,
    mana costs, and cooldowns are readily available for real-time spell processing
    during gameplay. This caching mechanism improves performance by reducing redundant
    data fetching operations.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the Mage spell to be cached. Must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MageSpellCalculator calculator;

      calculator.CacheSpellData(12345); // Caches data for Fireball spell'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Multiple Spells
    code: "MageSpellCalculator calculator;\nstd::vector<uint32> mageSpells = {12345,\
      \ 12346, 12347};\nfor (uint32 spellId : mageSpells)\n{\n    calculator.CacheSpellData(spellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the provided spellId is valid and exists in the game's
    spell database. If an invalid spell ID is passed, behavior may be undefined or
    result in a runtime error. The internal cache should be cleared periodically to
    prevent memory bloat during long sessions.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent spell IDs as it may
    cause crashes or inconsistent spell behavior. Ensure that the spell data has been
    properly loaded into the database before attempting to cache it.
