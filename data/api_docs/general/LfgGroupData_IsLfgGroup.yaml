  class: LfgGroupData
  method: IsLfgGroup
  signature: bool LfgGroupData::IsLfgGroup()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group is currently in a LFG (Looking for Group) state.
  description: The IsLfgGroup method checks if the current group data represents a
    group that is actively participating in the Looking for Group system. This method
    returns true when the group has been formed through the LFG interface and is waiting
    for or has received a matching party, and false otherwise. It's commonly used
    to differentiate between regular player groups and LFG-formed groups, which may
    have different behaviors in terms of loot distribution, experience sharing, and
    quest tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group is currently in an LFG state, indicating it was
    created through the Looking for Group system. Returns false if the group is a
    regular player-created group or not associated with LFG activities.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a group is LFG
    code: "if (groupData->IsLfgGroup()) {\n    // Handle LFG group logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      This group is an LFG group.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle regular group logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"This group is a regular group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking within the LfgGroupData class.
    It's important to ensure that the group data object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized or invalid group may lead to
    unexpected behavior.
