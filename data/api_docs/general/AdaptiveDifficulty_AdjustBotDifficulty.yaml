api:
  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: AdjustBotDifficulty
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::AdjustBotDifficulty(BotAI * bot, Player * opponent)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the difficulty level of a bot AI based on the player opponent's characteristics.
  description: The AdjustBotDifficulty method modifies the behavior and challenge
    level of a BotAI instance to match or adapt to the skill level, gear, and other
    attributes of the specified Player opponent. This ensures that bots provide an
    appropriate challenge without being too easy or too difficult for the player.
    The adjustment typically considers factors such as player level, item level, PvP
    statistics, and combat behavior patterns. This method is commonly used in adaptive
    difficulty systems within TrinityCore's AI framework to dynamically balance gameplay
    experiences.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose difficulty settings will be adjusted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: opponent
    description: Pointer to the Player instance representing the opponent against
      whom the bot's difficulty is being calibrated. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Difficulty Adjustment
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = ...;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...;

      AdaptiveDifficulty::AdjustBotDifficulty(myBot, targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Context
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetSession()->GetSecurity()\
      \ < SEC_MODERATOR)\n    {\n        BotAI* bot = GetRandomBot();\n        AdaptiveDifficulty::AdjustBotDifficulty(bot,\
      \ player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal AI parameters like attack power, defense
    strategies, spell usage frequency, and movement patterns. It may also interact
    with the bot's faction, quest data, or other AI-related subsystems to ensure realistic
    behavior adjustments.
  warnings: Ensure both 'bot' and 'opponent' pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrectly adjusted difficulty settings might
    lead to unbalanced gameplay or AI anomalies.
