api:
  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: UpdateFollowTarget
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateFollowTarget(Player * bot, Player *
    leader)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the follow target for a bot player based on the provided leader player.
  description: The UpdateFollowTarget method is responsible for managing the follower
    behavior of a bot player in relation to a designated leader player. It adjusts
    the bot's movement and targeting logic to maintain proper positioning relative
    to the leader, ensuring that the bot follows the leader within acceptable distance
    thresholds. This method is typically invoked during AI updates or when leader-follower
    relationships are established or modified. The implementation likely involves
    pathfinding calculations, distance checks, and state management to ensure smooth
    and realistic following behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will follow
      the leader. Must not be null.
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the leader whose movements
      the bot will follow. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UpdateFollowTarget
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player

      Player* leader = ...; // Get leader player

      LeaderFollowBehavior followBehavior;

      followBehavior.UpdateFollowTarget(bot, leader);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using UpdateFollowTarget in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* leader = GetLeader())\n\
      \    {\n        if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n        {\n            LeaderFollowBehavior\
      \ followBehavior;\n            followBehavior.UpdateFollowTarget(bot, leader);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the bot's movement system and may trigger
    pathfinding recalculations. It should be called regularly during AI update cycles
    to maintain proper follow behavior. The method assumes both players are valid
    and in the same map/instance.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'leader' parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null pointers could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method may have performance implications if called too frequently
    without proper throttling.
