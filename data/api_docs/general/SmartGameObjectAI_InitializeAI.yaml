documentation:
  brief: Initializes the SmartGameObjectAI instance, setting up internal state and
    preparing it for AI behavior execution.
  description: The InitializeAI method is responsible for initializing the SmartGameObjectAI
    class instance. It sets up internal variables, registers event handlers, and prepares
    the AI system for managing GameObject behaviors. This method is typically called
    during the GameObject's creation or activation phase, ensuring that all necessary
    components are properly configured before any AI logic begins executing. The initialization
    process may include setting up target selection criteria, configuring behavior
    parameters, and establishing communication with the SmartScript system. It serves
    as a critical setup step in the lifecycle of a smart GameObject AI.

    code: "void MyGameObject::OnSpawn()\n{\n    if (m_ai)\n    {\n        m_ai->InitializeAI();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the GameObject's lifetime,
    typically after the object has been fully constructed and configured. It is not
    intended to be called repeatedly as it may cause unexpected behavior or resource
    leaks.
