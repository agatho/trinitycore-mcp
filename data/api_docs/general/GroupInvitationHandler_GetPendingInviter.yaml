  signature: int GroupInvitationHandler::GetPendingInviter() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the player who issued the pending group invitation.
  description: The GetPendingInviter method returns the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the player who sent the current group invitation. This method is typically used
    within the GroupInvitationHandler class to determine which player initiated a
    pending group invite. The returned value represents the inviter's GUID and can
    be used to verify identity, check permissions, or perform actions related to the
    invitation. This method should only be called when there is an active pending
    invitation; otherwise, it may return an invalid or default GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the player who sent the pending group
    invitation. Returns 0 if no pending invitation exists or if the inviter GUID cannot
    be retrieved.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pending Inviter GUID
    code: "GroupInvitationHandler handler;\nint inviterGUID = handler.GetPendingInviter();\n\
      if (inviterGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Process the pending invitation from the specified\
      \ player\n    sLog->outString(\"Pending group invite from player GUID: %u\"\
      , inviterGUID);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"No pending group invitation.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that there is an active pending invitation in the handler's
    state. Developers should ensure proper state management before calling this method
    to avoid retrieving stale or invalid GUID values.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid pending invitation context may result
    in returning a default value (0) which could be misinterpreted as a valid player
    GUID. Always verify that an invitation exists before calling this method.
