  method: SetErrorRateThreshold
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::SetErrorRateThreshold(float errorsPerSecond)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the error rate threshold for bot health checks to determine when a bot
    is considered unhealthy.
  description: The SetErrorRateThreshold method configures the maximum allowed error
    rate per second for a bot's health checks. This threshold determines at what point
    a bot will be marked as having failed its health validation. The value is typically
    expressed as a floating-point number representing errors per second. When the
    actual error rate exceeds this threshold, the bot's health status may be flagged
    as critical or unhealthy, triggering potential corrective actions such as restarting
    the bot or alerting administrators. This method is used in conjunction with other
    health check mechanisms to maintain system stability and ensure bots operate within
    acceptable performance parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: errorsPerSecond
    description: The maximum allowable error rate per second for bot health checks.
      Valid values are positive floating-point numbers. A lower value indicates stricter
      health requirements, while a higher value allows more errors before considering
      the bot unhealthy.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Error Rate Threshold
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      healthCheck.SetErrorRateThreshold(0.5f); // Allow up to 0.5 errors per second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Strict Health Monitoring
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthCheck;

      healthCheck.SetErrorRateThreshold(0.1f); // Very strict - only 0.1 error per
      second allowed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the bot's operational reliability by setting
    a baseline for acceptable error rates. The threshold value should be carefully
    chosen based on expected bot behavior and system tolerance. Changes to this threshold
    may require corresponding updates to monitoring systems or alerting mechanisms.
  warnings: Setting the error rate threshold too low may cause false positives, where
    healthy bots are incorrectly flagged as failed. Conversely, setting it too high
    may allow unhealthy bots to continue operating without detection.
