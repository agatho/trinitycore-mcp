  method: IsInDragonridingZone
  signature: bool MountManager::IsInDragonridingZone(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is currently in a zone where dragonriding is allowed.
  description: The IsInDragonridingZone method determines whether the player character
    is located within a geographic area that supports dragonriding mechanics. This
    function evaluates the player's current zone or map boundaries against predefined
    dragonriding zones. It is typically used to validate whether a player can initiate
    or continue dragonriding actions, ensuring that the player is in an appropriate
    environment for this specific mount type. The method does not require any parameters
    as it internally accesses the player object from the MountManager context.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose zone location is being checked
      for dragonriding eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the player is in a zone where dragonriding is permitted,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the current geographic location allows
    for dragonriding mount usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (mountManager.IsInDragonridingZone(&player)) {\n    // Allow dragonriding\
      \ actions\n    player.StartDragonriding();\n} else {\n    // Prevent dragonriding\
      \ in invalid zones\n    player.SendSystemMessage(\"Dragonriding is not allowed\
      \ in this area.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Mount Logic
    code: "void Player::HandleMountAbility() {\n    if (IsInDragonridingZone(&this))\
      \ {\n        if (HasMount(MOUNT_TYPE_DRAGONRIDE)) {\n            // Activate\
      \ dragonriding\n            SetMounted(true);\n        }\n    } else {\n   \
      \     SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot use this mount here.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on zone data and map boundaries defined in the game's
    database or configuration files. It may be affected by dynamic zone changes or
    custom server modifications. The implementation likely uses internal player position
    tracking and zone ID comparisons to determine eligibility.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    This function should only be called when the player object is fully initialized
    and active.
