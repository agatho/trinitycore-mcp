  class: MountManager
  method: GetRidingSkill
  signature: uint32 MountManager::GetRidingSkill(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the riding skill level of the specified player.
  description: The GetRidingSkill method returns the current riding skill level of
    a player as stored in their character data. This value represents the player's
    proficiency in riding mounts, which is used to determine which mounts they can
    learn and ride. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing the player's
    ID or index and retrieves the corresponding riding skill value from the internal
    mount manager data structure. This is typically used during mount learning checks,
    mount validation, or when determining what flying mounts a character can access
    based on their skill level.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      in the system. This parameter should point to a valid player ID that corresponds
      to an active character in the game world.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the player's riding skill level. This
    value typically ranges from 0 (no skill) to maximum skill levels (e.g., 375 for
    max riding skill). A return value of 0 indicates that the player has no riding
    skill, while higher values indicate increasing proficiency.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 ridingSkill = mountManager->GetRidingSkill(&playerId);\n\
      if (ridingSkill >= 375)\n{\n    // Player can ride max-level flying mounts\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Mount Availability
    code: "int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nuint32 skillLevel = mountManager->GetRidingSkill(&playerId);\n\
      if (skillLevel >= 150)\n{\n    // Player can learn basic flying mounts\n   \
      \ player->LearnSpell(34090); // Example flying mount spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the mount system and may be called
    during character loading, mount learning, or mount validation processes. The method
    assumes that the player pointer points to a valid player object in the game world.
    It's important to note that this value might not reflect temporary skill modifications
    from buffs or temporary effects.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid player ID before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid or null pointer could result in undefined behavior.
    This method should only be called on players who are actually present in the game
    world and have loaded their character data.
