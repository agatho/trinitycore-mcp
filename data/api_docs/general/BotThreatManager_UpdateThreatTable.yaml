documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat table for bot units based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateThreatTable method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the threat levels of all bot units within the game world. It processes the threat
    data for each bot, recalculating their current threat values based on the time
    elapsed since the last update. This method ensures that bots maintain accurate
    threat tables which are essential for proper AI behavior, particularly in combat
    situations where threat determines which target a bot will attack next. The method
    typically runs as part of the game loop and is called with a delta time parameter
    to synchronize updates with the game's timing system.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all bot threat tables\n    sBotAI->GetThreatManager()->UpdateThreatTable(sWorld->getDiff());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly as part of the game's update cycle
    to ensure accurate threat management. The implementation likely involves iterating
    through all active bot units and updating their threat values based on combat
    actions, damage dealt, or other relevant factors.
