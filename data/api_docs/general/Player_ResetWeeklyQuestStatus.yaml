  brief: Resets the player's weekly quest status to allow for new quest completions.
  description: The ResetWeeklyQuestStatus method clears the player's weekly quest
    tracking data, allowing them to take on new weekly quests and reset their weekly
    quest progress. This method is typically used when a player needs to reset their
    weekly quest status, such as during a character reset or when starting a new weekly
    quest cycle. It ensures that the player's weekly quest log is cleared of any previous
    week's worth of quest data, enabling fresh quest tracking. The method operates
    on the player's internal quest tracking system and does not directly affect the
    quest database itself.

  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect the player's weekly
    quest tracking. It may not be suitable for all situations, particularly when quest
    progress needs to be preserved.
