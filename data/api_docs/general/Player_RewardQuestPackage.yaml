documentation:
  brief: Reward quest package to player
  description: This method rewards a quest package to the player, allowing them to
    receive items or rewards based on the specified quest package ID. It handles both
    context and item-specific reward mechanisms, enabling players to complete quest
    packages with specific conditions or item requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: questPackageId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest package to be rewarded. This determines
      which quest package will be processed for rewards.
  - name: context
    description: The context in which the reward is applied, typically representing
      the type of reward or condition. Valid values include 0 (default), 1 (item-specific),
      and other context types depending on game mechanics.
  - name: onlyItemId
    description: Optional parameter specifying a specific item ID to reward. If provided,
      only that item will be rewarded, otherwise the full quest package rewards are
      applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->RewardQuestPackage(12345, 0, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Item-specific reward example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest completion logic
    and may require proper context handling to ensure correct reward application.
    The method should be called after verifying that the player has completed the
    necessary requirements for the quest package.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in incorrect rewards or missing
    items, especially when using context values or specific item IDs. Care must be
    taken to ensure proper validation of quest package IDs and context types before
    calling this method.
