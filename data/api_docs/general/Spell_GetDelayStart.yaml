  method: GetDelayStart
  signature: uint64 Spell::GetDelayStart() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the delay start time for a spell in milliseconds
  description: This method retrieves the delay start time of a spell, which represents
    the time when the spell's casting or channeling process began. The value is typically
    used to determine when a spell's effects can be applied or when the spell becomes
    available for use again after its initial delay. This is particularly important
    in determining spell cooldowns and timing mechanics within World of Warcraft's
    combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the timestamp in milliseconds when the spell's delay started,
    typically used to calculate remaining cooldown time or determine when a spell
    can be cast again
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 delayStart = spell->GetDelayStart();

      uint64 currentTimestamp = getMSTime();

      uint64 remainingTime = delayStart + 2000 - currentTimestamp;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value is typically in milliseconds and represents the exact
    moment when the spell's delay began. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with cooldown calculations to determine when a spell becomes available for use
    again.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for determining spell cooldowns
    without considering other factors such as global cooldown or spell-specific modifiers.
    Using this value alone may lead to incorrect timing calculations.
