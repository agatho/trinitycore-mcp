documentation:
  brief: Initiates an early landing request for the player's taxi flight
  description: The RequestEarlyLanding method attempts to interrupt the current taxi
    flight and immediately land the player at the next available taxi node. This method
    is typically invoked when a player wishes to disembark from a flying mount before
    reaching their intended destination. The operation may fail if the player is not
    currently in a taxi flight, or if the flight path does not allow for early landing.
    The method returns true upon successful initiation of the early landing sequence,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is part of the game's transportation system
    and interacts with the player's current flight state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the early landing request was successfully initiated, false
    if the player is not currently on a taxi flight or if the operation could not
    be completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Early Landing Request
    code: "if (player->GetPlayerTaxi()->RequestEarlyLanding()) {\n    // Early landing\
      \ initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player %s requested early landing.\"\
      , player->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate early landing\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player %s failed to request early landing.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only works when the player is actively on a taxi flight. It does
    not guarantee immediate arrival at the next node, as the game engine may still
    process the remaining flight path before applying the early landing. The method
    should be called from within the player's context to ensure proper state handling.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active taxi flight will result in a
    failed operation and potentially unexpected behavior. It is recommended to check
    the player's current flight status before invoking this method to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
