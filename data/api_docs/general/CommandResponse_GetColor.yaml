  class: CommandResponse
  method: GetColor
  signature: uint32 CommandResponse::GetColor() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the color value associated with the command response for display
    purposes.
  description: The GetColor method returns a uint32 value representing the color code
    used to format the command response in the game client. This color is typically
    used to indicate the type or severity of the response, such as success, error,
    or warning messages. The returned value follows standard RGB color formatting
    conventions where each byte represents red, green, and blue components respectively.
    This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's command system to provide visual
    feedback to players executing game commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the color code for the command response. The
    value typically follows RGB format where the most significant byte represents
    red, the middle byte green, and the least significant byte blue. Common values
    might be 0x00FF00 for green (success), 0xFF0000 for red (error), or 0xFFFF00 for
    yellow (warning).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      uint32 color = response.GetColor();

      // Use the color value to format output in chat or log

      printf("Response color: 0x%08X\n", color);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Color in Command Handler
    code: "void HandleTestCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    CommandResponse response;\n\
      \    uint32 color = response.GetColor();\n    if (color == 0x00FF00) // Green\n\
      \    {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"Operation successful!\");\n    }\n\
      \    else if (color == 0xFF0000) // Red\n    {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"\
      Operation failed!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The color value returned by this method is typically set during the command
    response initialization and may be overridden by specific command implementations.
    Developers should be aware that the actual visual representation depends on how
    the client interprets the color code values. This method is thread-safe as it
    only reads immutable state.
  warnings: Ensure that color values are properly validated before use, especially
    when dealing with user-defined responses. Incorrect color codes may result in
    unexpected display behavior or visual artifacts in the game interface.
