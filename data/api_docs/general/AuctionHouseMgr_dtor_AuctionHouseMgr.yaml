documentation:
  brief: Destroys the AuctionHouseMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionHouseMgr class is responsible for cleaning
    up all allocated memory and resources used by the auction house management system.
    This includes releasing any held references to auctions, clearing internal data
    structures, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the manager is destroyed.
    The destructor is automatically invoked when an AuctionHouseMgr object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method ensures proper cleanup of auction data that may have been
    loaded from the database or cached in memory during server runtime.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AuctionHouseMgr
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    // AuctionHouseMgr is created on stack\n    AuctionHouseMgr\
      \ auctionMgr;\n    // When function exits, destructor automatically called\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for preventing
    memory leaks in the emulation environment. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically allocated with
    new. The AuctionHouseMgr is typically managed as a singleton or global instance
    within the TrinityCore server architecture.
