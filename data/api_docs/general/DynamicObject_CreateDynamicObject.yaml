  signature: bool DynamicObject::CreateDynamicObject(int guidlow, Unit * caster, const
    SpellInfo * spell, const int & pos, float radius, DynamicObjectType type, int
    spellVisual)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a dynamic object associated with a spell caster and position.
  description: The CreateDynamicObject method initializes and registers a dynamic
    object within the game world, typically used for visual effects or area-of-effect
    spells. It associates the object with a specific caster unit, spell information,
    and placement coordinates. The method handles the creation of temporary game entities
    that persist for a defined duration or until explicitly removed. This functionality
    is essential for implementing spells like fire traps, healing streams, or other
    environmental effects in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: guidlow
    description: Low GUID value used to uniquely identify the dynamic object within
      the server's object manager.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit that is casting the spell and owns this dynamic
      object. Must not be null.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing information about the
      spell that created this object. Must not be null.
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position where the dynamic
      object should be placed in the world. Typically corresponds to a location coordinate
      or index.
  - name: radius
    description: Float value defining the radius of the dynamic object's area of effect
      or visual range.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of dynamic object being created,
      such as area aura, spell visual, or trap.
  - name: spellVisual
    description: Integer identifier for a specific spell visual effect to be applied
      to this dynamic object.
  returns: Returns true if the dynamic object was successfully created and registered;
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, memory allocation
    issues, or internal server errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dynamic Object Creation
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();\nif (dynObj->CreateDynamicObject(12345,\
      \ playerUnit, spellInfo, 0, 5.0f, DYNAMIC_OBJECT_AREA_AURA, 9876)) {\n    //\
      \ Object created successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle creation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Spell Visual Dynamic Object
    code: "DynamicObject* trap = new DynamicObject();\nUnit* caster = player->GetVehicleBase();\n\
      const SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (trap->CreateDynamicObject(54321,\
      \ caster, spellInfo, 10, 3.0f, DYNAMIC_OBJECT_SPELL_VISUAL, 6789)) {\n    //\
      \ Trap created with specific visual effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell casting logic when a spell
    requires the creation of temporary world objects. The dynamic object will automatically
    be removed from the game world upon expiration or destruction, depending on its
    type and configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are valid before calling this method
    to prevent crashes or undefined behavior. The 'caster' and 'spell' parameters
    must not be null; otherwise, the method will likely fail or cause memory corruption.
