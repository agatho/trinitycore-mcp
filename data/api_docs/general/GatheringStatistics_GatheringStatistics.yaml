  brief: Initializes a new instance of the GatheringStatistics class for tracking
    and managing player gathering activity data.
  description: The GatheringStatistics constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GatheringStatistics class, which is designed to track and manage various statistics
    related to player gathering activities within the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes tracking the number of successful gathers, types of resources collected,
    and other relevant metrics for players engaged in gathering professions such as
    Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning. The constructor sets up internal data structures
    and initializes default values for statistical tracking, preparing the object
    for use in gathering-related game mechanics and player progression systems.

    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or external API
    calls. It only initializes internal member variables and data structures. The
    actual gathering statistics tracking must be enabled through other methods in
    the class.
