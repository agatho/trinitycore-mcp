documentation:
  brief: Reloads and updates zone data for bot positioning calculations
  description: The ReloadZones method refreshes the internal zone database used by
    the BotWorldPositioner class to determine valid positions and navigation paths
    for AI bots. This method ensures that any changes to zone boundaries, terrain
    data, or world objects are properly accounted for in subsequent bot positioning
    operations. The method typically gets invoked when zone data has been modified,
    such as during map reloads or when new zones are added to the game world.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.ReloadZones();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may cause temporary performance degradation as it rebuilds internal
    zone data structures. It should typically be called sparingly and only when necessary
    to ensure accurate positioning calculations.
