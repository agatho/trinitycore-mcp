documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Restoration Shaman AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The RestorationShamanRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the RestorationShamanRefactored AI class, setting up internal state and configuration
    for a restoration shaman character. This method prepares the bot for gameplay
    by configuring its abilities, spell selection, and behavior patterns specific
    to the restoration shaman class. It ensures that the bot is ready to perform restoration
    duties such as healing, mana management, and elemental support within the TrinityCore
    framework. The initialization process includes setting up target selection logic,
    spell cooldown tracking, and resource management strategies appropriate for a
    restoration shaman.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      RestorationShamanRefactored shamanBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The player
    object passed must be a valid, initialized Player object. This method does not
    perform any network communication or server interaction directly; it only sets
    up local AI state.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with a null player pointer as it will likely
    cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object remains valid for the
    lifetime of the RestorationShamanRefactored instance.
