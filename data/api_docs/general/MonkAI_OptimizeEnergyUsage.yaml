  method: OptimizeEnergyUsage
  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeEnergyUsage()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes energy usage for the Monk AI by managing resource allocation and
    ability selection based on current energy levels and combat state.
  description: The OptimizeEnergyUsage method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    how a Monk AI character utilizes its energy resources during combat. This method
    evaluates the current energy pool, available abilities that consume energy, and
    the overall combat situation to determine the most efficient usage pattern. It
    ensures that high-energy abilities are used strategically, prevents energy waste
    through unnecessary casts, and maintains optimal resource flow throughout the
    encounter. The method considers factors such as energy regeneration rate, ability
    cooldowns, and threat generation when making decisions about energy allocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    OptimizeEnergyUsage();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with energy-based ability selection
    code: "void MonkAI::OptimizeEnergyUsage()\n{\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY)\
      \ >= 40)\n    {\n        // Prefer high-energy abilities when available\n  \
      \      if (me->HasSpell(123456)) // Tiger Palm\n            me->CastSpell(me->GetVictim(),\
      \ 123456, true);\n    }\n    else if (me->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY) >= 20)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Use lower energy abilities to build up resources\n        if\
      \ (me->HasSpell(789012)) // Blackout Kick\n            me->CastSpell(me->GetVictim(),\
      \ 789012, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    optimal energy management. The implementation may vary between different Monk
    specializations (Windwalker, Mistweaver, Brewmaster) as each has distinct energy
    mechanics and ability priorities.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to inefficient energy
    usage, causing the Monk AI to waste resources or fail to utilize high-value abilities
    at optimal times. Ensure that all energy-based abilities are properly checked
    for availability before casting.
