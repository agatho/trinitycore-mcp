documentation:
  brief: Returns the bitmask of events this handler is subscribed to in the raid converted
    system
  description: The GetSubscribedEvents method retrieves the bitmask representing all
    event types that this RaidConvertedHandler instance is configured to handle. In
    TrinityCore's event-driven architecture for raid management and conversion logic,
    handlers must declare which events they wish to process by returning a bitmask
    of event flags. This method is typically called during the initialization or registration
    phase of the handler to determine its event subscription scope. The returned value
    is used internally by the core system to route appropriate events to this handler's
    processing methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer bitmask where each bit represents a specific event type that
    this handler subscribes to. The exact bit values and their meanings are defined
    by the RaidConvertedHandler event enumeration constants within the TrinityCore
    codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "RaidConvertedHandler* handler = new MyRaidConvertedHandler();\nint subscribedEvents\
      \ = handler->GetSubscribedEvents();\nif (subscribedEvents & RAID_EVENT_PLAYER_ENTERED)\n\
      {\n    // Handle player entered event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called during the handler's registration phase
    with the event system. The returned bitmask should remain constant throughout
    the handler's lifetime unless explicitly changed through a separate setter method.
    Implementation details may vary based on the specific event system architecture
    used by TrinityCore for raid management.
