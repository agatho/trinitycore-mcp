documentation:
  brief: Loads instance template data from the database into memory for use by the
    server.
  description: The LoadInstanceTemplate method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with instance template information retrieved from the database.
    This includes loading dungeon and raid templates, their associated maps, difficulty
    levels, and other relevant configuration data needed for managing player instances
    in World of Warcraft. The method is typically called during server startup or
    when reloading instance data dynamically. It ensures that all instance-related
    configurations are available for instance creation, player entry, and proper instance
    management throughout the game session.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance().LoadInstanceTemplate();\n\
      \    // Instance templates are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or database reload operations.
    It's important to note that this method performs database queries and populates
    internal caches, so it should not be called frequently during normal gameplay
    operations. The data loaded by this method is used extensively throughout the
    instance management system.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. It's recommended to only call this during initialization
    phases or when explicitly reloading instance templates from the database.
