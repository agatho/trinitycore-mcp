  brief: Checks if the player is currently channeling any spell or ability.
  description: The IsChannelingAny method determines whether the player character
    is currently engaged in channeling a spell or ability. This includes abilities
    like Healing Stream Totem, Shadowfiend, or any other spell that requires sustained
    casting over time. The method returns true if the player has an active channeled
    spell, and false otherwise. It's commonly used in game logic to prevent certain
    actions while a character is channeling, such as moving or attacking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently channeling any spell or ability,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for active channeling
    code: "if (player->GetCooldownManager()->IsChannelingAny()) {\n    // Player cannot\
      \ perform certain actions\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot do that while\
      \ channeling.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks internal cooldown manager state to determine
    if any channeled spells are active. It's important to note that this check is
    usually performed on the player's cooldown manager instance, which is part of
    the player's game object.
