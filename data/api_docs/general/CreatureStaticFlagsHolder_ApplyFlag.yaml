  signature: void CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::ApplyFlag(CreatureStaticFlags8 flag,
    bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a static flag from a creature's flag set.
  description: The ApplyFlag method modifies the static flags of a CreatureStaticFlagsHolder
    instance by either setting or clearing a specific flag. This functionality is
    typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage creature behavior,
    AI states, and interaction properties at runtime. The method takes a CreatureStaticFlags8
    flag value and a boolean indicating whether to apply (set) or remove (clear) that
    flag from the holder's internal flag set. This operation directly affects how
    the creature behaves within the game world, such as enabling or disabling specific
    AI behaviors, movement patterns, or interaction states.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The CreatureStaticFlags8 flag to be applied or removed. This represents
      a specific static behavior or property flag for the creature.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the specified flag from the creature's flag set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Creature Immunity Flag
    code: 'CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flags;

      flags.ApplyFlag(CreatureStaticFlags8::ImmuneToPC, true);

      // The creature will now be immune to player attacks.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Creature Aggro Flag
    code: 'CreatureStaticFlagsHolder flags;

      flags.ApplyFlag(CreatureStaticFlags8::NoAggro, false);

      // The creature will no longer ignore player aggro.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the internal flag state of a creature. It
    is commonly used in AI scripts and game logic to dynamically change creature behavior
    without requiring a full object recreation. The method assumes that the CreatureStaticFlags8
    enum values are properly defined and correspond to valid static flags within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected creature behavior or
    game state inconsistencies. Ensure that flag values are valid for the specific
    creature type and that applying/removing flags doesn't conflict with other systems.
    This method should not be called during critical sections where flag consistency
    is required.
