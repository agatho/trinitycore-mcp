  method: LoadBugTickets
  signature: void SupportMgr::LoadBugTickets()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all bug tickets from the database into memory for processing and display
    within the support system.
  description: The LoadBugTickets method initializes the internal data structures
    of the SupportMgr class by retrieving all existing bug reports from the database.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when the support manager
    needs to refresh its ticket cache. It populates the in-memory collection of bug
    tickets, enabling other methods within the class to access and manipulate these
    reports. The method ensures that all relevant data associated with each bug ticket
    is correctly loaded, including ticket ID, submitter information, status, priority,
    and detailed descriptions. This process is essential for maintaining an up-to-date
    view of user-reported issues within the game's support infrastructure.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'SupportMgr* supportMgr = new SupportMgr();

      supportMgr->LoadBugTickets();

      // Bug tickets are now loaded and accessible'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query that may impact performance during
    server startup. It is recommended to call this method asynchronously or during
    low-traffic periods to avoid blocking the main thread. The method assumes that
    the database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling LoadBugTickets multiple times without clearing previous data may
    result in duplicate entries in the internal ticket collection. Ensure proper synchronization
    if this method is called from multiple threads.
