documentation:
  brief: Logs a formatted message to the exception report
  description: The Log method in WheatyExceptionReport is used to record formatted
    diagnostic information into an exception report. This method typically handles
    string formatting and writes the resulting message to an output stream or log
    file, often used for debugging purposes in TrinityCore server environments. The
    method accepts a format string that follows standard printf-style formatting conventions.
    It's commonly invoked when capturing crash information or tracking runtime errors
    within the World of Warcraft server infrastructure.
  parameters:
  - name: format
    description: A pointer to a null-terminated wide character string containing the
      format specification for the message to be logged. This follows standard printf-style
      formatting conventions where format specifiers like %s, %d, %f are used to insert
      values into the output.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the logging
    operation. Typically, a return value of 0 indicates successful completion, while
    non-zero values may indicate errors such as insufficient buffer space or write
    failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Logging Example
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport report;

      report.Log(L"Player %s entered zone %d at position (%f, %f)", playerName, zoneId,
      x, y);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Reporting with Log
    code: "WheatyExceptionReport report;\nint result = report.Log(L\"Database connection\
      \ failed with error code: %d\", errorCode);\nif (result != 0) {\n    // Handle\
      \ logging failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause race conditions
    when used in multi-threaded server environments. It's recommended to use wide
    character strings (TCHAR) for compatibility with both Unicode and ANSI builds
    of TrinityCore. The actual output destination may vary based on configuration
    settings but typically includes console output, log files, or debug streams.
  warnings: Ensure that the format string passed to this method is properly validated
    to prevent buffer overflows or injection attacks. The method does not perform
    automatic memory management for the format string; developers must ensure proper
    lifetime management of string parameters.
