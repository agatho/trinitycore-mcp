  class: Item
  method: SetPetitionNumSignatures
  signature: void Item::SetPetitionNumSignatures(uint32 signatures)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of signatures required for a petition item.
  description: This method configures the petition item to require a specific number
    of signatures before it can be submitted for validation. The signature count determines
    how many players must sign the petition for it to be considered valid. This is
    typically used in conjunction with other petition-related methods to manage the
    state and requirements of a player's petition.
  parameters:
  - name: signature
    description: The number of signatures required for the petition item to be valid.
      This value must be between 1 and 10, representing the minimum number of signatures
      needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting petition signature count
    code: 'Item* petition = new Item();

      petition->SetPetitionNumSignatures(5);

      // This sets the petition to require 5 signatures'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the broader petition system in World of Warcraft and
    interacts with other methods like GetPetitionNumSignatures. The implementation
    likely involves updating internal data structures that track the petition's signature
    requirements.
  warnings: Care should be taken when setting this value, as incorrect values may
    result in a petition being invalid or unable to be submitted. Ensure that the
    signature count aligns with game mechanics and player expectations.
