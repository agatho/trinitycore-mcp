  signature: void LootCoordination::HandleCorruptedLootState(uint32 sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles the state of corrupted loot for a specific session
    ID in the loot coordination system.
  description: The HandleCorruptedLootState method is responsible for managing the
    state of corrupted loot items within the TrinityCore loot coordination framework.
    This function takes a session identifier as input and performs necessary operations
    to update or synchronize the corrupted loot status for that particular player
    session. It likely interacts with internal loot tracking mechanisms to ensure
    proper handling of items that have been marked as corrupted, which may affect
    how they are distributed or processed during loot events. The method is part of
    the general loot coordination system and is typically invoked when a player's
    loot state needs to be updated based on corruption status.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the player session that owns the corrupted
      loot items. This value is used to locate and process the specific loot state
      associated with this session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LootCoordination lootCoord;

      uint32 playerSessionId = 12345;

      lootCoord.HandleCorruptedLootState(playerSessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the loot coordination system when
    corruption status changes occur. Developers should ensure that session IDs are
    valid before calling this function to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Improper handling of session IDs may lead to incorrect loot state updates
    or memory access violations. This method should only be invoked with valid session
    identifiers from active player sessions.
