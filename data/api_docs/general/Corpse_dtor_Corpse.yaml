  class: Corpse
  method: ~Corpse
  signature: void Corpse::~Corpse()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Corpse object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Corpse destructor is automatically invoked when a Corpse object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of memory and resources allocated for the corpse, including removing it from the
    game world, cleaning up any references to player data, and notifying relevant
    systems that the corpse is no longer valid. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, corpses are temporary objects representing the remains of players
    who have died, and their destruction is crucial for maintaining game state consistency
    and preventing memory leaks.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of a Corpse object
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();\n    // ...\
      \ some operations with the corpse ...\n    delete corpse; // This triggers ~Corpse()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Scope-based destruction of a Corpse object
    code: "void AnotherExample()\n{\n    {\n        Corpse corpse;\n        // ...\
      \ use corpse ...\n    } // ~Corpse() is automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs critical cleanup operations such as removing the
    corpse from the world object manager, clearing any references to the player who
    died, and ensuring that the corpse's GUID is properly invalidated. It is important
    not to manually call this destructor unless you are certain about the object's
    lifecycle management.
  warnings: Never explicitly call the destructor on a Corpse object unless you're
    managing memory manually and understand the implications. The destructor should
    only be invoked as part of normal object destruction flow, either through stack
    scope exit or explicit delete operations.
