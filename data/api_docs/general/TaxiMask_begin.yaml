documentation:
  brief: Initializes the taxi mask for tracking visited taxi nodes.
  description: The TaxiMask::begin method initializes the internal state of the taxi
    mask, typically resetting or preparing it for use in tracking which taxi nodes
    have been visited by a player. This method is commonly called during player login
    or when starting a new taxi journey to ensure the mask is in a valid initial state.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations, serving
    purely as an initialization routine.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Taxi Mask on Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    m_taxiMask.begin();\n    // Proceed with\
      \ other login operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any taxi node tracking operations to
    ensure proper initialization of the internal mask state. It is typically invoked
    automatically by the core during player session setup.
