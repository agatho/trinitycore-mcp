  method: EstimateDPS
  signature: uint32 PvPCombatAI::EstimateDPS(int * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Estimates the damage per second (DPS) that a player can deal in PvP combat.
  description: The EstimateDPS method calculates and returns an estimated damage per
    second value for a player's current combat state in PvP environments. This estimation
    takes into account various factors such as weapon damage, attack speed, player
    level, and equipped gear. The method is typically used by AI systems to determine
    optimal combat strategies or to evaluate the threat level of opponents. It provides
    a dynamic estimate that reflects the current state of the player's abilities and
    equipment rather than a static baseline value.
  parameters:
  - name: unit
    description: Pointer to the target unit for which DPS estimation is performed.
      This parameter may be used internally by the AI system to determine combat context,
      though its exact usage depends on implementation details of the PvPCombatAI
      class.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the estimated damage per second (DPS)
    that the player can deal in PvP combat. Higher values indicate more potent attackers,
    while lower values suggest weaker combatants or defensive positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic DPS Estimation Usage
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = new PvPCombatAI();\nUnit* target = player->GetVictim();\n\
      uint32 estimatedDPS = ai->EstimateDPS(&target);\n// Use estimatedDPS to determine\
      \ combat strategy\nif (estimatedDPS > 1000)\n{\n    // Consider using defensive\
      \ abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using DPS for Threat Assessment
    code: "void EvaluateCombatThreat(Player* player)\n{\n    PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\n\
      \    Unit* currentTarget = player->GetVictim();\n    uint32 myDPS = ai->EstimateDPS(&currentTarget);\n\
      \    \n    if (myDPS > 1500)\n        player->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY,\
      \ LANG_UNIVERSAL, \"I'm dealing high damage!\");\n    else\n        player->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY,\
      \ LANG_UNIVERSAL, \"Time to switch tactics.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may perform calculations based on current weapon statistics, enchantments,
    buffs, and debuffs. It's important to note that this is an estimation and not
    a precise measurement of actual damage dealt during combat. The result can vary
    depending on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's AI framework.
  warnings: This function should only be called when the player is in PvP combat or
    has a valid target. Calling it outside of combat conditions may lead to inaccurate
    estimations or undefined behavior due to missing context information. Additionally,
    the returned value does not account for critical strikes or special abilities
    that might significantly alter real-world damage output.
