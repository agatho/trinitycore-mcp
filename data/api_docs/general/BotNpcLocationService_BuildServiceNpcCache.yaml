  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: BuildServiceNpcCache
  signature: void BotNpcLocationService::BuildServiceNpcCache()
documentation:
  brief: Populates the internal cache with NPC locations for bot service functionality.
  description: The BuildServiceNpcCache method initializes and fills an internal data
    structure with the locations of NPCs that provide services to bots. This caching
    mechanism ensures efficient lookup of service locations without repeatedly querying
    the database or world state. The method typically runs during server initialization
    or when bot-related systems are first accessed, ensuring that all necessary NPC
    positions are readily available for pathfinding and interaction logic. It is designed
    to be called once per session or when the cache needs refreshing due to dynamic
    changes in NPC positions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotNpcLocationService service;

      service.BuildServiceNpcCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the world state and NPC data have
    been fully loaded. It is not thread-safe and should be executed on the main thread
    or within a synchronized context to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without clearing the cache may result
    in duplicate entries or inconsistent data. Ensure that any existing cache is cleared
    before rebuilding if needed.
