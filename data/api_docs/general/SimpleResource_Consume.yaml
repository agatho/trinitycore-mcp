  class: SimpleResource
  method: Consume
  signature: uint32 SimpleResource::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of resource and returns the actual amount consumed.
  description: The Consume method reduces the internal resource count by the specified
    amount, but will not consume more than what is currently available. It ensures
    that the resource consumption is bounded by the current resource level. This method
    is typically used in game mechanics where resources such as mana, energy, or health
    are depleted when performing actions like casting spells or using abilities. The
    method returns the actual amount of resource consumed, which may be less than
    requested if insufficient resources are available.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the actual amount of resource that was consumed. If the requested
    amount exceeds the available resource, it returns the remaining resource amount.
    If no resource is available, it returns zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: 'SimpleResource resource(100);

      uint32 consumed = resource.Consume(30);

      // consumed = 30, resource now has 70 remaining'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming More Than Available
    code: 'SimpleResource resource(50);

      uint32 consumed = resource.Consume(75);

      // consumed = 50, resource now has 0 remaining'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe in the context of TrinityCore's
    architecture. It should not be used concurrently with other methods that modify
    the resource without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency operations as it
    may lead to performance bottlenecks if not properly managed. Also, ensure that
    the resource level is always checked before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
