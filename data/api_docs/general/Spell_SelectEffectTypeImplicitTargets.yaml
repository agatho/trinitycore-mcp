  brief: Sets implicit target types for spell effects based on provided SpellEffectInfo
    data.
  description: This method determines and assigns the appropriate implicit target
    types for spell effects within a spell, using the SpellEffectInfo structure to
    define the target type parameters. It is used during spell initialization and
    processing to ensure correct targeting behavior for various spell mechanics. The
    method handles different target types such as targets for area of effect spells,
    single target spells, or other specific targeting requirements based on the effect's
    properties.

      // This method is typically called during spell initialization or processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell handling mechanism and should not
    be directly invoked by external code. It's primarily used in conjunction with
    other spell-related methods during spell creation and execution.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect targeting behavior,
    causing spells to target wrong objects or fail to apply correctly. This method
    should only be called when the SpellEffectInfo is properly initialized.
