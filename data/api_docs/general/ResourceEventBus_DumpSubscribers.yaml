documentation:
  brief: Dumps all registered subscribers from the resource event bus to the console
    or log output.
  description: The DumpSubscribers method is a debugging utility that iterates through
    all currently registered subscribers in the ResourceEventBus and outputs their
    details to the system log or console. This method is typically used during development
    or troubleshooting to inspect which components or systems are listening for resource-related
    events. It does not modify any state within the event bus and serves purely for
    diagnostic purposes. The output includes information about each subscriber, such
    as their type, identifier, and registration status. This method is usually disabled
    in production builds unless explicitly enabled for debugging.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'ResourceEventBus::Instance().DumpSubscribers();

      // Outputs all registered subscribers to the log for inspection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for development and debugging only. It may have performance
    implications if called frequently in a production environment due to the overhead
    of iterating through all subscribers and logging their details. The output format
    depends on the underlying logging system used by TrinityCore.
  warnings: Do not call this method in high-frequency loops or performance-critical
    sections of code, as it can significantly impact performance. Also, ensure that
    debug logging is enabled in your build configuration to see the output.
