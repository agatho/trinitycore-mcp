  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteAcceptQuest
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteAcceptQuest(Player * bot,
    const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts a quest for the specified bot player.
  description: The ExecuteAcceptQuest method processes a quest acceptance action for
    a given bot player. It handles the logic required to accept a quest from a quest
    giver NPC, including validating the quest requirements, updating the player's
    quest log, and managing any associated quest rewards or objectives. This method
    is typically invoked as part of the bot's AI decision-making process when it determines
    that accepting a specific quest would be beneficial for the bot's progression
    or task completion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will accept
      the quest.
  - name: action
    description: The BotAction structure containing details about the quest acceptance
      action, such as the quest ID and target NPC.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult enum value indicating whether the quest acceptance
    was successful, failed, or encountered an error. Possible values may include SUCCESS,
    FAILURE, or INVALID_ACTION depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_ACCEPT_QUEST;\naction.questId\
      \ = 12345;\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteAcceptQuest(bot, action);\n\
      if (result == BOT_RESULT_SUCCESS) {\n    // Quest accepted successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has already identified a valid quest to
    accept and that all preconditions for quest acceptance have been met. The implementation
    may involve checking quest availability, player level requirements, previous quest
    completion status, and other game-specific constraints.
  warnings: Ensure that the action parameter contains valid quest data before calling
    this method, as invalid quest IDs or missing NPC references can lead to undefined
    behavior or failed quest acceptance attempts.
