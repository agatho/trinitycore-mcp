documentation:
  brief: Moves items between inventory slots within a guild's bank or from player
    to guild bank.
  description: The _MoveItems method handles the internal logic for moving items between
    different storage locations within a guild, such as transferring items from a
    player's inventory to the guild bank or vice versa. This method is typically invoked
    when a guild member performs an item transfer action, and it manages the necessary
    updates to item counts, stacks, and slot references. It ensures that item movement
    respects game rules like stack limits, item restrictions, and proper inventory
    state management. The method operates on MoveItemData structures which contain
    source and destination information for the items being moved.
  parameters:
  - name: pSrc
    description: Pointer to the source MoveItemData structure containing information
      about where items are being moved from.
  - name: pDest
    description: Pointer to the destination MoveItemData structure containing information
      about where items are being moved to.
  - name: splitedAmount
    description: The number of items to move, used when splitting stacks during movement
      operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving items from player inventory to guild bank
    code: 'MoveItemData src;

      MoveItemData dest;

      src.player = player;

      src.container = player->GetContainer(0);

      src.slot = 5;

      dest.guild = guild;

      dest.container = guild->GetBankContainer();

      dest.slot = 10;

      guild->_MoveItems(&src, &dest, 2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function and should not be called directly
    by external code. It assumes valid MoveItemData structures are provided and performs
    no validation on input parameters.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method without proper setup of MoveItemData structures
    can lead to undefined behavior or data corruption in the guild's inventory system.
