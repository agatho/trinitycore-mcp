  brief: Handles immediate phase execution for spell effects in World of Warcraft

  description: This method processes the immediate phase of spell handling, which
    occurs when a spell is cast and its effects are applied instantly without any
    delay or channeling. It typically manages the direct application of spell effects
    to targets, including damage calculations, healing, and status effects. The method
    ensures that all immediate effects are properly executed according to game mechanics
    rules, including handling of critical hits, miss chances, and target selection.
    This function is crucial for maintaining proper spell execution flow during combat
    situations.

  - title: Basic Spell Immediate Phase Handling
    code: "void Spell::_handle_immediate_phase()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n\
      \    // Execute immediate effects\n    // Apply damage or healing\n    // Handle\
      \ critical hits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during spell cast execution when the spell is
    in immediate phase. It typically handles direct application of effects without
    any channeling time. Implementation requires careful handling of target selection
    and effect application order.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect spell effects being
    applied, potentially causing game balance issues or client-side errors. This method
    should not be called during channeling phases.
