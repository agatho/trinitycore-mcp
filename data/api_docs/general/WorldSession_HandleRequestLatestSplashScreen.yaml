documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to retrieve the latest splash screen data for display.
  description: This method processes a client-side request to obtain the most recent
    splash screen information, typically used during game startup or when the player
    needs to view updated promotional content. The method likely retrieves and sends
    back the appropriate splash screen packet to the connected client. It is part
    of the general session handling mechanisms in TrinityCore's WorldSession class,
    which manages communication between the server and connected players. This functionality
    supports dynamic content delivery for in-game promotional events or updates.
  parameters:
  - name: requestLatestSplashScreen
    description: A packet object containing the client's request for the latest splash
      screen data. The packet structure typically includes metadata about the request
      such as version information or flags indicating what type of splash screen is
      being requested.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in WorldSession Context

      \ requestLatestSplashScreen)\n{\n    // Retrieve latest splash screen data from\
      \ database or cache\n    // Send appropriate packet back to client\n    WorldPacket\
      \ data(SMSG_LATEST_SPLASH_SCREEN);\n    data << uint32(12345); // Example splash\
      \ screen ID\n    SendPacket(data);\n}"

  notes: This method is likely invoked during client initialization or when the player
    enters the game world. It may be related to handling version-specific splash screens
    or promotional content updates that require server-side validation before delivery.
