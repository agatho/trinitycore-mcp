documentation:
  brief: Checks if the auction event is valid and properly initialized
  description: The IsValid method performs a validation check on the AuctionEvent
    object to determine whether it has been correctly initialized and contains valid
    data. This method typically verifies that required fields are populated, internal
    state is consistent, and the auction event can safely be used in game operations.
    The validation may include checking for null pointers, valid GUIDs, proper time
    ranges, and other structural integrity requirements. This method is commonly used
    before performing operations on auction events to prevent runtime errors or undefined
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the auction event is valid and properly initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the object is in an
    invalid state due to incomplete initialization, corrupted data, or missing required
    information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "AuctionEvent* event = sAuctionMgr->GetAuction(12345);\nif (event && event->IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Safe to use the auction event\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"auction\", \"Valid\
      \ auction event found: {}\", event->GetId());\n} else {\n    LOG_WARNING(\"\
      auction\", \"Invalid or missing auction event\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in auction processing
    code: "void ProcessAuctionBid(uint32 auctionId, Player* bidder) {\n    AuctionEvent*\
      \ auction = sAuctionMgr->GetAuction(auctionId);\n    if (!auction || !auction->IsValid())\
      \ {\n        SendAuctionError(bidder, AUCTION_ERR_INVALID);\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // Proceed with bid processing\n    HandleValidBid(auction, bidder);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a lightweight check that doesn't
    perform heavy computations. It's designed to be called frequently during auction
    operations to quickly validate object state without significant performance impact.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid AuctionEvent will remain valid throughout its
    lifetime. Auction events can become invalid due to external factors like auction
    timeouts, item removal, or server state changes. Always revalidate before critical
    operations.
