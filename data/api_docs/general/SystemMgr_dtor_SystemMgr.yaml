  signature: void SystemMgr::~SystemMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SystemMgr instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The ~SystemMgr destructor is called automatically when a SystemMgr
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of system resources, including releasing memory allocated for internal
    data structures and performing any required shutdown procedures. In the context
    of TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor may handle cleanup of system-wide
    managers that manage various subsystems such as configuration settings, database
    connections, or global game state variables. The destructor is typically invoked
    by the C++ runtime during object destruction and should not be called manually
    unless explicitly needed for custom memory management.

  - title: Automatic Destructor Call
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    SystemMgr* mgr = new SystemMgr();\n    //\
      \ ... use mgr ...\n    delete mgr; // ~SystemMgr() is automatically called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
    pattern used throughout TrinityCore. It ensures that system resources are properly
    released when objects are destroyed, preventing memory leaks and other resource-related
    issues. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom object lifecycle management.
