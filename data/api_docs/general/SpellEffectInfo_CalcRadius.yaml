    Spell * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the radius of a spell effect based on caster, target index, and
    spell data.
  description: The CalcRadius method computes the effective radius of a spell effect
    for a given caster, target index, and spell instance. This calculation takes into
    account various factors such as spell effect parameters, caster's attributes,
    and target-specific modifiers. The returned float value represents the radius
    in yards that defines the area of effect for the spell. This method is crucial
    for determining how far a spell's influence extends, particularly for area-of-effect
    spells like fireballs or healing circles. It ensures proper game balance by dynamically
    calculating radius values based on contextual factors rather than static values.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. This can be
      a player, creature, or any game entity capable of casting spells. Must not be
      null for valid calculations.
  - name: targetIndex
    description: Integer index representing which target the radius calculation is
      being performed for. Used to differentiate between multiple targets in multi-target
      spells. Typically ranges from 0 to number of targets - 1.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell instance that contains the spell data and configuration.
      Required for accessing spell effect parameters and other relevant spell properties
      during radius calculation.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated radius in yards. This value determines
    the spatial extent of the spell effect area. Returns 0.0f if calculation fails
    or parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating spell effect radius
    code: "float radius = spellEffect->CalcRadius(caster, 0, spell);\nif (radius >\
      \ 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use calculated radius for area effect logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      spell\", \"Spell effect radius: {} yards\", radius);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using radius in area-of-effect spell handling
    code: "void HandleAreaEffectSpell(Spell* spell)\n{\n    WorldObject* caster =\
      \ spell->GetCaster();\n    if (!caster) return;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < spell->GetTargetsCount();\
      \ ++i)\n    {\n        float radius = spell->GetSpellInfo()->GetEffect(0)->CalcRadius(caster,\
      \ i, spell);\n        // Apply effects within calculated radius\n        ApplyAreaEffects(caster,\
      \ radius);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution when determining the
    actual area of effect. The calculation may involve interpolation between base
    and maximum values based on caster's level or spell power. It's important to note
    that this function might be called multiple times per spell depending on the number
    of targets affected. The radius calculation can vary based on spell modifiers,
    talents, and other game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters (caster, targetIndex, spell) are valid
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned radius value
    should be validated before use in spatial calculations to prevent potential issues
    with zero or negative values.
