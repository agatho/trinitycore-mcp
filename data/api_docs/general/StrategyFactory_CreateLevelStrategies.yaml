documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes AI strategies for a player based on their level
  description: The CreateLevelStrategies method generates appropriate AI behavior
    strategies for a player character according to their current level. This method
    is typically invoked during player initialization or level-up events to ensure
    the AI system has the correct strategy set for the player's progression stage.
    The method likely populates internal strategy containers with level-appropriate
    behaviors, such as quest prioritization, combat tactics, and resource management.
    It may also handle strategy validation and error checking to ensure all strategies
    are properly configured before being applied to the player's AI context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of strategy
    creation. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while
    negative values may represent various error conditions such as invalid level parameters
    or allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for player level 15
    code: "StrategyFactory factory;\nint result = factory.CreateLevelStrategies(15);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Strategies created successfully\n    printf(\"AI\
      \ strategies for level 15 initialized\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to create AI strategies: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that dynamically adjusts
    player behavior based on game progression. The implementation may cache strategy
    configurations for performance optimization and could be called multiple times
    during a player's session as levels change.
  warnings: The method assumes valid level parameters and may not handle edge cases
    gracefully. Calling this method with invalid level values (e.g., outside expected
    range) could result in undefined behavior or error codes. Ensure proper validation
    of input parameters before invocation.
