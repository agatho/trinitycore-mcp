  method: NormalizeAngle
  signature: float PositionUtils::NormalizeAngle(float angle)
documentation:
  brief: Normalizes an angle to the range [0, 2*PI) radians.
  description: "The NormalizeAngle method takes an angle in radians and normalizes\
    \ it to fall within the standard range of [0, 2*PI). This is commonly used in\
    \ game mechanics for handling directional data such as facing angles, movement\
    \ directions, or rotation values. The method ensures that any input angle, regardless\
    \ of how many full rotations it contains, will be converted into a normalized\
    \ value between 0 and 2\u03C0 radians. This normalization is essential for consistent\
    \ gameplay behavior and accurate calculations involving trigonometric functions\
    \ or angular comparisons."
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the normalized angle in radians, constrained
    to the range [0, 2*PI).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Angle Normalization
    code: "float angle = 5.0f * M_PI; // 5\u03C0 radians\nfloat normalized = PositionUtils::NormalizeAngle(angle);\n\
      // Result: normalized \u2248 1.5708 radians (\u03C0/2)"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Negative Angles
    code: "float angle = -M_PI_2; // -\u03C0/2 radians\nfloat normalized = PositionUtils::NormalizeAngle(angle);\n\
      // Result: normalized \u2248 4.7124 radians (3\u03C0/2)"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented using modulo arithmetic to wrap angles
    into the desired range. It's commonly used in pathfinding, AI movement logic,
    and orientation calculations within TrinityCore's game engine.
