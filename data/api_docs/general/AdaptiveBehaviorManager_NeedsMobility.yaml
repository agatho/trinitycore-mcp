  method: NeedsMobility
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::NeedsMobility() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager requires mobility adjustments
    for the current AI state.
  description: The NeedsMobility method evaluates the current state of the adaptive
    behavior manager to determine if mobility-related adjustments are necessary. This
    typically involves checking conditions such as movement restrictions, environmental
    factors, or AI decision states that would affect how a creature should move or
    behave. The method is used internally by the AI system to dynamically adjust movement
    patterns based on real-time game conditions and player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if mobility adjustments are required for the current AI state;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.NeedsMobility()) {\n    // Apply mobility adjustments\n\
      \    creature->SetSpeed(MOVE_RUN, 2.5f);\n    creature->MoveTowardsPlayer();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.NeedsMobility())\
      \ {\n        if (!creature->IsInCombat()) {\n            creature->SetWalk(true);\n\
      \        }\n        // Additional mobility logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and should be efficient
    as it may be invoked frequently. The decision-making process likely involves checking
    internal flags or state variables related to the creature's current behavior mode.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for critical path logic without understanding
    its underlying conditions, as the mobility requirements can change rapidly based
    on game state and player actions.
