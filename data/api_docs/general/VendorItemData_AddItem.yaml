documentation:
  brief: Adds a vendor item to the vendor's inventory list
  description: The AddItem method inserts a VendorItem object into the internal list
    of items that a vendor can sell. This method is typically used during the initialization
    or modification of a vendor's inventory in the game world. The added item will
    be available for players to purchase when they interact with the vendor. This
    operation modifies the vendor's item list in-place and does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: vItem
    description: The VendorItem object containing the item details to be added to
      the vendor's inventory. This includes item entry ID, max count, increment time,
      and other relevant vendor-specific properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'VendorItem item;

      item.item = 12345; // Item entry ID

      item.maxcount = 10;

      item.incrtime = 3600;

      vendorData.AddItem(item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Items
    code: 'VendorItem item1, item2;

      item1.item = 12345;

      item1.maxcount = 5;

      item1.incrtime = 1800;


      item2.item = 67890;

      item2.maxcount = 1;

      item2.incrtime = 7200;


      vendorData.AddItem(item1);

      vendorData.AddItem(item2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal data structure of the VendorItemData
    object. It is recommended to call this method before the vendor becomes active
    in the game world to avoid potential synchronization issues. The method does not
    perform any validation on the input item, so invalid entries may lead to unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Adding items with duplicate entry IDs might cause undefined behavior or
    override existing entries. Ensure that each VendorItem added has a unique item
    ID unless intentional overwriting is desired. This method should not be called
    during active vendor transactions as it may affect the current state of the vendor's
    inventory.
