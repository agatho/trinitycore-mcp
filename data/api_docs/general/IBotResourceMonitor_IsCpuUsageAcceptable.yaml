  method: IsCpuUsageAcceptable
  signature: bool IBotResourceMonitor::IsCpuUsageAcceptable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether current CPU usage is within acceptable limits for bot
    operation.
  description: The IsCpuUsageAcceptable method evaluates the current system CPU utilization
    and compares it against predefined thresholds to determine if the system can sustain
    bot operations without performance degradation. This method is typically used
    by bot management systems to make decisions about spawning, running, or pausing
    bot activities based on available system resources. The check considers both overall
    CPU load and potential impact on server performance. It's designed to prevent
    excessive resource consumption that could affect the stability or responsiveness
    of the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if current CPU usage is below the maximum acceptable threshold,
    allowing bot operations to proceed normally; returns false if CPU usage exceeds
    acceptable limits, indicating that bot activities should be limited or paused
    to maintain system stability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botMonitor->IsCpuUsageAcceptable()) {\n    // Proceed with normal bot\
      \ operations\n    bot->StartAI();\n} else {\n    // Pause or limit bot activities\n\
      \    bot->PauseAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Resource Management Loop
    code: "void ResourceManager::UpdateBotStatus() {\n    if (resourceMonitor->IsCpuUsageAcceptable())\
      \ {\n        for (auto& bot : activeBots) {\n            if (bot->IsPaused())\
      \ {\n                bot->Resume();\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n\
      \        for (auto& bot : activeBots) {\n            if (!bot->IsPaused()) {\n\
      \                bot->Pause();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lightweight CPU load measurement without significant
    overhead. It's intended to be called frequently in resource management loops.
    The actual threshold values may be configurable through server settings or bot
    configuration files. Implementation may use platform-specific APIs for CPU monitoring.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops as it might introduce
    unnecessary overhead. The method should not be used as the sole criterion for
    critical system decisions; consider combining with memory usage checks and other
    resource metrics for comprehensive resource management.
