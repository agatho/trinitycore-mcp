  class: EconomyManager
  method: RecordItemCrafted
  signature: void EconomyManager::RecordItemCrafted(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the crafting of a specific item in the economy system for tracking
    and analytics purposes.
  description: The RecordItemCrafted method logs the creation of a crafted item within
    the TrinityCore economy manager. This function is typically invoked when a player
    successfully crafts an item using a profession skill, allowing the server to track
    crafting activity, maintain statistics, and potentially trigger economy-related
    events or achievements. The method stores the item identifier in internal tracking
    structures without returning any value. It assumes that the item ID provided is
    valid and corresponds to a crafted item within the game's database.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the crafted item being recorded. This must
      correspond to a valid item entry in the game's database, typically obtained
      from the item template or crafting system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sEconomyManager;

      economyMgr->RecordItemCrafted(12345); // Records the crafting of item with ID
      12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Crafting System
    code: "void Player::OnCraftItem(uint32 itemId)\n{\n    // Perform crafting logic\
      \ here\n    \n    // Record the crafted item in economy tracking\n    sEconomyManager->RecordItemCrafted(itemId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or logs for economy analysis.
    It should be called after successful crafting completion to ensure accurate tracking.
    The implementation may involve database writes or in-memory data structures depending
    on the economy system's design.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId parameter is validated before calling this method,
    as invalid item IDs could lead to incorrect tracking or potential errors in the
    economy system. This method does not perform any validation of the item itself,
    so it's the caller's responsibility to ensure correctness.
