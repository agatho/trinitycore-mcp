  class: AssistDelayEvent
  method: AddAssistant
  signature: void AssistDelayEvent::AddAssistant(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new assistant to the AssistDelayEvent with the specified GUID.
  description: The AddAssistant method is used to register a new assistant unit within
    an AssistDelayEvent. This mechanism is typically employed in AI systems where
    a creature or NPC needs to delay assistance to a target based on certain conditions
    or timing. The method accepts a unique identifier (GUID) representing the assistant
    unit and incorporates it into the event's internal tracking structure. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other assist-related methods to manage group behavior,
    threat distribution, or coordinated attacks in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the assistant unit to be added to
      the event. This value must represent a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AssistDelayEvent* event = new AssistDelayEvent();

      uint32 assistantGuid = 12345;

      event->AddAssistant(assistantGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Assistants
    code: "AssistDelayEvent* event = new AssistDelayEvent();\nuint32 assistants[]\
      \ = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    event->AddAssistant(assistants[i]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided GUID corresponds to an
    actual existing unit in the world. It simply stores the GUID for later use in
    the assist delay logic. The internal implementation likely uses a container such
    as std::set or std::vector to maintain the list of assistants.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and refers to an active
    unit in the game world, otherwise unexpected behavior may occur during event execution.
    This method should not be called with duplicate GUIDs unless intentional.
