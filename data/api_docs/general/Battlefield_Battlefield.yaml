  brief: Moves a Battlefield object to another Battlefield object using move semantics.
  description: The Battlefield::Battlefield constructor with move semantics transfers
    ownership of resources from one Battlefield instance to another. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where a Battlefield object needs to be efficiently
    transferred without copying its internal state. The move constructor ensures that
    the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the transfer.
    In the context of TrinityCore's battleground system, this would be relevant when
    managing battlefield instances during creation, destruction, or state transitions.

  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a Battlefield Object
    code: 'Battlefield&& source = std::move(someBattlefield);

      Battlefield newBattlefield(std::move(source));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, so it's designed for efficient resource transfer.
    After calling this constructor, the original object should not be used unless
    explicitly reset or reassigned. The implementation assumes that the source object
    is in a valid state for moving.
  warnings: Using the move constructor on an already moved-from object can lead to
    undefined behavior. Always ensure proper state management when using move semantics.
