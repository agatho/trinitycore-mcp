documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of creature quest involvement relations for a given
    quest ID
  description: This method returns the count of creature quest involvement relations
    associated with a specific quest ID. It is used internally by the TrinityCore
    server to manage quest-related creature data, particularly when processing quest
    completion or tracking quest progress involving creatures. The method likely accesses
    internal data structures that map quest IDs to their related creatures, which
    are essential for proper quest handling in World of Warcraft. This function does
    not modify any data but rather provides a read-only count of the relations.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of creature quest involvement relations
    found for the specified quest ID. Returns 0 if no relations exist or if the quest
    ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get creature quest relation count for a specific quest
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nint relationCount = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureQuestInvolvedRelationReverseBounds(questId);\n\
      if (relationCount > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Quest %u has %d creature involvement\
      \ relations\\n\", questId, relationCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No creature\
      \ involvement found for quest %u\\n\", questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during quest processing to determine how many
    creatures are involved in a specific quest. It may be called before iterating
    through related creatures to avoid unnecessary operations. The method likely uses
    internal lookup tables or caches for performance optimization.
  warnings: The method assumes that the quest ID passed is valid and exists in the
    database. If an invalid quest ID is provided, it will return 0 without error,
    which might mask issues in quest data integrity. Ensure proper validation of quest
    IDs before calling this method if strict error checking is required.
