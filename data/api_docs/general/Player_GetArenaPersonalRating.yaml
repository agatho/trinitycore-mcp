documentation:
  brief: Returns the personal arena rating for the specified slot.
  description: This method retrieves the personal arena rating value for a specific
    arena slot, which represents the player's ranking in that particular arena bracket.
    The method is used to access individual arena rating values for different arena
    types (2v2, 3v3, 5v5) and provides a way to check a player's competitive standing
    within each arena type. The returned value is typically used for calculating rewards,
    determining eligibility for arena team participation, and maintaining game balance
    in PvP systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the personal arena rating value for the specified slot, which represents
    the player's ranking in that particular arena bracket. The value is typically
    a uint32 representing the player's competitive standing within that specific arena
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 rating = player->GetArenaPersonalRating(0); // Get 2v2 personal rating
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "uint32 rating = player->GetArenaPersonalRating(1); // Get 3v3 personal\
      \ rating\nif (rating > 1000)\n{\n    // Player has high rating\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other arena-related methods
    to maintain proper PvP balance. The slot parameter represents the specific arena
    bracket type, and the returned value should be interpreted as a ranking indicator
    rather than a direct numerical value.
  warnings: This method should not be used for calculating rewards or determining
    eligibility without proper validation of the player's current rating values. The
    method may return 0 if the player has no rating in that specific arena bracket.
