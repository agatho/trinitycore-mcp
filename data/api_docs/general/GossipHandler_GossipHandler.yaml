  signature: void GossipHandler::GossipHandler()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the gossip handler for processing player interaction with NPCs.
  description: The GossipHandler constructor initializes the necessary components
    and state required to manage player-NPC dialogues within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method sets up internal data structures and registers callbacks needed for
    handling gossip menu interactions, including quest acceptances, vendor transactions,
    and other interactive dialogue options. The handler is typically invoked when
    a player selects an NPC with whom they wish to interact, triggering the display
    of available gossip options. It ensures proper context management for the current
    player session and prepares the system to process subsequent gossip selections.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GossipHandler Initialization
    code: 'GossipHandler handler;

      // The constructor automatically initializes internal state

      // for handling NPC dialogues and player interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core framework when a player
    initiates gossip with an NPC. Developers should not manually instantiate GossipHandler
    objects directly unless implementing custom interaction logic. The handler relies
    on proper session management and thread-safe access to player data structures.
  warnings: Improper use of this constructor outside of the expected framework context
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Never call this method directly in
    custom scripts without understanding the underlying session and state management
    requirements.
