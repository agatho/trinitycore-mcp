  class: GuildMgr
  method: SetNextGuildId
  signature: void GuildMgr::SetNextGuildId(int Id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the next available guild identifier for new guild creation in the game
    world.
  description: The SetNextGuildId method is used to configure the starting identifier
    that will be assigned to the next guild created within the TrinityCore server.
    This method allows administrators or internal systems to control the sequential
    assignment of guild IDs, which are essential for uniquely identifying guilds across
    the game world. It modifies an internal counter that tracks the next available
    ID, ensuring that subsequent guild creations receive sequential identifiers. The
    method does not validate the input ID but assumes it is a valid integer representing
    the desired next guild identifier.
  parameters:
  - name: Id
    description: The integer value to set as the next guild identifier. This should
      be a positive integer that represents the starting point for future guild ID
      assignments.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Next Guild ID to 1000
    code: GuildMgr::instance()->SetNextGuildId(1000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Reserving IDs for Future Use
    code: 'GuildMgr::instance()->SetNextGuildId(50000);

      // All new guilds created after this point will receive IDs starting from 50000'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies a global state variable within GuildMgr. It
    should be used carefully, especially in multi-threaded environments where concurrent
    access to guild creation might occur. The change affects all subsequent guild
    creations until overridden again.
  warnings: Setting this value incorrectly can lead to duplicate or invalid guild
    IDs if not handled properly. Ensure that the ID is greater than any existing guild
    ID to avoid conflicts.
