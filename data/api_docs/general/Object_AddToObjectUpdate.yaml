  signature: bool Object::AddToObjectUpdate()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the object to the update list for processing.
  description: The AddToObjectUpdate method is responsible for adding an Object instance
    to the update list, which is essential for managing object updates in the World
    of Warcraft server environment. This method ensures that the object will be processed
    during the next update cycle, allowing for proper synchronization of object states
    with client players. The method typically involves setting internal flags or state
    variables that indicate the object should be included in the update process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the object was successfully added to the update list, false
    otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the object is already in
    the update list or that the operation failed due to internal state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Object* obj = new Object();\nbool result = obj->AddToObjectUpdate();\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Object successfully added to update list\n    // Continue\
      \ with other operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server during object initialization
    or when objects need to be marked for updates. Performance considerations include
    avoiding frequent calls to this method, as it may cause unnecessary overhead in
    update processing. Thread safety is generally not an issue since this method is
    usually called from within a single-threaded context.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by developers unless explicitly
    required by the game mechanics or server architecture. Calling this method too
    frequently can lead to performance degradation and unnecessary processing overhead.
