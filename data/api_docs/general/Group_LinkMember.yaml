  method: LinkMember
  signature: void Group::LinkMember(GroupReference * pRef)
documentation:
  brief: Links a group member reference to the group, establishing a relationship
    between the group and its member.
  description: The LinkMember method is used to associate a GroupReference object
    with a Group instance. This method typically serves as an internal mechanism for
    maintaining the integrity of group membership within TrinityCore's framework.
    It ensures that when a player joins a group, their reference is properly linked
    to the group structure, allowing for proper management of group members, synchronization
    of group data, and coordination of group-based game mechanics such as loot distribution,
    experience sharing, and quest progression. The method likely updates internal
    data structures to track member relationships and may trigger necessary notifications
    or updates to other systems that depend on group membership information.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Member Linking
    code: 'Group* group = new Group();

      GroupReference* ref = new GroupReference();

      group->LinkMember(ref);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    players join groups. Developers should not normally need to call this method directly
    unless implementing custom group management logic or extending core group functionality.
    The method likely performs internal bookkeeping operations and may involve synchronization
    mechanisms.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method outside of core framework code is discouraged
    and may lead to inconsistent group state or memory management issues. Improper
    linking can cause crashes or undefined behavior in group-related systems.
