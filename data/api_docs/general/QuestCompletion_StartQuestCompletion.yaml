  class: QuestCompletion
  method: StartQuestCompletion
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::StartQuestCompletion(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the quest completion process for a specified quest ID and player.
  description: The StartQuestCompletion method begins the process of completing a
    quest for a given player. It validates whether the quest can be started or completed
    based on the player's current state, quest requirements, and game logic. This
    method typically checks if the player has met all prerequisites such as required
    items, quest objectives, or previous quest completions before proceeding with
    the quest completion. The method returns true upon successful initiation of the
    quest completion sequence, otherwise false if any validation fails.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest to be completed. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is attempting
      to complete the quest. Must not be null and must represent an active player
      instance.
  returns: Returns true if the quest completion process was successfully initiated
    for the specified player and quest, false otherwise. A return value of false may
    indicate that the player does not meet prerequisites, the quest is invalid, or
    other conditions prevent starting the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion Initiation
    code: "if (questCompletion->StartQuestCompletion(12345, player)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ completion process started successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest 12345\
      \ started for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to start quest completion\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to start quest 12345\
      \ for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of automated questing systems
    or AI bots. It assumes that the provided quest ID exists in the database and that
    the player object is valid and active. The actual completion of the quest may
    involve additional steps beyond this initial call.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to a valid quest in the
    game's database; otherwise, the method will likely return false without performing
    any meaningful action. Also, be cautious when calling this method on bots or players
    who are not in a valid state (e.g., not logged in or in combat), as it may lead
    to unexpected behavior.
