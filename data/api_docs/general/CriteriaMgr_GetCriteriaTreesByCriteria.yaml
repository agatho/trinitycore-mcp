  method: GetCriteriaTreesByCriteria
  signature: const CriteriaTreeList * CriteriaMgr::GetCriteriaTreesByCriteria(uint32
    criteriaId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of criteria trees associated with the specified criteria
    identifier.
  description: The GetCriteriaTreesByCriteria method fetches all criteria trees that
    are linked to a given criteria ID. This is used in the context of achievement
    and criterion tracking within TrinityCore's framework. The method returns a pointer
    to a constant list of criteria trees, ensuring data integrity while allowing read
    access. It is typically invoked when evaluating or displaying criteria-related
    information for players, such as progress toward achievements or rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a constant CriteriaTreeList containing all criteria trees
    associated with the specified criteria ID. Returns nullptr if no matching criteria
    trees are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through criteria trees for a specific criteria ID
    code: "uint32 criteriaId = 12345;\nconst CriteriaTreeList* trees = sCriteriaMgr->GetCriteriaTreesByCriteria(criteriaId);\n\
      if (trees)\n{\n    for (const auto& tree : *trees)\n    {\n        // Process\
      \ each criteria tree\n        printf(\"Criteria Tree ID: %u\\n\", tree->ID);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup based on internal data structures maintained
    by the CriteriaMgr. It is expected to be efficient as it uses indexed access patterns.
    The returned pointer should not be modified, and its lifetime is tied to the CriteriaMgr
    instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided criteriaId is valid before calling this method;
    invalid IDs may return nullptr without error. Do not attempt to modify the contents
    of the returned list as it is marked as const.
