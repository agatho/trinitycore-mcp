documentation:
  brief: Converts grid coordinates to world coordinates
  description: The GridToWorld method transforms grid-based coordinates (x, y) into
    their corresponding world coordinates. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to map cell positions within a grid system to actual world positions
    for object placement, movement calculations, and spatial queries. The method operates
    on the internal grid structure of the game world and returns an integer value
    representing the converted coordinate or an error code if the conversion fails.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the world coordinate value. A positive
    value indicates successful conversion, while negative values may indicate invalid
    input coordinates or conversion errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Grid to World Coordinate Conversion
    code: "PositionStrategyBase strategy;\nint worldX = strategy.GridToWorld(10, 15);\n\
      // Converts grid coordinates (10, 15) to world coordinate\nif (worldX >= 0)\n\
      {\n    // Successfully converted\n    printf(\"World X: %d\\n\", worldX);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's grid management
    system. The actual coordinate conversion logic depends on the specific implementation
    of PositionStrategyBase and the grid size configuration of the instance. Developers
    should ensure that input grid coordinates are within valid ranges to avoid unexpected
    results.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes no parameters, which suggests
    x and y values might be stored internally or accessed via other means. Be cautious
    when relying on this method without verifying proper initialization of internal
    state variables.
