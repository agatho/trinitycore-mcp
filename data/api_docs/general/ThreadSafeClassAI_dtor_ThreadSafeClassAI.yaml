  class: ThreadSafeClassAI
  method: ~ThreadSafeClassAI
  signature: void ThreadSafeClassAI::~ThreadSafeClassAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an instance of ThreadSafeClassAI, cleaning up allocated resources
    and ensuring thread-safe shutdown.
  description: The destructor for the ThreadSafeClassAI class is responsible for properly
    releasing all memory and resources associated with the AI instance. This method
    ensures that any dynamically allocated data, internal buffers, or references are
    safely deallocated to prevent memory leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a critical role in maintaining system
    stability when creatures or game objects are removed from the world. The method
    is designed to be thread-safe, meaning it can be called from any thread without
    causing race conditions or undefined behavior. It typically handles cleanup tasks
    such as releasing AI-specific data structures, notifying subsystems of object
    destruction, and ensuring that no dangling pointers remain in the system.

  - title: Basic Destruction of AI Instance
    code: 'ThreadSafeClassAI* ai = new ThreadSafeClassAI();

      // ... use the AI instance ...

      delete ai; // Triggers ~ThreadSafeClassAI() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. Since this class is thread-safe, it can be safely destroyed
    from any thread context. The implementation likely includes proper cleanup of
    internal synchronization primitives if used.
