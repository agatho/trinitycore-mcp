  class: SmartAI
  method: SetEvadeDisabled
  signature: void SmartAI::SetEvadeDisabled(bool disable)
documentation:
  brief: Disables or enables the evade behavior of a SmartAI unit.
  description: The SetEvadeDisabled method controls whether a SmartAI unit can enter
    evade mode when it loses its target or becomes unable to attack. When disabled,
    the unit will not automatically return to its initial position or reset its AI
    state upon losing aggro. This is commonly used in scripted encounters where specific
    AI behavior must be maintained regardless of combat state changes. The method
    directly modifies an internal flag within the SmartAI instance that governs evade
    logic.
  parameters:
  - name: disable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to disable (true) or enable (false)
      the evade behavior. When true, the unit will not evade; when false, normal evade
      behavior is restored.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable Evade During Boss Fight
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Unit* /*who*/) {\n    me->GetAI()->SetEvadeDisabled(true);\n\
      \    // Boss will not evade during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Enable Evade After Sequence Completion
    code: "void OnSpellFinished(SpellInfo const* spell) {\n    if (spell->Id == 12345)\
      \ // Specific spell\n        me->GetAI()->SetEvadeDisabled(false);\n    // Allow\
      \ normal evade behavior after sequence\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the SmartAI instance it is called on. It does not
    modify global AI settings or affect other units. The change takes immediate effect,
    and subsequent evade attempts will respect the new setting.
  warnings: Disabling evade can cause units to remain in combat state indefinitely
    if proper conditions are not managed. Ensure that alternative mechanisms exist
    to prevent infinite combat loops or stuck AI states.
