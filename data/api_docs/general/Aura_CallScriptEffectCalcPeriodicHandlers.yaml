  class: Aura
  method: CallScriptEffectCalcPeriodicHandlers
  signature: void Aura::CallScriptEffectCalcPeriodicHandlers(const AuraEffect * aurEff,
    bool & isPeriodic, int32 & amplitude)
documentation:
  brief: Calls script handlers to calculate periodic aura effect amplitude and update
    periodic status.
  description: The CallScriptEffectCalcPeriodicHandlers method invokes registered
    script handlers for a specific aura effect to determine whether the effect is
    periodic and to calculate its amplitude. This method is typically called during
    aura application or update cycles to ensure that scripted behavior correctly influences
    how periodic effects are processed. It modifies the provided parameters to reflect
    the calculated values from script handlers, which may override default calculations
    based on spell properties.
  parameters:
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect object for which periodic calculation is
      being performed. This parameter must not be null and represents the specific
      effect being evaluated.
  - name: isPeriodic
    description: Reference to a boolean flag indicating whether the aura effect is
      periodic. Script handlers may modify this value to change the periodic status
      of the effect.
  - name: amplitude
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the amplitude (interval
      in milliseconds) of the periodic effect. Script handlers can adjust this value
      to customize timing behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application
    code: "void MyAuraScript::OnApply(AuraEffect const* aurEff, AuraEffectHandleModes\
      \ mode)\n{\n    bool isPeriodic = true;\n    int32 amplitude = 1000;\n    GetAura()->CallScriptEffectCalcPeriodicHandlers(aurEff,\
      \ isPeriodic, amplitude);\n    // Use updated values for further processing\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura scripting system and should only be called
    during appropriate aura lifecycle events. The parameters 'isPeriodic' and 'amplitude'
    are modified in-place by script handlers, so any existing values will be overwritten.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of valid aura effect handling contexts
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the provided AuraEffect
    pointer is valid and not null.
