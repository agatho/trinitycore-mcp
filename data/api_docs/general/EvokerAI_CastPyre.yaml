  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastPyre
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastPyre(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Pyre spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastPyre method is used by EvokerAI to execute the Pyre spell against
    a designated target. This method likely handles the logic for selecting a valid
    target, checking spell requirements, and initiating the spell casting process.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's Evoker class, Pyre is a damage-over-time
    spell that applies a burning effect to enemies. The method operates within the
    AI framework of TrinityCore, managing the evoker's behavior during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index.
      This parameter specifies which entity the Pyre spell should be cast upon.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastPyre
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      ai->CastPyre(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EvokerAI class and should only be called when
    the AI has a valid target and the spell can be cast. The implementation likely
    includes checks for spell cooldowns, mana requirements, and line-of-sight conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid entity before calling
    this method. Passing an invalid or null target could result in undefined behavior
    or crashes within the TrinityCore framework.
