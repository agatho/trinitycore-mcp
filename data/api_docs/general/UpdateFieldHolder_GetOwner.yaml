  class: UpdateFieldHolder
  method: GetOwner
  signature: Object * UpdateFieldHolder::GetOwner()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the Object that owns this UpdateFieldHolder instance.
  description: The GetOwner method retrieves the Object instance that serves as the
    owner or parent of the current UpdateFieldHolder. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, UpdateFieldHolder is typically used to manage update
    fields for game objects such as players, creatures, and game objects. The returned
    Object pointer allows access to the owning entity's properties and methods. This
    method is commonly used during packet construction and object updates to ensure
    proper field synchronization with the owner's state. The method does not perform
    any validation on the ownership relationship and assumes that a valid owner has
    been set previously.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Object instance that owns this UpdateFieldHolder, or nullptr
    if no owner has been assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Access Owner Object
    code: "UpdateFieldHolder* holder = new UpdateFieldHolder();\nObject* owner = holder->GetOwner();\n\
      if (owner)\n{\n    // Use the owner object\n    sLog->outString(\"Owner type:\
      \ %u\", owner->GetTypeId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Owner in Update Field Processing
    code: "void ProcessUpdateFields(UpdateFieldHolder* holder)\n{\n    Object* owner\
      \ = holder->GetOwner();\n    if (!owner)\n        return;\n\n    // Example:\
      \ Accessing owner's GUID for update field population\n    uint64 guid = owner->GetGUID();\n\
      \    // ... further processing using the owner\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a raw pointer to the owning Object, so developers must
    ensure that the returned object remains valid for the duration of its usage. The
    ownership relationship is typically established during construction or initialization
    of the UpdateFieldHolder instance. This method is frequently called during update
    packet generation and should be optimized for performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer without verifying it's not
    null, as accessing a null owner could lead to crashes. The method assumes that
    the owner has been properly initialized; calling this on an uninitialized UpdateFieldHolder
    may return nullptr or undefined behavior.
