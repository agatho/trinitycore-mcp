documentation:
  brief: Resets the threat table for all units managed by this bot threat manager.
  description: The ResetThreat method clears and resets the internal threat tracking
    data structure used by the BotThreatManager. This operation removes all existing
    threat entries for NPCs or creatures that are being monitored by the bot's threat
    management system. It effectively resets the threat state to an initial empty
    condition, allowing new threat calculations to begin from scratch. The method
    is typically invoked when a bot needs to re-evaluate its targeting strategy or
    when transitioning between different combat scenarios where previous threat data
    would be invalid.

  - title: Basic Threat Reset Usage
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatManager = bot->GetThreatManager();

      threatManager->ResetThreat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it invalidates all current threat
    data. It is recommended to call ResetThreat() before initiating a new combat phase
    or when switching targets to ensure accurate threat calculations.
