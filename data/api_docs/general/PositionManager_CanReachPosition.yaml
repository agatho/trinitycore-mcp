  class: PositionManager
  method: CanReachPosition
  signature: bool PositionManager::CanReachPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified position is reachable within the current game
    world context.
  description: The CanReachPosition method evaluates if a given position can be reached
    by the associated entity, taking into account factors such as terrain, obstacles,
    and movement constraints. This method is commonly used in pathfinding algorithms,
    AI behavior logic, and player interaction validation. It typically checks for
    line-of-sight, height differences, and navigational validity between the current
    location and the target position. The result is essential for determining if an
    action or movement to that position is feasible within the game's physics and
    navigation system.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This value usually corresponds to a unique index or hash of a location,
      often derived from a Position object or coordinate system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is reachable based on current navigation
    constraints and false otherwise. The method may return false due to physical barriers,
    height discrepancies, or invalid position data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (positionManager.CanReachPosition(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ or action\n    player.MoveToPosition(12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle unreachable\
      \ position\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Target position is not reachable.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making
    code: "bool isReachable = positionManager.CanReachPosition(targetPositionId);\n\
      if (isReachable && !player.IsInCombat()) {\n    // AI can pursue target\n  \
      \  aiBehavior.SetTarget(targetPositionId);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ path or wait\n    aiBehavior.FindAlternativePath();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh and world data structures.
    Performance may vary depending on the complexity of the terrain and number of
    obstacles between positions. The method assumes that the position identifier is
    valid and corresponds to a known location in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the position ID passed to this method is valid; invalid IDs
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This method does not account
    for dynamic changes in the environment during execution, so it should be called
    with up-to-date position data.
