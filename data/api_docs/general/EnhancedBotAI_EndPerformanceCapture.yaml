  method: EndPerformanceCapture
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::EndPerformanceCapture(std::chrono::microseconds elapsed)
documentation:
  brief: Ends performance capture for the enhanced bot AI and records elapsed time.
  description: The EndPerformanceCapture method terminates a performance measurement
    session initiated by a corresponding StartPerformanceCapture call. It takes the
    measured elapsed time in microseconds and logs or processes this data for performance
    analysis. This method is typically used within the EnhancedBotAI class to monitor
    and optimize bot behavior execution times, ensuring that AI operations remain
    efficient and do not introduce performance bottlenecks. The method does not require
    any specific preconditions beyond a valid performance capture session having been
    started.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::chrono::microseconds elapsed(1500);

      botAI->EndPerformanceCapture(elapsed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a performance monitoring system within the EnhancedBotAI
    class. It's designed to work in conjunction with StartPerformanceCapture to provide
    accurate timing data for bot AI operations. The elapsed time parameter should
    represent the duration since the last StartPerformanceCapture call.
