  class: ScopedLearningExperiment
  method: ScopedLearningExperiment
  signature: void ScopedLearningExperiment::ScopedLearningExperiment(const std::string
    & name, const std::string & configuration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new scoped learning experiment with the specified name and
    configuration.
  description: The ScopedLearningExperiment constructor initializes a new instance
    of the ScopedLearningExperiment class, setting up internal state based on the
    provided experiment name and configuration parameters. This method is typically
    used to define the scope and parameters of a learning experiment within the TrinityCore
    framework, which may involve setting up data structures, initializing logging
    mechanisms, or preparing resources for machine learning or behavioral analysis
    tasks. The constructor ensures that all necessary prerequisites are met before
    the experiment can be executed, including validation of input parameters and allocation
    of required system resources.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique identifier string for the learning experiment. This name
      is used to distinguish between different experiments and may be referenced in
      logs or reports.
  - name: configuration
    description: A string containing configuration settings for the experiment. The
      format and content of this string depend on the specific implementation but
      typically includes parameters such as learning rate, iteration count, or other
      algorithm-specific settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Experiment Initialization
    code: ScopedLearningExperiment experiment("PlayerBehaviorAnalysis", "iterations=1000;learning_rate=0.01");
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Dynamic Configuration
    code: 'std::string config = "epochs=" + std::to_string(epochCount) + ";batch_size="
      + std::to_string(batchSize);

      ScopedLearningExperiment experiment("ModelTraining", config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the initialization phase of a
    TrinityCore module or subsystem that requires learning-based behavior modification.
    The implementation may perform validation checks on the input parameters and could
    throw exceptions if invalid values are provided.
  warnings: Ensure that the configuration string follows the expected format for the
    specific learning algorithm being used, as malformed configurations can lead to
    runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Avoid using special characters in experiment
    names that might conflict with file system operations.
