  class: RoleBasedCombatPositioning
  method: GetAverageCalculationTime
  signature: float RoleBasedCombatPositioning::GetAverageCalculationTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average time taken to perform combat positioning
    calculations.
  description: The GetAverageCalculationTime method retrieves the average duration,
    in seconds, that the RoleBasedCombatPositioning system takes to compute optimal
    positioning for units during combat. This metric is typically used for performance
    monitoring and tuning of AI behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The value is updated dynamically as calculations are performed, reflecting recent
    performance trends rather than a static configuration. This method does not require
    any parameters and returns a floating-point number representing the average time
    in seconds.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average calculation time in seconds. Returns
    0.0f if no calculations have been performed yet or if the system has not initialized
    properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float avgTime = combatPositioning.GetAverageCalculationTime();

      printf("Average calculation time: %.4f seconds\n", avgTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "RoleBasedCombatPositioning positioning;\n// ... perform some combat positioning\
      \ calculations ...\nfloat avg = positioning.GetAverageCalculationTime();\nif\
      \ (avg > 0.01f) // Threshold for slow performance\n{\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_AI,\
      \ \"Warning: Combat positioning is taking %.4f seconds on average\", avg);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within AI update loops or performance
    profiling systems. The returned value may be affected by system load and the complexity
    of the current combat scenario. It's recommended to call this method periodically
    for accurate monitoring rather than relying on a single measurement.
  warnings: The average calculation time might not reflect instantaneous performance
    if the system is under heavy load or if calculations are batched. In high-frequency
    AI scenarios, frequent calls to this method could introduce minor overhead.
