documentation:
  brief: Executes a dispel operation on targeted units within the coordinator's scope
  description: The ExecuteDispel method performs the core logic for removing magical
    effects from affected targets. It iterates through all registered dispel targets,
    evaluates their current state and dispel eligibility, and applies the appropriate
    dispel mechanics. This method is typically invoked during spell casting or aura
    application phases where magical effects need to be removed from units. The operation
    respects factional relationships, dispel resistance checks, and target validity
    conditions before proceeding with actual dispel application.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one dispel was successfully executed on a valid
    target, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate no eligible targets
    were found or all targets were immune to the dispel effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dispel Execution
    code: "DispelCoordinator coordinator;\n// Add targets to coordinator...\nbool\
      \ success = coordinator.ExecuteDispel();\nif (success)\n{\n    // Dispels were\
      \ applied\n    sLog->outString(\"Dispel operation completed successfully.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the DispelCoordinator has been properly initialized
    with valid targets and dispel parameters. The method is designed to be thread-safe
    when used with proper synchronization mechanisms around target management. Performance
    may degrade if large numbers of targets are registered without filtering.
  warnings: Calling ExecuteDispel without prior registration of targets may result
    in undefined behavior or no-op execution. Ensure that all targets have valid aura
    states before calling this method to avoid potential crashes or incorrect dispel
    application.
