  class: AuctionBotBuyer
  method: Update
  signature: bool AuctionBotBuyer::Update(AuctionHouseType houseType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction bot buyer's state and processes auction house transactions
    for the specified auction house type.
  description: The Update method in the AuctionBotBuyer class is responsible for refreshing
    the internal state of the auction bot buyer and executing any necessary actions
    related to buying items from the auction house. It typically handles tasks such
    as scanning available auctions, evaluating bid prices, and placing bids based
    on configured rules. The method operates on a specified auction house type, which
    determines the context in which the auction activities take place. This method
    is generally called periodically by the game server's update loop to ensure that
    the bot remains active and responsive to market changes.
  parameters:
  - name: houseType
    description: Specifies the type of auction house to process updates for. Valid
      values are typically defined in the AuctionHouseType enumeration, such as AH_TYPE_ALLIANCE,
      AH_TYPE_HORDE, or AH_TYPE_NEUTRAL.
  returns: Returns true if the update was successful and no errors occurred during
    processing; otherwise returns false, indicating a failure or an interruption in
    the update cycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "AuctionBotBuyer buyer;\nbool success = buyer.Update(AH_TYPE_ALLIANCE);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Proceed with further logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Update in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop() {\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32 currentTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    \n    if (currentTime - lastUpdate > 5000) { // Every\
      \ 5 seconds\n        AuctionBotBuyer buyer;\n        buyer.Update(AH_TYPE_NEUTRAL);\n\
      \        lastUpdate = currentTime;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method may perform database operations and network communication with
    the auction house system, so it should not be called too frequently to avoid performance
    degradation. It is recommended that this method be invoked from a dedicated thread
    or within a controlled update loop.
  warnings: Calling Update without proper initialization of the AuctionBotBuyer instance
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all required configurations
    and data are loaded before invoking this method.
