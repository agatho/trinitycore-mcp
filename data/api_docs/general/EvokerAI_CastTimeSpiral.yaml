documentation:
  brief: Initiates the casting of the Time Spiral spell for the Evoker AI.
  description: The CastTimeSpiral method is responsible for triggering the Time Spiral
    ability within the Evoker AI's behavior system. This method likely handles the
    logic required to cast the spell, including checking for valid targets, ensuring
    the spell is not on cooldown, and managing the AI's state during the casting process.
    The implementation would typically involve interacting with the core TrinityCore
    spell system to execute the actual spell effect. It is part of the Evoker's combat
    AI and is invoked when the AI determines that casting Time Spiral is beneficial
    for the current situation.

  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker AI Context
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Example condition to trigger Time Spiral\n        if (HealthBelowPct(30))\n\
      \        {\n            CastTimeSpiral();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Evoker's AI implementation and assumes that the
    AI has been properly initialized with a valid creature object. The actual spell
    casting behavior depends on the underlying TrinityCore spell system and may involve
    additional checks such as line-of-sight, mana availability, or target validity.
  warnings: Ensure that the EvokerAI instance is in a valid combat state before calling
    this method to avoid unexpected behavior. Improper usage might lead to incorrect
    AI behavior or spell execution errors if not properly integrated with the core
    AI update loop.
