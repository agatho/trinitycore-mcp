  method: AI_Destroy
  signature: void AreaTrigger::AI_Destroy()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the AreaTrigger's AI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The AI_Destroy method is responsible for properly disposing of the
    AreaTrigger's AI component. This method ensures that any dynamically allocated
    memory, active references, or ongoing processes related to the AreaTrigger's AI
    behavior are safely terminated and cleaned up. It is typically invoked when the
    AreaTrigger is being removed from the game world or when its AI functionality
    needs to be explicitly destroyed. The method performs necessary cleanup operations
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain the stability of the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AreaTrigger Event Handler
    code: "void OnAreaTriggerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    // ... some logic ...\n\
      \    if (player->HasAura(12345))\n    {\n        // Destroy AI when condition\
      \ is met\n        AI_Destroy();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AreaTrigger's AI is no longer
    needed. Calling it multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The destruction process is designed to be safe and thread-aware, but
    developers should ensure that no other threads are actively using the AI component
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Never call AI_Destroy() on an AreaTrigger that has already been destroyed
    or is in the process of being destroyed. Doing so may result in memory corruption
    or access violations. Also, avoid calling this method from within AI callbacks
    unless you're certain it's safe to do so.
