  class: Map
  method: GetVisibilityRange
  signature: float Map::GetVisibilityRange() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the visibility range of the map, which determines the maximum distance
    at which objects can be seen.
  description: The GetVisibilityRange method retrieves the visibility range for a
    given map, which is used to determine how far objects can be seen in the game
    world. This value is crucial for determining the visibility of players and NPCs
    within the map, as well as for managing object streaming and visibility calculations.
    The method returns a float value representing the maximum distance in yards at
    which objects are visible, typically set by the game server based on map-specific
    settings or configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the visibility range in yards. This
    value indicates the maximum distance at which objects can be seen within the map,
    with typical values ranging from 100 to 300 yards depending on the map type and
    configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float visibilityRange = map->GetVisibilityRange();

      std::cout << "Visibility range: " << visibilityRange << " yards" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other visibility-related
    functions to determine object streaming behavior. The value returned by GetVisibilityRange
    may vary between different map types (e.g., cities, dungeons, outdoor areas) and
    can be influenced by server configuration settings.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it directly affects the
    visibility of objects in the game world. Incorrect use of visibility range values
    can lead to performance issues or incorrect visibility calculations.
