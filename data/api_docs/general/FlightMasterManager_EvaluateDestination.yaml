  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: EvaluateDestination
  signature: FlightPathEvaluation FlightMasterManager::EvaluateDestination(const TaxiNodesEntry
    * from, const TaxiNodesEntry * to) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the flight path between two taxi nodes and returns the flight path
    evaluation result.
  description: The EvaluateDestination method calculates and returns a FlightPathEvaluation
    object that contains information about the flight path from a starting taxi node
    to a destination taxi node. This method is typically used by the FlightMasterManager
    to determine whether a player can fly between specific locations, including distance,
    travel time, and any potential restrictions or costs associated with the flight.
    It does not modify any state but provides a read-only evaluation of the flight
    path based on the provided taxi node entries. The method assumes valid input parameters
    and may return an invalid evaluation if the nodes are not connected or do not
    exist in the taxi system.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry representing the starting taxi node
      for the flight path evaluation.
  - name: to
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry representing the destination taxi node
      for the flight path evaluation.
  returns: A FlightPathEvaluation object containing details about the flight path,
    including distance, travel time, and other relevant metrics. Returns an invalid
    evaluation if the nodes are not connected or do not exist in the taxi system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EvaluateDestination
    code: "const TaxiNodesEntry* startNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      const TaxiNodesEntry* endNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(5678);\nFlightPathEvaluation\
      \ eval = flightMasterManager.EvaluateDestination(startNode, endNode);\nif (eval.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process valid flight path evaluation\n    std::cout << \"Distance:\
      \ \" << eval.GetDistance() << \" yards\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the FlightMasterManager's core functionality and is
    used internally by the taxi system to validate flight paths. It does not perform
    any side effects or modify data, making it safe for read-only operations. Performance-wise,
    this method should be fast as it only evaluates precomputed path data.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'from' and 'to' parameters are valid pointers to existing
    TaxiNodesEntry objects; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The returned FlightPathEvaluation
    object must be checked for validity before accessing its members.
