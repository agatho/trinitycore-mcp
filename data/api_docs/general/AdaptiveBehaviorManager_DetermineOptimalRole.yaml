  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: DetermineOptimalRole
  signature: BotRole AdaptiveBehaviorManager::DetermineOptimalRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal bot role based on current combat state
    and team composition.
  description: The DetermineOptimalRole method evaluates various factors including
    the bot's current health, mana levels, available targets, and the roles of other
    players in the group to assign an appropriate BotRole. This method is crucial
    for dynamic AI behavior adjustment during encounters, ensuring that each bot contributes
    effectively to the team's strategy. The decision-making process considers both
    immediate tactical needs and long-term group objectives, making it a core component
    of adaptive gameplay logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a BotRole enum value indicating the recommended role for the bot.
    Possible values may include ATTACKER, TANK, HEALER, or SUPPORT depending on the
    current situation and team requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotRole role = behaviorManager.DetermineOptimalRole();\nswitch (role)\n\
      {\n    case BotRole::ATTACKER:\n        // Execute attack-oriented actions\n\
      \        break;\n    case BotRole::TANK:\n        // Prepare for tanking responsibilities\n\
      \        break;\n    case BotRole::HEALER:\n        // Focus on healing and\
      \ support\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle unknown or neutral\
      \ roles\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat scenarios to allow for
    dynamic role switching as conditions change. The implementation may cache previous
    results to avoid unnecessary recalculations, but it's designed to respond quickly
    to significant changes in the environment.
  warnings: The returned BotRole might not always align with a bot's capabilities
    or class restrictions; developers should validate that the assigned role is feasible
    for the specific bot instance before applying it.
