  class: Unit
  method: GetProcChainLength
  signature: int32 Unit::GetProcChainLength() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the length of the proc chain for the unit.
  description: This method retrieves the current length of the proc chain associated
    with the unit, which represents the number of consecutive procs that can occur
    in sequence. The proc chain length is used in game mechanics to determine how
    many times a proc effect can trigger consecutively without resetting. This value
    is typically used in conjunction with other proc-related methods to manage combat
    behavior and ensure proper execution of abilities that have proc-based effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the current proc chain length. A
    value of 0 indicates no active proc chain, while positive values indicate the
    number of consecutive procs that can occur.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int32 chainLength = unit->GetProcChainLength();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in combat calculations and may be affected
    by various buffs or debuffs. It's important to note that the value returned represents
    the current state of the proc chain, not necessarily a fixed value.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    proc-related methods, as incorrect handling can lead to improper combat behavior
    or unexpected results.
