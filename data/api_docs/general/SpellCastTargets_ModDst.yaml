  method: ModDst
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::ModDst(const SpellDestination & spellDest)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the destination of a spell cast target by updating its spell destination.
  description: The ModDst method updates the destination coordinates and orientation
    for a spell cast target. This is typically used during spell casting to adjust
    where a spell will be cast, such as modifying the target position or orientation
    before execution. The method modifies the internal spell destination data structure
    of the SpellCastTargets object, allowing dynamic changes to spell targeting behavior
    during runtime. This functionality is essential for spells that require precise
    positioning or have special targeting mechanics like area-of-effect spells with
    adjustable origins.
  parameters:
  - name: spellDest
    description: A const reference to a SpellDestination object containing the new
      destination coordinates, orientation, and related data for the spell cast target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Spell Destination Coordinates
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      SpellDestination newDest;

      newDest.Relocate(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      targets.ModDst(newDest);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Spell Target Orientation
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      SpellDestination dest;

      dest.Relocate(50.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f);

      dest.m_orientation = M_PI / 4; // Set to 45 degrees

      targets.ModDst(dest);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the SpellCastTargets
    object and should be used carefully during spell execution. The updated destination
    will affect how the spell is processed and visualized in the game world. Ensure
    that the provided SpellDestination data is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Modifying spell destinations after initial setup may cause unexpected
    targeting behavior or visual glitches. This method should only be called when
    necessary during spell processing, not during initialization phases where targets
    are being set up for the first time.
