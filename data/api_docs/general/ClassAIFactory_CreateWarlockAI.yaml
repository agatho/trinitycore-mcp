documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Warlock AI instance for a bot player
  description: The CreateWarlockAI method is responsible for instantiating a Warlock
    AI behavior for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the appropriate AI state machine,
    and configures the bot's spell casting abilities according to warlock class mechanics.
    The method returns an identifier that can be used to reference the created AI
    instance. This functionality is typically used in bot management systems where
    AI-controlled characters need to be dynamically created and assigned specific
    class-based behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer that will receive the unique identifier of
      the created Warlock AI instance. The value pointed to by this parameter is set
      upon successful creation of the AI component.
  returns: Returns 0 on successful creation of the Warlock AI instance, or a non-zero
    error code if the operation fails. A return value of 0 indicates that the bot
    was successfully initialized with Warlock AI behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Warlock AI Creation
    code: "int botId;\nint result = factory->CreateWarlockAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Successfully created Warlock AI with ID: botId\n    printf(\"\
      Created Warlock AI with ID: %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to create Warlock AI\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the underlying bot system is properly initialized
    and that sufficient resources are available for creating new AI instances. The
    returned bot identifier should be stored for future reference when managing or
    updating the bot's behavior.
  warnings: The parameter 'bot' must point to a valid integer variable; passing NULL
    or an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the TrinityCore
    environment has been properly initialized before calling this method.
