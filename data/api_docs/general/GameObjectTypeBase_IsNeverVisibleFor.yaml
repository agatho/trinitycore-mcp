documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a game object is never visible to a specific player or
    creature based on its type and visibility settings.
  description: The IsNeverVisibleFor method checks if a GameObjectTypeBase instance
    should never be visible to a particular observer, such as a player or creature.
    This check takes into account the object's inherent visibility properties and
    whether it is a server-side object. The method evaluates the visibility rules
    defined for the game object type and returns true if the object is explicitly
    marked as never visible to the specified seer. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    visibility system to prevent certain objects from being rendered or interacted
    with by specific entities, particularly useful for dynamic or conditional objects
    that should not appear under certain circumstances.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the observer (player or creature)
      for which visibility is being checked. This typically points to a GUID or similar
      identifier used internally by TrinityCore's visibility system.
  - name: allowServersideObjects
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether server-side objects should be considered
      in the visibility check. When true, server-side objects may be visible; when
      false, they are typically excluded from visibility calculations.
  returns: Returns true if the game object is never visible to the specified seer,
    considering both its type and the allowServersideObjects flag. Returns false otherwise,
    indicating that the object might be visible under certain conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage checking visibility for a player
    code: "GameObjectTypeBase* goType = ...; // Get reference to game object type\n\
      int playerGuid = 12345;\nbool isVisible = goType->IsNeverVisibleFor(&playerGuid,\
      \ false);\nif (!isVisible) {\n    // Object is visible to the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking visibility with server-side objects allowed
    code: "GameObjectTypeBase* goType = ...;\nint creatureGuid = 67890;\nbool isVisible\
      \ = goType->IsNeverVisibleFor(&creatureGuid, true);\nif (isVisible) {\n    //\
      \ Object is visible to the creature\n} else {\n    // Object is never visible\
      \ to the creature\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal visibility system and is typically
    called during object update cycles or when determining what objects should be
    sent to a client. The seer parameter usually refers to a GUID stored in an int
    array, which may represent either a player or creature. Performance-wise, this
    check should be fast as it relies on precomputed flags and type-based logic rather
    than complex runtime evaluations.
  warnings: Ensure that the seer pointer is valid and points to a meaningful identifier
    before calling this method. Passing null or invalid pointers can lead to undefined
    behavior. Also note that this method does not account for dynamic visibility changes
    during runtime; it only evaluates static properties of the GameObjectTypeBase.
