documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of all item modifiers in the list
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the modification tracking state
    for all items within the ItemModList. This function is typically used to indicate
    that previously modified item properties have been synchronized or committed,
    clearing any pending change flags. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method helps manage item state consistency between the server
    and client by ensuring that change notifications are properly reset after synchronization
    operations. The method does not alter the actual item values but only clears internal
    tracking bits that indicate which properties have been modified since last synchronization.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ItemModList itemMods;

      // ... populate itemMods with various item modifiers ...

      itemMods.ClearChangesMask();

      // All change flags are now cleared, indicating no pending modifications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after sending item updates to players or when
    committing changes to the database. It's an essential part of maintaining synchronization
    between server-side item state and client-side representations in TrinityCore.
