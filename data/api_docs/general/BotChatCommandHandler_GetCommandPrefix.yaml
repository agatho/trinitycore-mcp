  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: GetCommandPrefix
  signature: std::string BotChatCommandHandler::GetCommandPrefix()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the command prefix used by the bot chat command handler to identify
    and process chat commands.
  description: The GetCommandPrefix method returns the string prefix that is used
    by the BotChatCommandHandler to determine whether an incoming chat message should
    be processed as a bot command. This prefix is typically a character or sequence
    of characters (such as '!' or '/') that distinguishes bot commands from regular
    chat messages. The method is essential for proper command routing within the TrinityCore
    framework's bot system, ensuring that only messages beginning with the defined
    prefix are interpreted as commands. It does not modify any internal state and
    is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string representing the command prefix used by the BotChatCommandHandler
    to identify bot commands in chat messages.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Command Prefix
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      std::string prefix = handler.GetCommandPrefix();

      printf("Bot command prefix is: %s\n", prefix.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or configuration of
    bot command handling. The returned string should be consistent with the configuration
    settings that define how bot commands are recognized in the game environment.
