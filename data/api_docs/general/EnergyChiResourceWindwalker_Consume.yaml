  class: EnergyChiResourceWindwalker
  method: Consume
  signature: bool EnergyChiResourceWindwalker::Consume(uint32 energyCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of energy cost from the Windwalker's resource
    pool and returns whether the operation was successful.
  description: The Consume method attempts to reduce the current energy or chi resource
    level of a Windwalker class character by the specified energyCost amount. This
    method is typically used in game mechanics where abilities or actions require
    a certain amount of energy or chi to be spent. It checks if sufficient resources
    are available before deducting them. If the requested cost exceeds the available
    resources, the operation fails and returns false without modifying the resource
    pool. The method ensures that resource management is handled consistently within
    the Windwalker's gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: energyCost
    description: The amount of energy or chi to be consumed from the resource pool.
      Must be a non-negative integer value representing the cost of an ability or
      action.
  returns: Returns true if the specified energyCost was successfully deducted from
    the resource pool, otherwise returns false when insufficient resources are available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetEnergyChiResourceWindwalker()->Consume(50)) {\n    // Ability\
      \ executed successfully\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_WINDWALKER_ABILITY);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough energy/chi to cast ability\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough energy.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Check Before Consumption
    code: "uint32 requiredEnergy = 100;\nif (player->GetEnergyChiResourceWindwalker()->GetEnergy()\
      \ >= requiredEnergy) {\n    if (player->GetEnergyChiResourceWindwalker()->Consume(requiredEnergy))\
      \ {\n        // Execute high-cost ability\n        player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_HIGH_ENERGY_ABILITY);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal energy or chi resource state of
    the Windwalker class. It is designed to be thread-safe within the context of TrinityCore's
    single-threaded game loop. The implementation assumes that all resource management
    operations are performed in a controlled environment where concurrent access is
    managed by the core engine.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the requested energyCost
    is valid and non-negative. Calling with a negative value may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect resource calculations. Always check return values before
    proceeding with ability execution to prevent invalid actions.
