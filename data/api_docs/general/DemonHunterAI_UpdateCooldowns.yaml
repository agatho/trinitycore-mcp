  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for Demon Hunter abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown timers for various Demon Hunter abilities within the AI
    system. This method is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure
    that ability cooldowns are accurately tracked and that abilities can be properly
    used when their cooldowns have expired. The method processes the time difference
    (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last update,
    which is essential for accurate cooldown calculations. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining proper Demon Hunter gameplay mechanics, ensuring abilities are
    not used prematurely and that the AI behaves according to the game's cooldown
    rules.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update cycle.
      This value is used to calculate how much time has passed and update the cooldown
      timers accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCooldowns Usage
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // ... combat logic ...\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    // ... more combat logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. The diff parameter must accurately reflect the time
    elapsed since the last call to ensure proper cooldown calculations. This method
    is part of the core Demon Hunter AI behavior and directly affects ability usage
    timing.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect cooldown
    calculations, potentially causing abilities to be used too early or too late.
    Ensure this method is called consistently within the AI update cycle for reliable
    behavior.
