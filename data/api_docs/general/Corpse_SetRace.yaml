  class: Corpse
  method: SetRace
  signature: void Corpse::SetRace(int race)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the race of the corpse to the specified race ID.
  description: The SetRace method updates the racial identifier associated with a
    Corpse object. This is typically used when a player dies and their corpse is created,
    or when modifying the appearance or properties of a corpse in the game world.
    The race parameter should correspond to a valid race ID defined in the game's
    database or client files. This method directly modifies internal state of the
    corpse and may affect how the corpse appears or behaves in certain contexts, such
    as during loot distribution or resurrection mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: An integer representing the race ID to assign to the corpse. Valid
      values correspond to race definitions in the game's database (e.g., 1 for Human,
      2 for Orc, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Corpse Race to Human
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized

      corpse->SetRace(1); // Sets the corpse''s race to Human'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Race Assignment Based on Player Data
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nCorpse* corpse =\
      \ player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->SetRace(player->getRace());\
      \ // Sets corpse race to match player's race\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state of the Corpse object and should be used
    carefully. It does not validate the provided race ID against valid races, so invalid
    IDs may cause undefined behavior or visual glitches in the client. The change
    is immediate and affects only this specific corpse instance.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent race ID can lead to graphical errors
    or crashes in the client. Ensure that the race value corresponds to a known race
    in the game's database before calling this method. This method should not be called
    during critical gameplay states where the corpse is actively being processed by
    the server.
