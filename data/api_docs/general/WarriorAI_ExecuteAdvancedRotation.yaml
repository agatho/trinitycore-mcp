  class: WarriorAI
  method: ExecuteAdvancedRotation
  signature: void WarriorAI::ExecuteAdvancedRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the advanced combat rotation logic for a warrior AI unit targeting
    the specified enemy.
  description: The ExecuteAdvancedRotation method is responsible for performing the
    core decision-making and ability execution logic for a WarriorAI-controlled unit.
    It evaluates the current combat state, available abilities, resource levels (such
    as rage or fury), and target conditions to determine the optimal sequence of actions.
    This method typically integrates with the warrior's class-specific mechanics like
    stance management, cooldown tracking, and threat generation. The method assumes
    that a valid target has been provided and that the AI is in an appropriate combat
    state. It may modify the unit's behavior, cast spells, or trigger abilities based
    on the calculated rotation strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the current enemy target.
      This parameter is required and must point to a valid Unit instance; otherwise,
      the method may cause undefined behavior or crash.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    ExecuteAdvancedRotation(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with conditional targeting
    code: "void WarriorAI::ExecuteAdvancedRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Prioritize abilities based\
      \ on combat state\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Execute rotation logic\n    // ... implementation details ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked directly unless the AI state is properly initialized. The method
    relies heavily on internal warrior-specific variables such as stance, rage levels,
    and cooldowns, which are managed by the base AI class.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target can lead to crashes or unexpected
    behavior. Ensure that the target unit is alive and within combat range before
    invoking this function. Do not call this method during spell casts or other non-idle
    states unless explicitly designed for such use cases.
