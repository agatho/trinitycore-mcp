  class: Spell
  method: GetRemainingCastTime
  signature: int32 Spell::GetRemainingCastTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the spell's cast duration.
  description: The GetRemainingCastTime method retrieves the time remaining until
    a spell finishes casting. This value represents the duration of time left for
    the spell to complete its casting process, which is crucial for determining when
    a spell will finish and become available for use again. It typically returns a
    positive integer representing milliseconds, though it may return zero if the spell
    has already completed its cast or if no cast is currently in progress. This method
    is commonly used in conjunction with other spell-related functions to manage spell
    cooldowns and timing mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the remaining time in milliseconds
    for the spell's cast duration. If the spell has completed its cast or is not currently
    casting, this value will be zero. Negative values may indicate an error condition
    or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 remainingTime = spell->GetRemainingCastTime();\nif (remainingTime\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Spell is still casting\n    // Do something with the remaining\
      \ time\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Spell has finished casting\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It
    should only be used when a spell is actively being cast, as it may return invalid
    values otherwise. Performance considerations are minimal since this method simply
    reads stored values without complex computations.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method on spells that have already completed their
    casting process or are not currently casting, as it may return incorrect values
    or zero. Also note that the returned value is in milliseconds and should be converted
    appropriately for display purposes if needed.
