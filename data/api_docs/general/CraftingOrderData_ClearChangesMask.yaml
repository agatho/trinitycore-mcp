documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the crafting order data, resetting its modified
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the CraftingOrderData object. This operation typically indicates that any
    previous modifications to the crafting order have been acknowledged or committed,
    and the object is no longer marked as having pending changes. In the context of
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method is commonly used when synchronizing
    crafting order data with the client or persisting changes to the database. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  notes: This method is typically called after applying or acknowledging changes to
    prevent redundant updates. It's an essential part of the data synchronization
    process in crafting systems.
