  class: WarriorAI

  signature: void WarriorAI::UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the advanced combat logic for a warrior AI unit based on the current
    target.
  description: The UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic method is responsible for executing sophisticated
    combat behaviors specific to warrior AI units within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method evaluates the current combat state, target position, and available
    abilities to determine optimal actions such as stance switching, ability usage,
    or movement adjustments. It integrates with the broader AI system to ensure that
    warriors make intelligent decisions during combat encounters, taking into account
    factors like threat levels, health status, and tactical positioning. The method
    is typically called during each AI update cycle to maintain dynamic and responsive
    combat behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter is essential for determining combat decisions and should not
      be null when the method is invoked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in warrior AI update
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(mVictim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom warrior behavior
    code: "void MyWarriorAI::UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Custom\
      \ logic before calling base implementation\n    if (me->HasAura(SPELL_BATTLE_SHOUT))\n\
      \        DoCast(me, SPELL_BLOOD_FURY);\n    \n    // Call parent implementation\n\
      \    WarriorAI::UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update loop and should be called regularly
    to maintain responsive combat behavior. The method assumes that a valid target
    exists and may behave unpredictably if passed a null pointer. Performance considerations
    include avoiding expensive operations within this method as it's called frequently
    during combat.
  warnings: Never pass a null pointer to this method as it will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method modifies internal AI state and should not be
    called from multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
