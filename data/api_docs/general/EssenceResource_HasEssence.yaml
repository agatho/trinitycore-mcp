documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a specified number of essence charges available.
  description: The HasEssence method determines whether the player currently possesses
    at least the specified number of essence charges. This method is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to validate resource availability
    before allowing certain abilities or actions that require essence. The check is
    performed against the internal essence charge counter maintained by the EssenceResource
    class, which tracks the player's current essence reserves. This method does not
    modify the charge count but simply evaluates the current state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified number of essence
    charges available; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetEssenceResource()->HasEssence(5)) {\n    // Player has at\
      \ least 5 essence charges\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ESSENCE_BURST);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Activation
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target && player->GetEssenceResource()->HasEssence(3))\
      \ {\n    // Only cast the ability if enough essence is available\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ESSENCE_SHIELD);\n} else {\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough essence\
      \ to cast this spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the current essence charge state and does not account
    for any pending changes or temporary modifiers. It's typically used in conjunction
    with other resource management methods like GetCharges() or ConsumeCharges().
    The implementation assumes that essence charges are non-negative integers and
    that the player's essence resource is properly initialized.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in rapid succession without proper
    cooldowns, as it might lead to inconsistent behavior if essence charges are modified
    by other systems between checks. Also, ensure that the EssenceResource object
    is valid before calling this method to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.
