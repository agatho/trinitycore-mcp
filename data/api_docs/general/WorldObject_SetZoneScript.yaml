documentation:
  brief: Initializes or updates the zone script context for this WorldObject instance
  description: The SetZoneScript method is responsible for establishing or updating
    the zone-specific script context associated with a WorldObject. This method typically
    gets invoked during object creation, zone transitions, or when zone-related scripts
    need to be activated or reinitialized. It ensures that the object's behavior and
    interactions within its current zone are properly configured according to zone-specific
    rules and triggers. The method does not take any parameters and performs internal
    logic to associate the appropriate zone script with the object based on its location
    and current zone settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Object Creation
    code: "void SomeGameObject::OnSpawn()\n{\n    // Initialize zone script when object\
      \ spawns\n    SetZoneScript();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During Zone Transition
    code: "void Player::OnZoneChange()\n{\n    // Reinitialize zone script after zone\
      \ change\n    SetZoneScript();\n    // Additional zone-specific logic can follow\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    object lifecycle events. Developers should not generally need to call this method
    directly unless implementing custom zone script behavior or debugging zone-related
    issues. The actual implementation may involve looking up zone scripts based on
    current coordinates and updating internal state references.
  warnings: Calling SetZoneScript manually inappropriately can lead to inconsistent
    zone script states or memory leaks if not properly synchronized with the object's
    lifecycle. This method should only be invoked when the object is in a valid state
    for zone script association.
