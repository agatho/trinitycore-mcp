  class: Aura
  method: GetSpellVisual
  signature: int Aura::GetSpellVisual() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell visual ID associated with the aura.
  description: The GetSpellVisual method returns the spell visual identifier that
    is linked to the aura. This ID corresponds to a specific visual effect displayed
    in the game client when the aura is active on a unit. The returned value typically
    maps to an entry in the SpellVisual.dbc file within the TrinityCore database,
    which defines how spells and auras should appear visually to players. This method
    is commonly used for aura-based visual effects, such as buff icons, debuff displays,
    or special effects triggered by auras.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spell visual ID associated with this aura.
    A value of 0 typically indicates no visual effect is defined or the aura does
    not have a visual component.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Aura Visual
    code: "Aura* aura = unit->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int spellVisualId\
      \ = aura->GetSpellVisual();\n    if (spellVisualId != 0)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Process the visual effect\n        sLog->outString(\"Aura has spell visual\
      \ ID: %d\", spellVisualId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures of the aura and should be used
    carefully in performance-sensitive contexts. It is safe to call from any thread
    that has access to the aura object, but direct manipulation of aura visual data
    outside of core systems may lead to inconsistencies.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value always guarantees a visible
    effect; some spell visuals might be hidden or overridden by other game mechanics.
    Additionally, this method does not validate whether the returned ID corresponds
    to an existing visual in the client database.
