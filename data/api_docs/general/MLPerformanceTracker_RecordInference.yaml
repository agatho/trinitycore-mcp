  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: RecordInference
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordInference(uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t
    durationUs)
documentation:
  brief: Records the duration of an AI inference operation for a specific bot.
  description: The RecordInference method logs the time taken to complete a machine
    learning inference task for a given bot identified by its GUID. This tracking
    mechanism is used to monitor performance metrics and optimize AI behavior in the
    game environment. The method stores the inference duration in microseconds, allowing
    for precise measurement of processing time. It's typically called after an AI
    decision-making process has completed, enabling developers to analyze how long
    various bot behaviors take to execute and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the inference duration
      is being recorded. This value uniquely identifies a specific game entity in
      the TrinityCore system.
  - name: durationUs
    description: The duration of the inference operation in microseconds. This represents
      the time elapsed between the start and end of the AI processing task.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t inferenceDuration = 45000; // 45 milliseconds

      tracker.RecordInference(botGuid, inferenceDuration);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Processing Loop
    code: "void BotAI::ProcessDecision()\n{\n    auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // ... AI inference logic here ...\n    auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(endTime\
      \ - startTime).count();\n    \n    MLPerformanceTracker::Instance()->RecordInference(GetGUID(),\
      \ duration.count());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within AI processing threads and
    should not be used for real-time performance monitoring due to potential locking
    mechanisms. The implementation likely uses thread-safe data structures internally
    to handle concurrent access from multiple bots. Performance tracking data may
    be aggregated or exported periodically for analysis.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid values are valid and correspond to existing bots in
    the game world, as invalid GUIDs might cause unexpected behavior or errors in
    the performance tracking system. Avoid calling this method too frequently in tight
    loops as it could impact overall system performance due to potential synchronization
    overhead.
