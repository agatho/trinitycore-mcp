  signature: void Group::ChangeLeader(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the group leader to the player with the specified GUID
  description: The ChangeLeader method transfers leadership of the group to another
    player identified by their GUID. This operation updates the group's leader information
    and broadcasts the change to all group members. The method typically requires
    the calling player to be the current leader or have appropriate permissions. When
    executed, it will invalidate the previous leader's authority and grant it to the
    new leader. This is commonly used during group reorganization, player disconnection
    scenarios, or when assigning leadership for specific activities.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become the new
      group leader. Must correspond to a valid online player in the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Transfer leadership to another player
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n    group->ChangeLeader(12345); // Transfer leadership to player with GUID\
      \ 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Ensure valid target before changing leader
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n    Player* newLeader = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 67890));\n    if (newLeader && group->IsMember(newLeader->GetGUID())) {\n\
      \        group->ChangeLeader(newLeader->GetGUID());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the necessary updates to group data structures
    and sends leader change notifications to all group members. It does not validate
    whether the target player is online or in the same map, so callers should ensure
    the player is a valid group member before calling. The operation is immediate
    and affects all group members synchronously.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group where the current player is not the leader
    will likely result in no change or an error condition. Ensure that only authorized
    players (typically the current leader) invoke this method to prevent unauthorized
    leadership changes. Do not call this method with invalid GUIDs as it may cause
    undefined behavior.
