documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the BotAI instance associated with the behavior manager for controlling
    bot AI behavior.
  description: The GetAI method returns a pointer to the BotAI object that manages
    the artificial intelligence behavior of a specific bot within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method provides access to the core AI system that controls how
    the bot interacts with the game world, including movement, combat decisions, and
    quest handling. The returned BotAI instance is typically initialized during the
    bot's creation and remains valid throughout its lifetime. This method serves as
    a central access point for retrieving the AI context needed to perform various
    bot-related operations such as command execution, state management, and behavior
    modification.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotAI object that controls the bot's artificial intelligence
    behavior. Returns nullptr if no AI instance is associated with the behavior manager
    or if the bot has not been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Access
    code: "BotAI* ai = behaviorManager->GetAI();\nif (ai != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ the AI instance for bot control\n    ai->UpdateAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe AI Usage with Null Check
    code: "BotAI* ai = behaviorManager->GetAI();\nif (ai != nullptr && ai->IsAlive())\n\
      {\n    // Perform actions only if bot is alive and AI is valid\n    ai->SetTarget(player);\n\
      \    ai->MoveTo(player->GetPosition());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned BotAI pointer should be used with caution as it represents a
    direct reference to the internal AI state. The behavior manager maintains ownership
    of the BotAI instance, so developers should not attempt to delete or manage its
    lifetime directly. This method is typically called during bot update cycles or
    when specific AI operations need to be performed.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned BotAI pointer will always be valid. Always
    check for null before using the returned pointer to prevent segmentation faults.
    The AI instance may become invalid if the bot is destroyed or if the behavior
    manager has not been properly initialized with an AI component.
