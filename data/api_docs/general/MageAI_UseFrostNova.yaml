documentation:
  brief: Casts the Frost Nova spell for the Mage AI unit.
  description: The UseFrostNova method triggers the casting of the Frost Nova spell
    within the Mage AI behavior system. This method is typically invoked when the
    AI determines that casting Frost Nova would be strategically beneficial, such
    as when enemies are within range or when the mage's mana allows for the spell's
    execution. The method handles the necessary checks and execution flow to ensure
    proper spell usage according to the Mage's AI logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsWithinMeleeRange(victim))\n\
      \    {\n        UseFrostNova();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI unit is a valid Mage class
    and has sufficient mana to cast Frost Nova. The spell's cooldown and range checks
    are handled internally by the AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the target environment allows for spell casting, as calling
    this method in inappropriate contexts (e.g., during movement or while stunned)
    may result in unexpected behavior or failure to cast.
