  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckMasterLooterChange
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckMasterLooterChange(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the master looter for a group based on current loot rules and player
    eligibility.
  description: The CheckMasterLooterChange method evaluates the current state of a
    group's loot distribution to determine if the master looter should be updated.
    It considers factors such as player roles, loot settings, and group composition
    to ensure proper loot assignment. This method is typically invoked during group
    updates or when loot is awarded to maintain fairness and adherence to World of
    Warcraft's loot rules within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group whose master
      looter needs to be evaluated.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState structure containing current group state
      information including loot settings and player eligibility.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group update context
    code: "void OnGroupUpdate(Group* group, GroupState& state)\n{\n    PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckMasterLooterChange(group,\
      \ state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot distribution logic
    code: "void HandleLootDistribution(Group* group, GroupState& state)\n{\n    //\
      \ Perform loot distribution logic\n    CheckMasterLooterChange(group, state);\n\
      \    // Continue with loot assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot AI system and should only be called
    when group state changes occur. It does not directly modify the group's master
    looter but updates internal state that may trigger a change in subsequent operations.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid and non-null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes. This method is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework and should not be called manually unless implementing
    custom group logic.
