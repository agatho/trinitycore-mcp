  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::HasSpell(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the combat specialization has a specific spell.
  description: The HasSpell method determines whether a given spell ID is associated
    with the combat specialization. This functionality is typically used to verify
    if a player's current specialization includes a particular ability or spell. The
    method performs a lookup within the specialization's internal spell list and returns
    true if the spell is found, otherwise false. This check is commonly used in spell
    validation, ability availability checks, and gameplay logic that depends on specialization-specific
    abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat specialization includes the specified spell
    ID; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Check
    code: "if (combatSpec->HasSpell(12345)) {\n    // Spell is available in this specialization\n\
      \    printf(\"Spell 12345 is part of this specialization\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage
    code: "uint32 spellId = 98765;\nif (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->HasSpell(spellId))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ spellId, true);\n} else {\n    // Handle case where spell is not available\n\
      \    player->SendSystemMessage(\"This ability is not available in your current\
      \ specialization.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a lookup operation which may involve iterating through
    an internal list of spells. For performance-critical code paths, consider caching
    results or using alternative data structures if frequent checks are required.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell in the game database. Invalid spell IDs may lead to unexpected
    behavior or false negatives.
