  class: Player
  method: SetHeirloomFlags
  signature: void Player::SetHeirloomFlags(uint32 slot, uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the heirloom flags for a specified slot in the player's inventory.
  description: This method allows developers to set or modify the heirloom flags associated
    with a specific inventory slot. Heirloom flags control whether an item is considered
    an heirloom, which affects its behavior and appearance in-game. The method operates
    on the player's inventory system and modifies the flags stored in the item's data
    field. This functionality is commonly used for managing heirloom-related gameplay
    mechanics, such as enabling or disabling specific heirloom features.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The inventory slot index where the heirloom flags should be applied.
      Valid values are typically 0-18, representing different equipment slots.
  - name: flags
    description: The flags value to set for the specified slot. This represents the
      bitmask of heirloom-related properties that determine how the item behaves in-game.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetHeirloomFlags(15, 0x01);

      // Sets the heirloom flag for slot 15 to enable specific heirloom behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's inventory management system and directly
    affects how heirloom items are processed in-game. The flags parameter is typically
    used to control the item's behavior rather than its visual appearance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect heirloom behavior or
    game mechanics issues. Ensure that the slot values correspond to valid inventory
    slots before applying flags.
