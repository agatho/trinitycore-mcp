  signature: void InventoryManager::RemoveIgnoredItem(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified item from the ignored list in the inventory manager.
  description: The RemoveIgnoredItem method removes a given item ID from the list
    of ignored items within the InventoryManager. This functionality is typically
    used to stop ignoring specific items, allowing them to be processed or displayed
    normally again. The method operates on the internal state of the InventoryManager
    and does not return any value. It assumes that the item ID provided is valid and
    exists in the ignored list, though it may silently fail if the item is not currently
    ignored.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to be removed from the ignored
      list. This must correspond to a valid item entry in the game's item database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove an Item from Ignore List
    code: 'InventoryManager* inventory = player->GetSession()->GetInventoryManager();

      inventory->RemoveIgnoredItem(12345); // Removes item with ID 12345 from ignored
      list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal tracking structures that maintain
    a set or list of ignored items. It's important to ensure that the item ID passed
    is valid to avoid unexpected behavior or silent failures.
