  signature: int FormationUtils::CalculateFlankingPositions(const int & enemyCenter,
    uint32 flankerCount)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates optimal flanking positions around an enemy center for formation-based
    AI behavior.
  description: 'The CalculateFlankingPositions method determines a set of strategic
    positioning points that flank an enemy''s central location. This utility is typically
    used in AI systems to compute where units should position themselves to effectively
    surround or attack an opponent. It takes into account the number of flanking units
    required and returns a configuration that maximizes tactical advantage. The method
    assumes a circular formation around the enemy center, distributing flanking positions
    evenly across the angular space. Precondition: enemyCenter must be a valid coordinate
    point; flankerCount should be a positive integer representing the number of units
    to position.'
  parameters:
  - name: enemyCenter
    description: The central coordinate point of the enemy unit or group. This serves
      as the reference point for calculating flanking positions.
  - name: flankerCount
    description: The number of units that will be positioned in a flanking formation
      around the enemy center. Must be a positive integer.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating success or failure of the calculation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful computation, while negative
    values may denote errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient space for
    positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int result = FormationUtils::CalculateFlankingPositions(100, 4);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Flanking positions calculated successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int result = FormationUtils::CalculateFlankingPositions(-1, 3);\nif (result\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Handle invalid enemy center coordinate\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI formation system and relies on internal game
    mechanics for spatial calculations. It may be used in conjunction with other formation
    utilities to build complex tactical behaviors. Performance is generally acceptable
    for small to medium-sized formations but could degrade with very large numbers
    of flanking units.
  warnings: Ensure that enemyCenter represents a valid coordinate within the game
    world; otherwise, behavior is undefined. The method does not validate whether
    the calculated positions are actually traversable or safe for unit movement.
