  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsWaterNode
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsWaterNode(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified node position is located within water terrain.
  description: The IsWaterNode method checks if a given node position in the game
    world is situated over water terrain. This functionality is crucial for pathfinding
    algorithms to determine valid movement paths, especially for aquatic creatures
    or when avoiding water obstacles. The method evaluates the terrain type at the
    specified position and returns true if the node is located on water, false otherwise.
    It's commonly used by AI systems to make decisions about movement behavior based
    on environmental conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The node position to check, represented as an integer identifier
      or coordinate value that uniquely identifies a point in the game world's navigation
      mesh.
  returns: Returns true if the specified node position is located over water terrain;
    otherwise returns false if the position is on solid ground or another non-water
    terrain type.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Node is Water
    code: "if (pathfindingManager.IsWaterNode(nodePosition)) {\n    // Handle movement\
      \ logic for water traversal\n    printf(\"Node is over water\\n\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with normal ground movement\n    printf(\"Node is on solid\
      \ ground\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal navigation mesh data structures and terrain
    lookup tables. Performance may be impacted when checking many nodes in succession,
    so caching results where possible is recommended for frequent checks.
  warnings: The method assumes that the input position parameter corresponds to a
    valid node in the pathfinding system. Invalid or out-of-bounds positions could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
