  class: InteractionRequirement
  method: CheckRequirements
  signature: bool InteractionRequirement::CheckRequirements(::Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets all interaction requirements for an object or quest.
  description: The CheckRequirements method evaluates whether a given player has satisfied
    all necessary conditions to interact with a specific game object, quest, or other
    interactive element. This includes checking for required level, quest completion
    status, item possession, faction standing, and any other defined prerequisites.
    The method returns true if all requirements are met, allowing interaction, or
    false if any requirement fails, preventing the interaction from proceeding. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining game logic consistency in player-object
    interactions within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose interaction requirements are being
      validated. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if all interaction requirements are satisfied by the player,
    allowing interaction with the associated object or quest. Returns false if any
    requirement fails, blocking the interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Requirement Check
    code: "if (interactionReq.CheckRequirements(player)) {\n    // Player can interact\
      \ with the object\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You may proceed.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Player cannot interact due to unmet requirements\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest System
    code: "if (questRequirement && questRequirement->CheckRequirements(player)) {\n\
      \    // Player can accept or complete the quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent quest interaction\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quest requirements not met.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interaction systems
    such as quest tracking, object activation, and NPC dialogues. It's important to
    note that the method does not modify player state; it only evaluates current conditions.
    The implementation may involve database lookups or cached data depending on how
    requirements are defined.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Calling CheckRequirements with an invalid player reference will lead
    to a crash or undefined behavior. Additionally, this method should be called in
    appropriate contexts where interaction validation is needed, such as before allowing
    quest acceptance or object usage.
