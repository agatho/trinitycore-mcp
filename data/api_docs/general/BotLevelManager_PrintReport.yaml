documentation:
  brief: Prints a detailed report of bot leveling statistics and progress to the console
    or log.
  description: The PrintReport method outputs comprehensive information about the
    current state of bot leveling within the TrinityCore environment. This includes
    data such as total bots, their level distributions, experience points, and any
    relevant performance metrics. The method is typically used for debugging, monitoring,
    or administrative purposes to assess how effectively bots are progressing through
    levels. It does not modify any internal state but provides a read-only view of
    bot leveling activity. The output is formatted for clarity and can be useful in
    identifying issues with bot progression or resource allocation.

  notes: This method relies on internal tracking mechanisms within the BotLevelManager
    class. It may have performance implications if called frequently in high-traffic
    environments due to log output generation and data aggregation. The report includes
    only data that has been collected up to the point of invocation.
