  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: SelectCharacterFromAccounts
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::SelectCharacterFromAccounts(int accounts,
    size_t index, const int & request, int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a bot character from a specified number of accounts based on index
    and request parameters.
  description: The SelectCharacterFromAccounts method is responsible for choosing
    a specific bot character from a set of accounts. It takes into account the total
    number of accounts to consider, a zero-based index to determine which character
    to select, and a request identifier that may influence selection criteria. This
    method likely interacts with internal bot management systems to assign or retrieve
    characters for use in automated gameplay scenarios. The callback parameter suggests
    that this operation might be asynchronous or trigger an event upon completion.
    This functionality is essential for managing large-scale bot operations where
    multiple accounts need to be coordinated and their characters selected systematically.
  parameters:
  - name: accounts
    description: The total number of accounts from which to select a character. Must
      be a positive integer representing valid account count.
  - name: index
    description: Zero-based index indicating the position of the desired character
      within the accounts. Should be less than the number of accounts specified.
  - name: request
    description: Reference to an integer identifier that may specify the type or context
      of the character selection request. Value is typically used internally for routing
      or filtering purposes.
  - name: callback
    description: Integer value representing a callback function identifier or event
      handler. Used to notify completion or trigger subsequent actions after character
      selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Selection
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      selector.SelectCharacterFromAccounts(5, 2, request, 1001);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Selecting First Character Across Multiple Accounts
    code: 'int accounts = 10;

      size_t index = 0;

      int request = 42;

      int callback = 500;

      selector.SelectCharacterFromAccounts(accounts, index, request, callback);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve internal locking mechanisms or thread synchronization
    when accessing shared account data structures. The 'request' parameter could be
    used to differentiate between various bot operation types (e.g., PvP, PvE, questing).
    Ensure that the index does not exceed the bounds of available accounts to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid index (greater than or equal to accounts) will likely
    cause undefined behavior or runtime errors. The callback mechanism should be properly
    initialized to prevent crashes during asynchronous execution.
