  signature: const CellObjectGuids * ObjectMgr::GetCellPersonalObjectGuids(uint32
    mapid, int spawnMode, uint32 phaseId, uint32 cell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUIDs of personal objects within a specified cell for a given
    map, spawn mode, and phase.
  description: The GetCellPersonalObjectGuids method retrieves a collection of unique
    identifiers (GUIDs) associated with personal objects located in a specific cell
    on a given map. These objects are typically related to player-specific data or
    phased content. The method takes into account the map ID, spawn mode, phase ID,
    and cell identifier to determine which objects should be returned. It is primarily
    used by the core game systems to efficiently manage object visibility and loading
    based on player phases and locations. The returned CellObjectGuids structure contains
    lists of GUIDs for different object types (e.g., players, creatures, game objects)
    that are relevant to the specified cell and phase.
  parameters:
  - name: mapid
    description: The ID of the map where the cell is located. Must correspond to a
      valid map in the game world.
  - name: spawnMode
    description: The spawn mode indicating how objects should be handled (e.g., normal,
      heroic, etc.). This affects which objects are included in the result.
  - name: phaseId
    description: The phase ID that determines visibility of phased objects. Objects
      with different phase IDs may not be returned depending on current player phase.
  - name: cell_id
    description: The unique identifier for the cell within the specified map. Cells
      are used to organize world objects spatially for efficient loading and management.
  returns: A pointer to a CellObjectGuids structure containing lists of GUIDs for
    personal objects in the specified cell, or NULL if no such data exists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve personal object GUIDs for a specific cell
    code: "const CellObjectGuids* guidList = sObjectMgr->GetCellPersonalObjectGuids(0,\
      \ 0, 1, 12345);\nif (guidList)\n{\n    // Process the list of GUIDs\n    for\
      \ (auto& guid : guidList->players)\n        printf(\"Player GUID: %u\\n\", guid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal object management system and should be
    used carefully. The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the
    ObjectMgr instance and should not be stored or accessed beyond that scope. Performance
    may vary depending on the number of objects in the specified cell.
  warnings: Do not modify the contents of the returned CellObjectGuids structure as
    it's meant to be read-only. Accessing invalid map IDs, spawn modes, or phase IDs
    can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
