  class: WorldObject
  method: SummonCreatureGroup
  signature: void WorldObject::SummonCreatureGroup(uint8 group, int * list)
documentation:
  brief: Summons a group of creatures with specified parameters.
  description: The SummonCreatureGroup method allows a WorldObject to summon a predefined
    group of creatures based on a given group identifier and list of creature entries.
    This method is commonly used in scripted events or quest triggers where multiple
    creatures need to be summoned simultaneously. The method operates within the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, enabling developers to create dynamic
    creature summoning scenarios that can be controlled through various parameters
    including spawn positions, faction, and behavior settings.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which creature group to summon. This
      typically corresponds to a predefined set of creatures in the database.
  - name: list
    description: Pointer to an array of creature entry IDs that define which specific
      creatures to summon within the group. The list should contain valid creature
      IDs from the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Group Summoning Example
    code: 'WorldObject* pObject = new WorldObject;

      uint8 group = 1;

      int list[] = {1234, 5678, 9012};

      pObject->SummonCreatureGroup(group, list);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires that the WorldObject be a valid instance with proper
    access to creature summoning capabilities. Implementation details include handling
    of spawn positions and faction settings for summoned creatures. Performance considerations
    include potential delays in execution due to database queries or creature spawning.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where creatures are summoned
    without proper validation, as it may lead to invalid creature entries or memory
    issues. The list parameter must contain valid creature IDs; otherwise, the summoning
    process will fail or result in unexpected behavior.
