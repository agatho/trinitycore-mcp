documentation:
  brief: Activates a specified game event internally within the server.
  description: The StartInternalEvent method is responsible for initiating a game
    event identified by its unique event_id. This function typically handles the internal
    activation logic of game events, such as triggering associated quests, spawning
    creatures, or modifying game state. It's designed to be called from within the
    core server code and not directly from external modules. The method does not return
    any value and operates synchronously on the calling thread.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to start. This ID corresponds
      to entries defined in the game_event table within the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Starting a Game Event
    code: GameEventMgr::instance().StartInternalEvent(42);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended for internal use by the TrinityCore server and should
    not be called directly from scripts or addons. It assumes that the event has already
    been validated and registered in the system.
