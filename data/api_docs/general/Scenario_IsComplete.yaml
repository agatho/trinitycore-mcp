documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the scenario has been completed
  description: The IsComplete method checks if a scenario has reached its completion
    state. This method is typically used to verify if all objectives within a scenario
    have been fulfilled, or if the scenario's conditions for ending have been met.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, scenarios are structured events
    with specific goals that players must achieve. The return value indicates whether
    the scenario should be considered finished and no longer active. This method does
    not modify any internal state but provides a read-only view of the scenario's
    completion status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scenario is complete (all objectives met, conditions
    satisfied), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check scenario completion
    code: "if (scenario->IsComplete()) {\n    // Handle scenario completion logic\n\
      \    player->SendNotification(\"Scenario completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsComplete in a quest progression system
    code: "void CheckScenarioProgress(Player* player) {\n    Scenario* currentScenario\
      \ = player->GetScenario();\n    if (currentScenario && currentScenario->IsComplete())\
      \ {\n        // Award rewards and advance quest\n        player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD,\
      \ 1);\n        player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_ID_SCENARIO);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with scenario event handlers
    to determine when to trigger reward distribution or quest completion. The implementation
    likely checks internal flags or objective completion states without modifying
    them.
