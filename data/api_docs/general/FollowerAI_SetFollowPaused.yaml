  class: FollowerAI
  method: SetFollowPaused
  signature: void FollowerAI::SetFollowPaused(bool paused)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses or resumes the follower's movement and AI behavior.
  description: The SetFollowPaused method controls whether a follower creature's AI
    behavior is paused or resumed. When paused, the follower will stop moving and
    executing AI actions until resumed. This method is typically used during quest
    events, scripted sequences, or when the follower needs to be temporarily disabled
    from following the player. The pause state affects the follower's movement, combat
    behavior, and any ongoing AI routines such as target selection or spell casting.
  parameters:
  - name: paused
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to pause (true) or resume (false)
      the follower's AI behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Pause Follower During Quest Event
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (Creature*\
      \ follower = player->GetAnyFollower())\n    {\n        follower->GetAI()->SetFollowPaused(true);\n\
      \        // Perform quest-specific actions\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resume Follower After Scripted Sequence
    code: "void OnScriptEnd()\n{\n    for (auto& follower : player->GetFollowers())\n\
      \    {\n        if (follower->HasUnitFlag(UNIT_FLAG_PASSENGER))\n        {\n\
      \            follower->GetAI()->SetFollowPaused(false);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the FollowerAI instance and affects
    the creature's behavior immediately. The pause state persists until explicitly
    changed by calling SetFollowPaused with a different value.
