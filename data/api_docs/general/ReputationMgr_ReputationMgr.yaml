documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ReputationMgr instance for the specified player.
  description: The ReputationMgr constructor initializes the reputation management
    system for a given player. This method sets up internal data structures and prepares
    the object to track and manage the player's reputation with various factions in
    the game. It is typically called during player creation or loading, establishing
    the foundation for all subsequent reputation-related operations such as gaining
    or losing reputation points, checking faction status, and determining available
    quest rewards based on reputation levels.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a ReputationMgr instance for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is already created

      ReputationMgr* repMgr = new ReputationMgr(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per player instance. The ReputationMgr
    object manages faction reputation data internally and requires the owner Player
    pointer to be valid throughout its lifetime.
