  brief: Applies healing effect to target units within the spell's range
  description: The EffectHeal method handles the application of healing effects for
    spells that cause healing to occur. This method is typically invoked during spell
    execution when a spell's effect involves healing targets, such as in the case
    of direct healing spells or periodic healing effects. It processes the healing
    calculations and applies the healing to target units based on the spell's parameters
    and modifiers. The method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's spell
    system and can be part of various spell mechanics including direct healing, periodic
    healing, or healing over time effects.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Spell Application
    code: "void Spell::EffectHeal() {\n    // Implementation would handle healing\
      \ application\n    // This method is called when a spell's healing effect needs\
      \ to be processed\n    // The actual implementation depends on the specific\
      \ spell being executed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell handling system and typically called
    by the spell's main execution logic. It may involve complex calculations including
    critical hit chance, healing modifiers, and target selection. Performance considerations
    include potential for multiple targets and different healing types.
  warnings: The method should not be directly invoked by external code without proper
    context. Spell effects are usually handled through the spell system and not directly
    by calling this method. Incorrect usage can lead to incorrect healing application
    or unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
