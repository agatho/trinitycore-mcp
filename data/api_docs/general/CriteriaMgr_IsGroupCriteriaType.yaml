documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified criteria type is a group-based criteria
    type.
  description: The IsGroupCriteriaType method checks if a given criteria type represents
    a group-based achievement or criterion. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    certain achievements are designed to be tracked for groups of players rather than
    individual players. This method helps identify such group criteria types, which
    can affect how progress is recorded and awarded within the game's achievement
    system. The method typically performs a lookup against an internal mapping or
    enumeration of criteria types to determine their grouping behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified criteria type is a group-based criteria type;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Criteria Type is Group-Based
    code: "if (criteriaMgr->IsGroupCriteriaType(123)) {\n    // Handle group-based\
      \ criteria logic\n    printf(\"This criteria type is group-based.\\n\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle individual-based criteria logic\n    printf(\"This criteria\
      \ type is not group-based.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal constants or a lookup table that maps
    criteria types to their grouping behavior. It may be used during achievement evaluation
    or progress tracking when determining whether to apply criteria to individual
    players or groups.
