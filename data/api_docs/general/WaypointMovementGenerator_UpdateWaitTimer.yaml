  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::UpdateWaitTimer(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the waypoint wait timer and returns true if the wait time has elapsed.
  description: The UpdateWaitTimer method is responsible for managing the timing logic
    associated with a waypoint in a movement generator. It takes a time delta (diff)
    representing the milliseconds that have passed since the last update, and decrements
    an internal wait timer. When the timer reaches zero, it indicates that the creature
    or unit has finished waiting at the current waypoint and can proceed to the next
    one. This method is typically called during the creature's AI update cycle to
    control movement pacing and timing between waypoints. The method returns true
    when the wait time has fully elapsed, signaling that the next waypoint should
    be processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true when the wait timer has completed and the unit can proceed
    to the next waypoint; otherwise returns false if the unit is still waiting at
    the current waypoint.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (m_waypointGenerator && m_waypointGenerator->UpdateWaitTimer(diff))\
      \ {\n            // Proceed to next waypoint\n            MoveToNextWaypoint();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement generator system and should only be called
    during AI update cycles. The internal timer state is managed automatically by
    the movement generator, but direct manipulation of the wait timer outside of this
    method is not recommended.
