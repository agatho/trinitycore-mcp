  method: NotifyEventHandlers
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::NotifyEventHandlers(const LifecycleEventInfo &
    eventInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all registered event handlers of a lifecycle event with the provided
    event information.
  description: The NotifyEventHandlers method is responsible for broadcasting a lifecycle
    event to all registered event handlers within the BotLifecycleMgr. It takes a
    LifecycleEventInfo object containing details about the event and ensures that
    all interested components are informed. This mechanism allows for decoupled communication
    between different parts of the bot system, enabling modular extensions and custom
    behaviors. The method does not return any value but serves as a central point
    for event propagation in the bot lifecycle management system.
  parameters:
  - name: eventInfo
    description: A constant reference to a LifecycleEventInfo object containing the
      details of the lifecycle event that needs to be broadcasted to all registered
      handlers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of NotifyEventHandlers
    code: 'LifecycleEventInfo event;

      event.eventType = BOT_EVENT_TYPE_CREATED;

      event.botId = 12345;

      botLifecycleMgr->NotifyEventHandlers(event);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a custom lifecycle event
    code: 'LifecycleEventInfo customEvent;

      customEvent.eventType = BOT_EVENT_TYPE_CUSTOM;

      customEvent.botId = 67890;

      customEvent.data = "Custom data for handler";

      botLifecycleMgr->NotifyEventHandlers(customEvent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the BotLifecycleMgr when a
    lifecycle event occurs. It assumes that all event handlers have been properly
    registered before this method is invoked. The method performs no locking or synchronization
    itself, so thread safety depends on how the registration and invocation are managed.
  warnings: Ensure that all event handlers are registered before calling this method
    to avoid missing events. Improper handling of event data can lead to unexpected
    behavior in bot modules that depend on these notifications.
