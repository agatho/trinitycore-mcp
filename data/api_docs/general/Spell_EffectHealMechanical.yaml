  brief: Applies mechanical healing effect to target units within spell range
  description: This method implements the mechanical healing effect for spells, which
    applies healing to targets based on mechanical damage dealt. The function handles
    the specific mechanics of how mechanical healing is processed and applied to affected
    targets. It typically involves calculating healing amounts based on the spell's
    base healing value and applying it to targets within the spell's range. This method
    is part of the core spell handling system in TrinityCore and operates within the
    context of game mechanics for healing spells.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectHealMechanical();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of target selection, healing calculation,
    and application of mechanical healing effects. Performance considerations involve
    proper handling of multiple targets in the spell's range. Thread safety is ensured
    through proper synchronization mechanisms.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper spell initialization.
    The method requires valid spell context to function correctly.
