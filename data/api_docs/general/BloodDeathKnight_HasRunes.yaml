  signature: bool BloodDeathKnight::HasRunes(uint32 blood, uint32 frost, uint32 unholy)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Blood Death Knight has sufficient runes of specified types.
  description: The HasRunes method determines whether a Blood Death Knight possesses
    at least the specified number of blood, frost, and unholy runes. This method is
    typically used during spell casting or ability usage to verify that the player
    has enough resource points to perform an action. It evaluates the current rune
    counts for each type and returns true only if all specified rune requirements
    are met. The method does not modify any internal state and serves purely as a
    query function for rune availability.
  parameters:
  - name: blood
    description: The required number of blood runes needed for the check
  - name: frost
    description: The required number of frost runes needed for the check
  - name: unholy
    description: The required number of unholy runes needed for the check
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight has at least the specified number of blood,
    frost, and unholy runes; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune availability check
    code: "if (deathKnight->HasRunes(1, 1, 1)) {\n    // Cast a spell requiring one\
      \ rune of each type\n    deathKnight->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_COIL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for multiple runes before using ability
    code: "if (deathKnight->HasRunes(2, 0, 1)) {\n    // Use a powerful ability requiring\
      \ 2 blood and 1 unholy runes\n    deathKnight->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BLOOD_BOIL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough runes, handle accordingly\n    deathKnight->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough runes!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with rune regeneration mechanics.
    The Death Knight's rune system in World of Warcraft operates on a 6-rune model
    (2 blood, 2 frost, 2 unholy) that regenerate over time. This function provides
    a quick way to validate resource availability without modifying the rune counts.
  warnings: This method does not account for rune cooldowns or temporary restrictions;
    it only checks current rune availability. It may return false even if runes are
    available but on cooldown, which could lead to incorrect spell casting decisions
    in certain situations.
