documentation:
  brief: Sets the respawn time for a game object, determining when it will reappear
    in the world.
  description: This method configures the respawn time for a GameObject instance,
    which controls when the object will reappear in the world after being destroyed
    or despawned. The respawn time is specified in seconds relative to the current
    server time. This method is commonly used during game object initialization or
    when modifying the behavior of dynamic game objects such as doors, chests, or
    other interactive elements. The value is typically set based on the object's type
    and the specific game mechanics required for proper gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: respawn
    description: The respawn time in seconds relative to current server time. A negative
      value indicates immediate respawn, while positive values indicate delay before
      respawn.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting immediate respawn
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetRespawnTime(-1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting delayed respawn
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetRespawnTime(300); // 5 minutes delay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the object's respawn behavior and should be
    used carefully during object initialization or modification. The respawn time
    is stored in the game object's internal data structure and will influence how
    often the object appears in the world after being destroyed.
  warnings: Setting a negative respawn time may cause immediate respawn, which could
    lead to performance issues if not handled properly. Care should be taken when
    setting respawn times for objects that are frequently interacted with or used
    in gameplay mechanics requiring precise timing.
