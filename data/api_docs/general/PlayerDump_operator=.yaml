  brief: Moves the contents of another PlayerDump object to this instance
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the PlayerDump
    class, transferring all resources and data from the source PlayerDump object to
    the current object. This is a move assignment operator that efficiently transfers
    ownership of dynamically allocated memory or other resources without performing
    deep copies. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the operation. This method is typically used when you want to efficiently transfer
    the contents of one PlayerDump instance to another, particularly in scenarios
    involving temporary objects or std::move operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current PlayerDump object (this) after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'PlayerDump dump1;

      PlayerDump dump2 = std::move(dump1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      PlayerDump dump3;

      dump3 = std::move(dump1); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<PlayerDump> dumps;

      PlayerDump tempDump;

      dumps.push_back(std::move(tempDump)); // Move assignment when adding to vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move assignment operator, not a copy assignment. It's designed
    for efficiency by transferring ownership rather than copying data. After the operation,
    the source object should not be used in a meaningful way as it may be left in
    a moved-from state. This method is part of the C++11 move semantics implementation
    and follows standard practices for move operations.
  warnings: Be careful when using this operator after moving from an object - the
    source object should not be accessed afterward as its state is undefined. Also,
    ensure that any resources managed by the PlayerDump class are properly handled
    during move operations to avoid resource leaks or double-free errors.
