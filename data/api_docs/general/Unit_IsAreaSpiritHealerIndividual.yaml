  signature: bool Unit::IsAreaSpiritHealerIndividual() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is an individual spirit healer.
  description: This method checks if the current unit is specifically an individual
    spirit healer, which is a special type of NPC that provides spirit resurrection
    services to players. In World of Warcraft, this typically applies to NPCs like
    the Spirit Healer in Darnassus or other locations where players can be resurrected.
    The method returns true when the unit is identified as such and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for determining proper interaction behavior with
    spirit healers during quest progression and resurrection mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is an individual spirit healer, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the unit can provide spirit resurrection services to players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsAreaSpiritHealerIndividual()) {\n    // Handle spirit resurrection\
      \ interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other unit checking methods
    to determine proper NPC interaction behavior. It's important to note that this
    method may be used in combination with IsAreaSpiritHealer to check for broader
    spirit healer functionality.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with IsAreaSpiritHealer, which checks
    for general spirit healer functionality rather than individual spirit healer status.
    Using the wrong method can lead to incorrect interaction behavior.
