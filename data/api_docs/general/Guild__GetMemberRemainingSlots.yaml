  class: Guild

  signature: int32 Guild::_GetMemberRemainingSlots(const Member & member, uint8 tabId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the remaining slot capacity for a guild member in a specific tab
    of the guild's inventory.
  description: The _GetMemberRemainingSlots method determines how many additional
    items can be placed into a specified guild bank tab by a given member. This calculation
    takes into account the member's permissions and the current item count within
    the tab. The method is used internally to enforce guild bank slot limitations
    and access controls. It returns a negative value if the member does not have sufficient
    permissions to deposit items in the specified tab, or zero if no more items can
    be added due to capacity limits.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Reference to the guild member whose remaining slot capacity is being
      calculated. This parameter determines the member's access level and permissions
      for the specified tab.
  - name: tabId
    description: Identifier of the guild bank tab for which to calculate remaining
      slots. Valid values are typically 0-6, corresponding to the standard guild bank
      tabs (0 being the first tab).
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the number of additional items that can be
    deposited into the specified tab by the member. A positive value indicates available
    slots, zero means no more items can be added, and a negative value typically indicates
    insufficient permissions or invalid tab ID.
  examples:
  - title: Check remaining slots for a guild member in tab 0
    code: "int32 remainingSlots = guild->_GetMemberRemainingSlots(member, 0);\nif\
      \ (remainingSlots > 0) {\n    // Member can deposit items\n} else if (remainingSlots\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Tab is full\n} else {\n    // Insufficient permissions or\
      \ invalid tab\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine if a member can add an item to a guild bank tab
    code: "uint8 tabIndex = 2;\nint32 slotsAvailable = guild->_GetMemberRemainingSlots(member,\
      \ tabIndex);\nif (slotsAvailable >= 1) {\n    // Proceed with depositing one\
      \ item\n    guild->DepositItem(tabIndex, item);\n} else if (slotsAvailable <\
      \ 0) {\n    // Handle insufficient permissions\n    SendGuildBankPermissionError(member,\
      \ tabIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during guild bank operations to validate
    whether a member can deposit items. It does not directly modify any state; it
    only performs calculations based on existing data. The implementation likely checks
    the member's rank permissions and compares against the tab's current item count
    versus its maximum capacity.
  warnings: Ensure that the tabId parameter is within valid range (typically 0-6)
    to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect results. This method may return negative
    values for permission-related errors, so callers should handle these cases appropriately
    to prevent unexpected program flow.
