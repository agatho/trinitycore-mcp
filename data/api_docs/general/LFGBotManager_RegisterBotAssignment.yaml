  method: RegisterBotAssignment
  signature: void LFGBotManager::RegisterBotAssignment(int humanGuid, int botGuid,
    uint8 role, const int & dungeons)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a bot assignment for a human player in a specific dungeon role.
  description: The RegisterBotAssignment method associates a human player GUID with
    a bot GUID and assigns them to a specific dungeon role. This functionality is
    typically used in LFG (Looking For Group) systems to manage automated bot participation
    in dungeons. The method stores the relationship between the human player, the
    assigned bot, and their designated role within the group. It's designed to support
    the integration of AI-controlled bots into player groups for dungeon finding and
    completion.
  parameters:
  - name: humanGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the human player who will be paired
      with a bot. This should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will be assigned to
      assist the human player. This represents an AI-controlled character.
  - name: role
    description: The role that the bot will assume within the group, typically represented
      as a uint8 value. Common roles include tank, healer, and damage dealer (DPS).
  - name: dungeons
    description: A reference to an integer representing the dungeon or instance ID
      where this bot assignment is applicable. This may be used for filtering or tracking
      purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Assignment Registration
    code: LFGBotManager::instance()->RegisterBotAssignment(12345, 67890, 1, 1001);
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning a Healing Bot to a Player
    code: 'int playerGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      int botGuid = bot->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint8 role = 2; // Assuming 2 represents healer role

      int dungeonId = 1002;

      LFGBotManager::instance()->RegisterBotAssignment(playerGuid, botGuid, role,
      dungeonId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal LFG data structures to maintain
    group composition and ensure proper bot behavior. The 'dungeons' parameter may
    be used for tracking which instances are eligible for bot assignment or for logging
    purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that both humanGuid and botGuid are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid GUIDs could cause unexpected behavior in the LFG system. Also, make
    sure that the role value is within expected bounds to prevent incorrect group
    dynamics.
