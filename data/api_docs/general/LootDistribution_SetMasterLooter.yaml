  class: LootDistribution
  method: SetMasterLooter
  signature: void LootDistribution::SetMasterLooter(Group * group, Player * masterLooter)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a player as the master looter for a group's loot distribution.
  description: The SetMasterLooter method designates a specific player as the master
    looter within a group context. This player will be responsible for distributing
    loot according to the group's loot rules, such as round-robin or free-for-all.
    The method updates internal state to reflect the new master looter, ensuring that
    subsequent loot distribution operations are handled by the designated player.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining organized and fair loot allocation
    in World of Warcraft groups.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the master looter is being
      set. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: masterLooter
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will become the new master looter.
      The player must be a member of the specified group and must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Master Looter in a Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nPlayer* newMasterLooter = GetPlayerByName(\"\
      LootMaster\");\nif (group && newMasterLooter && group->IsMember(newMasterLooter->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n    lootDistribution.SetMasterLooter(group, newMasterLooter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on whether the player is eligible
    to be a master looter (e.g., level requirements). It simply assigns the role without
    checking if the player meets game rules or permissions. The internal state of
    the loot distribution system will be updated immediately upon calling this function.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid and non-null before calling this
    method, as passing invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior. Also note
    that changing the master looter does not automatically redistribute already rolled
    loot; it only affects future loot distributions.
