documentation:
  brief: Updates the defensive abilities and cooldowns of the fire mage based on current
    game state and spell availability.
  description: The UpdateDefensives method is responsible for managing and updating
    the defensive capabilities of a Fire Mage character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This includes checking the status of defensive spells such as Ice Barrier, Frost
    Armor, or any other defensive cooldowns that the mage might have available. The
    method evaluates the current combat situation, player health, mana levels, and
    spell cooldowns to determine which defensive abilities should be activated or
    refreshed. It ensures that the fire mage maintains optimal defensive posture during
    encounters by intelligently managing these abilities in response to changing battlefield
    conditions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void FireMageAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_mage->UpdateDefensives();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void FireMageRefactored::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Initialize defensive\
      \ cooldowns\n    UpdateDefensives();\n}\n\nvoid FireMageRefactored::OnDamageTaken(uint32\
      \ damage)\n{\n    // Reassess defenses after taking damage\n    UpdateDefensives();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure defensive
    abilities are properly managed. It is typically invoked from the AI update loop
    or when significant combat events occur such as taking damage or entering combat.
  warnings: Ensure that this method does not cause infinite loops or excessive spell
    casting by checking cooldowns and conditions before attempting to cast defensive
    spells. The method may be called frequently during combat, so performance considerations
    are important.
