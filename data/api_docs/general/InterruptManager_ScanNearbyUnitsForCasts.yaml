  class: InterruptManager
  method: ScanNearbyUnitsForCasts
  signature: void InterruptManager::ScanNearbyUnitsForCasts()
documentation:
  brief: Scans nearby units for ongoing casts and interrupts them if applicable.
  description: The ScanNearbyUnitsForCasts method iterates through all units within
    a specified range of the owner (typically an AI-controlled creature or player),
    checking whether any of these units are currently casting spells. If a cast is
    detected, the method evaluates if the cast should be interrupted based on predefined
    conditions such as damage taken, proximity to the caster, or specific interrupt
    rules. This functionality is commonly used in AI systems to prevent enemies from
    completing dangerous or undesirable spell casts during combat.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EnemyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_canInterrupt)\n     \
      \   m_interruptManager.ScanNearbyUnitsForCasts();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically operates within a game tick or update loop and may
    involve performance considerations when scanning large numbers of units. It is
    often called at regular intervals to ensure timely interruption of spells.
  warnings: Ensure that the scan range and frequency are tuned appropriately to avoid
    excessive CPU usage, especially in high-density combat scenarios with many nearby
    units.
