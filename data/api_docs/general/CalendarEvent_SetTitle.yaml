  class: CalendarEvent

documentation:
  brief: Sets the title of the calendar event to the specified string value.
  description: The SetTitle method assigns a new title to a CalendarEvent object.
    This method is used to modify the display name of an event within the game's calendar
    system. The title is typically shown to players when viewing calendar events and
    can be used to communicate important information about the event such as its purpose,
    time, or location. The method does not perform any validation on the input string,
    so it's up to the caller to ensure the title is appropriate for display. This
    is a simple setter method that directly updates the internal title member variable
    of the CalendarEvent instance.
  parameters:
  - name: title
    description: The new title to assign to the calendar event. This should be a valid
      UTF-8 string that represents the name or description of the event. The string
      can contain any printable characters including spaces and special characters,
      but should be kept reasonable for display purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Event Title
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      std::string newTitle = "Guild Meeting - Weekly Raid Preparation";

      event.SetTitle(newTitle);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Event Title Dynamically
    code: "void UpdateEventTitle(CalendarEvent* calendarEvent, const std::string&\
      \ newEventName) {\n    if (calendarEvent != nullptr) {\n        calendarEvent->SetTitle(newEventName);\n\
      \    }\n}\n\n// Usage\nCalendarEvent myEvent;\nUpdateEventTitle(&myEvent, \"\
      Dragon Soul Raid - Boss 3 Strategy Discussion\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent object.
    It is recommended to ensure that the title string is properly sanitized before
    calling this method if it originates from user input to prevent display issues
    or potential security concerns. The method does not trigger any additional events
    or notifications in the game system.
  warnings: No specific warnings for this method. However, developers should be aware
    that setting an empty string or very long title may result in display truncation
    or rendering issues within the game client. It's recommended to validate input
    length and content before calling this method.
