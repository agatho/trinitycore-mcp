  method: ~ResourceMonitor
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::~ResourceMonitor()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ResourceMonitor instance and releases all associated system resources.
  description: The ResourceMonitor destructor is responsible for cleaning up all system
    resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the ResourceMonitor object.
    This includes releasing memory, closing file handles, and unregistering any callbacks
    or listeners that may have been set up. The destructor ensures proper cleanup
    when the ResourceMonitor instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    It is important to note that this method should not be called directly unless
    you are managing the object's lifetime manually, as it is typically invoked automatically
    by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ResourceMonitor instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ResourceMonitor monitor;\n    // ... use monitor\
      \ ...\n} // monitor's destructor called here automatically"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual deletion of ResourceMonitor pointer
    code: 'ResourceMonitor* monitor = new ResourceMonitor();

      // ... use monitor ...

      delete monitor; // Calls ~ResourceMonitor() explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is marked as virtual in the base class, indicating that it's
    designed to be part of a polymorphic hierarchy. This ensures proper cleanup when
    deleting objects through base class pointers. The ResourceMonitor may track system
    resources like memory usage, CPU load, or file handles, and its destructor ensures
    these are properly released.
  warnings: Never call this destructor directly unless you're implementing custom
    memory management. The destructor should only be invoked by the C++ runtime during
    normal object destruction. Calling it manually can lead to undefined behavior
    if the object has already been partially destroyed.
