    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a cosmetic mount aura effect on the target player.
  description: The HandleCosmeticMounted method is responsible for managing the application
    and removal of cosmetic mount auras in World of Warcraft. This method is typically
    invoked during aura application or removal events to update the visual state of
    a player's mount display. When applied, it may modify the player's model or display
    a mount effect without affecting movement mechanics. The method operates on the
    AuraApplication context and uses the mode parameter to determine whether to apply
    or remove the effect. It is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and
    interacts with the client-side visual rendering of mounts.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter provides context for which
      aura is triggering the mount effect.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect. Typically indicates whether
      the aura is being applied (1) or removed (0). This value determines how the
      cosmetic mount state should be updated.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the cosmetic mount effect. This parameter works in conjunction with the mode
      parameter to control the aura's behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleCosmeticMounted
    code: "void ApplyCosmeticMount(AuraApplication* aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply)\
      \ {\n    AuraEffect* effect = aurApp->GetBase()->GetEffect(0);\n    if (effect\
      \ && effect->GetAuraType() == SPELL_AURA_MOUNTED) {\n        effect->HandleCosmeticMounted(aurApp,\
      \ mode, apply);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal aura handling system and should not be
    called directly from outside the core aura application logic. The cosmetic mount
    effect only affects visual appearance and does not modify player movement or combat
    abilities. Implementation details may vary based on the specific spell or aura
    that triggers this handler.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could result in incorrect visual state updates
    for players, potentially causing client-side rendering issues or inconsistency
    between server and client states. Ensure that all parameters are properly validated
    before calling this method.
