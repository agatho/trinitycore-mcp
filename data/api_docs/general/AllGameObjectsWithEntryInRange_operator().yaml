documentation:
  brief: Checks if all game objects with a specific entry are within a given range.
  description: The AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange::operator() method is a predicate
    function used to evaluate whether all game objects of a specified entry type exist
    within a defined range. This method is typically employed in TrinityCore's object
    search and filtering mechanisms, particularly when iterating through nearby game
    objects to perform conditional checks or actions based on their presence. It serves
    as part of a larger system for managing and querying GameObjects in the World
    of Warcraft emulation environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all game objects with the specified entry are within range,
    otherwise returns false. The method acts as a boolean filter condition in traversal
    or search operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in GameObject Search
    code: "class MyGameObjectSearcher {\npublic:\n    bool operator()(int* go) const\
      \ {\n        // Assuming this is part of a larger search logic\n        return\
      \ AllGameObjectsWithEntryInRange(go);\n    }\n};\n\n// Usage example:\nMyGameObjectSearcher\
      \ searcher;\nbool allInRange = searcher(&gameObjectGuid);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's GameObject system
    for range-based queries. It may be part of a template or functor pattern that
    allows flexible filtering during object iteration. Developers should ensure proper
    initialization of the GameObject entry and range parameters before invoking this
    predicate.
