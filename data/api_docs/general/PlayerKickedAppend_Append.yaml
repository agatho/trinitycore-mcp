documentation:
  brief: Appends player kick notification data to a channel notify packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with player kick-related information. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to construct and send channel-related notifications
    to players when a user is kicked from a channel. The implementation likely sets
    appropriate fields in the notify packet such as the kick reason, kicker's name,
    and target player's name. This functionality is part of the core chat and channel
    management system in World of Warcraft emulation.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in channel kick handler
    code: 'PlayerKickedAppend kicker;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      kicker.Append(notifyPacket);

      // notifyPacket now contains the kick notification data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system and should
    only be called when constructing channel notification packets. The method modifies
    the provided packet in-place and does not return any value. It's designed to work
    within the TrinityCore packet handling architecture.
  warnings: Ensure that the ChannelNotify packet passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling Append, as the method may overwrite existing data.
    This method should only be used in contexts where channel kick notifications are
    being processed or generated.
