  brief: Updates the hunter's buffs and aura states based on current combat conditions
    and pet status.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method in HunterAI is responsible for managing and
    updating the hunter's active buffs and auras. This includes checking whether the
    hunter should apply or remove specific buff spells based on their current combat
    state, pet status, and environmental conditions. The method ensures that the hunter
    maintains optimal buffing behavior during both solo and group play scenarios.
    It typically runs periodically during the AI update cycle to maintain proper spell
    application and removal logic.

  notes: This method is typically called as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    may interact with pet state management. It's important to note that buff updates
    are conditional on various factors including combat status, pet presence, and
    spell cooldowns.
