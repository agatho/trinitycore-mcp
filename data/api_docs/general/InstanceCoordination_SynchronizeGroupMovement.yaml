  signature: void InstanceCoordination::SynchronizeGroupMovement(Group * group, const
    int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes movement coordination for all members of a group within an instance.
  description: The SynchronizeGroupMovement method ensures that all players in the
    specified group are synchronized with a common destination coordinate within the
    instance. This functionality is typically used during instance events, boss encounters,
    or scripted sequences where coordinated player movement is required. The method
    handles the distribution of movement commands to all group members and manages
    their positioning to maintain group cohesion. It's particularly important for
    maintaining proper game mechanics such as avoiding player desynchronization during
    combat or quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose movement
      needs synchronization. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: destination
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination coordinate or waypoint
      for group movement. The value typically corresponds to predefined locations
      within the instance map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Movement Synchronization
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::SynchronizeGroupMovement(playerGroup,\
      \ 1001);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Coordinated Movement During Boss Encounter
    code: "void OnBossEngage(Boss* boss)\n{\n    Group* raidGroup = boss->GetRaidGroup();\n\
      \    if (raidGroup)\n    {\n        InstanceCoordination::SynchronizeGroupMovement(raidGroup,\
      \ BOSS_ENGAGE_POSITION);\n        // Additional movement logic here\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates at the instance level and may involve network
    synchronization between server and client. It's designed to work with existing
    group management systems in TrinityCore and should be called during appropriate
    game state transitions. The destination parameter is expected to map to valid
    coordinates within the instance's coordinate system.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the destination value corresponds to an actual
    valid location within the instance. Improper use may result in players being teleported
    incorrectly or experiencing movement desynchronization.
