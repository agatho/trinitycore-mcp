  method: GetScript
  signature: SmartScript * SmartAI::GetScript()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the SmartScript instance associated with this SmartAI
    object
  description: The GetScript method retrieves and returns a pointer to the SmartScript
    object that is linked to the current SmartAI instance. This method serves as a
    getter for accessing the underlying script engine that controls AI behavior in
    TrinityCore. The returned SmartScript pointer allows access to various AI-related
    functionalities such as event handling, action execution, and condition checking.
    This method is typically used internally by the AI system but may also be accessed
    by custom scripts or modules that need to interact with the SmartScript engine
    directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the SmartScript object associated with this SmartAI instance,
    or nullptr if no script is currently assigned
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access SmartScript
    code: "SmartScript* script = ai->GetScript();\nif (script != nullptr)\n{\n   \
      \ // Use the script object for AI operations\n    script->ProcessEvents();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking script validity before usage
    code: "SmartAI* ai = (SmartAI*)creature->GetAI();\nSmartScript* script = ai->GetScript();\n\
      if (script != nullptr && script->IsInitialized())\n{\n    // Safe to perform\
      \ AI operations\n    script->SetGlobalCooldown(1000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of creature AI systems where
    SmartAI manages the behavior of game entities. The returned SmartScript pointer
    should be validated for null before use, as it may return nullptr if the AI has
    not been properly initialized or if no script is assigned to the entity.
  warnings: Never assume that the returned SmartScript pointer is valid without checking
    for null. Accessing a null pointer will result in a crash. Always verify the script's
    initialization state before performing operations on it.
