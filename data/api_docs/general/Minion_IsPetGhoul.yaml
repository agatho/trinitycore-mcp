documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a pet ghoul.
  description: The IsPetGhoul method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a pet ghoul, which is a specific type of creature summoned by certain spells or
    abilities in World of Warcraft. This includes ghouls created through the Ghoul
    Form spell or similar mechanics. The method returns true if the minion is indeed
    a pet ghoul, and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in AI logic
    to differentiate between regular minions and pet ghouls for special behavior handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a pet ghoul; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a minion is a pet ghoul
    code: "if (minion->IsPetGhoul()) {\n    // Handle pet ghoul specific behavior\n\
      \    DoGhoulSpecificAction();\n} else {\n    // Handle regular minion behavior\n\
      \    DoRegularMinionAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags or creature type checks within the TrinityCore
    framework. It's important to note that pet ghouls are typically created through
    specific spells like 'Raise Dead' or 'Ghoul Form', and this method helps distinguish
    them from other summoned creatures.
