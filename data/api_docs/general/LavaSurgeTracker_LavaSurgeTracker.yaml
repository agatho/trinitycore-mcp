  method: LavaSurgeTracker
  signature: void LavaSurgeTracker::LavaSurgeTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LavaSurgeTracker class for tracking Lava
    Surge spell effects.
  description: The LavaSurgeTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    LavaSurgeTracker class, which is responsible for managing and tracking the state
    of the Lava Surge talent effect in World of Warcraft. This tracker monitors when
    the Lava Surge buff is active on a player or creature, typically used by shaman
    classes to enhance their elemental spell damage. The constructor sets up internal
    data structures necessary for tracking the duration, effects, and cooldowns associated
    with the Lava Surge ability. It ensures that the tracker is properly initialized
    before being used in combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LavaSurgeTracker instance
    code: 'LavaSurgeTracker* tracker = new LavaSurgeTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track Lava Surge effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new instance of the
    tracker. It does not perform any validation or initialization of external dependencies.
    The tracker assumes that the underlying spell system and player state are properly
    configured before being used.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you are implementing a custom
    Lava Surge tracking system. In most cases, the tracker should be managed by the
    game's internal systems rather than manually instantiated.
