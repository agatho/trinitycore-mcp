documentation:
  brief: Establishes a link between the group reference and its target object.
  description: The targetObjectBuildLink method is responsible for creating or updating
    the association between a GroupReference object and its associated target object
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that the group reference
    maintains a valid connection to the target entity, typically used in group management
    systems where references need to be dynamically linked or re-established. The
    operation usually involves setting internal pointers or handles that allow the
    system to navigate from the group reference to its target object efficiently.
    This is particularly important in scenarios involving dynamic group membership
    changes, object destruction, or when restoring group state after serialization.

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: 'GroupReference* ref = new GroupReference();

      ref->targetObjectBuildLink();

      // The reference is now linked to its target object

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a group reference needs to be re-established
    with its target object, especially after deserialization or when objects are dynamically
    created. It's typically invoked internally by the framework but may also be called
    explicitly during specific group management operations.
  warnings: Calling this method on an improperly initialized GroupReference may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target object exists and is
    in a valid state before invoking this method.
