  class: LFGMgr
  method: SendLfgQueueStatus
  signature: void LFGMgr::SendLfgQueueStatus(int guid, const LfgQueueStatusData &
    data)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG queue status update to the specified player.
  description: The SendLfgQueueStatus method is responsible for transmitting the current
    state of a player's Looking For Group (LFG) queue to the client. This includes
    information about the player's position in the queue, expected wait time, and
    any relevant group matching details. The method is typically invoked by the LFG
    manager when there are changes to a player's queue status, such as when they join
    or leave a queue, or when a match is found. It ensures that players receive real-time
    updates about their LFG status and helps maintain synchronization between the
    server and client for group finding mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose queue status is
      being sent. This value identifies the specific client that will receive the
      update.
  - name: data
    description: An object containing the current LFG queue status information to
      be transmitted to the player. This includes details such as queue position,
      wait time estimates, and group matching data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Queue Status Update
    code: 'LfgQueueStatusData statusData;

      statusData.queuePosition = 5;

      statusData.waitTime = 120;

      statusData.groupMatch = false;


      // Send the queue status to player with GUID 12345

      sLFGMgr->SendLfgQueueStatus(12345, statusData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and relies on proper initialization
    of the LFG manager. The data parameter must be properly populated with valid queue
    status information before calling this method to avoid sending incorrect or incomplete
    information to players.
