documentation:
  brief: Called when a player enters a dungeon instance
  description: The OnDungeonEnter method is invoked when a player successfully enters
    a dungeon instance. This method serves as a callback for custom dungeon scripting
    logic, allowing developers to execute specific actions or modifications when players
    enter dungeon environments. The method provides access to both the player and
    instance data through integer pointers, enabling interaction with player and instance
    properties. It is typically used in custom dungeon scripts to initialize player
    states, apply buffs, trigger events, or modify game behavior upon dungeon entry.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player's identifier within the dungeon instance. This
      represents the player object that entered the dungeon.
  - name: instance
    description: Pointer to the instance data for the dungeon. This provides access
      to dungeon-specific information and state management.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Entry Script
    code: "class MyDungeonScript : public DungeonScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnDungeonEnter(int*\
      \ player, int* instance) override\n    {\n        // Apply a buff to the player\
      \ upon entering the dungeon\n        if (player && instance)\n        {\n  \
      \          // Example: Grant temporary health boost\n            // Player would\
      \ be accessed through *player\n            // Instance data through *instance\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp

    code: "class BossDungeonScript : public DungeonScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnDungeonEnter(int*\
      \ player, int* instance) override\n    {\n        if (!player || !instance)\n\
      \            return;\n        \n        // Initialize boss encounter state\n\
      \        // Store player in instance data\n        // Set up timers or event\
      \ triggers\n        // Log entry for tracking purposes\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore scripting system and is intended to
    be overridden by custom dungeon scripts. The integer pointers provided should
    not be directly dereferenced without proper validation, as they may point to invalid
    memory locations if not properly initialized. Consider using safe casting or validation
    checks before accessing player/instance data.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player or instance pointers can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Always validate pointer values before use and ensure that
    the dungeon script is properly registered with the TrinityCore server system.
