    proper resource allocation and authentication mechanisms. The method is read-only
    and does not modify any internal state. It's commonly used during initialization
    phases or configuration checks to validate that sufficient accounts exist for
    bot operations.

    bot functionality. This count includes all unique account identifiers necessary
    for the system to operate correctly.

  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or configuration validation
    to ensure that the number of configured accounts meets minimum requirements. The
