  class: LfgLockInfoData
  method: LfgLockInfoData
  signature: void LfgLockInfoData::LfgLockInfoData(uint32 _lockStatus, uint16 _requiredItemLevel,
    float _currentItemLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgLockInfoData object with specified lock status, required
    item level, and current item level.
  description: The LfgLockInfoData constructor initializes a data structure used in
    World of Warcraft's Looking for Group (LFG) system to manage lock information
    for dungeon entries. This method sets up internal state variables that represent
    the lock status of a group or player in an LFG context, including the required
    item level needed to join a specific dungeon and the current item level of the
    player attempting to join. The lock status typically indicates whether a player
    can join a group based on their item level requirements and other constraints.
    This initialization is crucial for maintaining proper LFG functionality and ensuring
    players meet the necessary criteria before being allowed into dungeons.
  parameters:
  - name: _lockStatus
    description: The lock status code indicating whether the player can join a group
      (0 = unlocked, non-zero = locked). Valid values are typically 0 for unlocked
      or specific error codes for different lock conditions.
  - name: _requiredItemLevel
    description: The minimum item level required to participate in the dungeon. This
      is usually derived from the dungeon's difficulty and requirements. Must be a
      positive integer value representing the item level threshold.
  - name: _currentItemLevel
    description: The current item level of the player attempting to join. This value
      is used to compare against the required item level to determine if the player
      meets the criteria. Should be a floating-point number representing the effective
      item level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize LfgLockInfoData for a player attempting to join a dungeon
    code: 'LfgLockInfoData lockData(0, 850, 845.5f);

      // Lock status = 0 (unlocked), Required item level = 850,

      // Current item level = 845.5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize LfgLockInfoData with locked status due to insufficient item
      level
    code: 'LfgLockInfoData lockData(1, 900, 875.0f);

      // Lock status = 1 (locked), Required item level = 900,

      // Current item level = 875.0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the LFG system's internal data management and
    should not be called directly by external code unless implementing custom LFG
    logic. The lock status codes are typically defined in the LFG system constants
    and may vary depending on specific game mechanics or expansions.
  warnings: Incorrect initialization values for item levels can cause unexpected behavior
    in LFG matching systems. Ensure that _requiredItemLevel is always greater than
    or equal to _currentItemLevel when creating locked states, otherwise it may lead
    to incorrect access control.
