  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: ConsumeProc
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::ConsumeProc(uint32 procId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a proc event by its ID, removing or deactivating the associated
    combat specialization effect.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is used to process and consume a proc event
    within the CombatSpecializationBase class. This method typically handles the logic
    for removing or disabling a proc that has been triggered, ensuring that it does
    not activate again. It is commonly used in conjunction with combat specializations
    that have proc-based effects, such as weapon enchantments or class abilities that
    trigger under specific conditions. The method takes a proc ID as input to identify
    which specific proc should be consumed and performs the necessary cleanup or state
    changes. This function plays a crucial role in maintaining proper proc cooldowns
    and preventing duplicate activations of specialization effects.
  parameters:
  - name: procId
    description: The unique identifier of the proc event to be consumed. This ID typically
      corresponds to a specific combat specialization effect or ability that has been
      triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Consumption
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec)\n{\n    spec->ConsumeProc(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Proc Consumption
    code: "if (player->HasAura(67890))\n{\n    CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\n\
      \    if (spec)\n    {\n        spec->ConsumeProc(67890);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the combat system when a proc
    effect has been successfully triggered and needs to be consumed. It's important
    to ensure that the proc ID passed to this method corresponds to an actual active
    proc in the specialization system. The method may perform internal state checks
    to verify that the proc exists before attempting to consume it.
  warnings: Calling ConsumeProc with an invalid or non-existent procId may result
    in undefined behavior or silent failures. Always verify that the proc is active
    before calling this method. Improper use can lead to proc duplication or incorrect
    cooldown handling.
