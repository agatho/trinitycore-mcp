  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: EnableAdaptiveBehavior
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::EnableAdaptiveBehavior(uint32 groupId, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables adaptive behavior for a specified dungeon group.
  description: The EnableAdaptiveBehavior method controls whether a dungeon group
    will dynamically adjust its behavior based on player performance and encounter
    conditions. This adaptive system can modify difficulty scaling, NPC AI responses,
    and loot distribution to provide a more engaging experience. The method takes
    a group identifier and a boolean flag to enable or disable the adaptive behavior
    for that specific group. When enabled, the dungeon behavior will monitor player
    actions and adjust accordingly during the encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the dungeon group to modify. This value typically
      corresponds to a specific instance or group within the dungeon system.
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      adaptive behavior for the specified group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Adaptive Behavior for Group
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeonBehavior = sObjectAccessor->GetDungeonBehavior();

      dungeonBehavior->EnableAdaptiveBehavior(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Adaptive Behavior for Group
    code: 'DungeonBehavior* dungeonBehavior = sObjectAccessor->GetDungeonBehavior();

      dungeonBehavior->EnableAdaptiveBehavior(67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with dungeon instance management
    and AI behavior systems. The adaptive behavior may require additional configuration
    or initialization before it becomes effective.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group that does not exist may result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure the groupId corresponds to an active dungeon group before calling
    this method.
