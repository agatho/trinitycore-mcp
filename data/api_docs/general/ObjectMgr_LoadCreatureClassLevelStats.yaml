documentation:
  brief: Loads creature class level statistics from the database into memory for use
    in game calculations.
  description: The LoadCreatureClassLevelStats method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with creature class level statistics stored in the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that all creature statistics are available for dynamic calculations
    during gameplay. It reads data from the creature_classlevelstats table and caches
    it for efficient access when creatures are spawned or their stats are calculated.
    The loaded data includes base health, mana, damage values, and other combat-related
    attributes that scale with creature level and class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureClassLevelStats();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the ObjectMgr initialization sequence. The loaded data is cached in memory
    and used for real-time creature stat calculations, so changes to the database
    require a reload of this data structure to take effect.
