  signature: bool Item::IsInUpdateQueue() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item is currently in the update queue for processing.
  description: This method checks if the item object is scheduled for updates within
    the game world's update system. It returns true when the item is pending updates,
    typically indicating that it has been modified and requires synchronization with
    clients or other systems. The method is commonly used in conjunction with the
    update queue management system to prevent race conditions during item modifications
    and ensure proper synchronization of item state changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is currently in the update queue, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the item has been modified and requires processing by the
    update system.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Item Update Status
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGuid(guid);\nif (item->IsInUpdateQueue())\
      \ {\n    // Item is pending updates\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's update system to
    manage item synchronization. It should not be called directly in most cases, as
    the update queue management is handled automatically during item modifications.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calls during high-frequency
    operations.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining item state in game logic,
    as it only indicates pending updates rather than actual item status. Use this
    method primarily for debugging or internal system tracking purposes.
