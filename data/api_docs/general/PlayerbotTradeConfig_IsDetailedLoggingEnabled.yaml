  method: IsDetailedLoggingEnabled
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsDetailedLoggingEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether detailed logging is enabled for player bot trading activities.
  description: The IsDetailedLoggingEnabled method checks the configuration state
    to determine if detailed logging is active for player bot trade operations. This
    functionality allows developers and administrators to enable or disable verbose
    logging of trade interactions, which can be useful for debugging, monitoring,
    or performance analysis purposes. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current logging status. This setting typically affects how trade-related events
    are recorded in the game's log system and may influence memory usage or performance
    during intensive trading scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if detailed logging for player bot trades is enabled; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Detailed Logging is Enabled
    code: "if (playerbotTradeConfig.IsDetailedLoggingEnabled()) {\n    // Perform\
      \ additional logging or debugging actions\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\", \"Detailed\
      \ trade logging is enabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a configuration file or runtime setting that
    controls logging verbosity. It's important to note that enabling detailed logging
    may impact performance in high-frequency trading scenarios due to increased I/O
    operations.
