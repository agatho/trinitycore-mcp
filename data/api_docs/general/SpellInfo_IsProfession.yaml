documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is a profession spell
  description: This method checks if the current spell is classified as a profession
    spell, which includes skills related to crafting, gathering, and other professional
    activities. Profession spells typically have specific properties that distinguish
    them from regular spells, such as being associated with specific skill lines or
    having unique mechanics like cooldowns or requirements for casting. The method
    returns true when the spell is recognized as a profession spell, indicating it
    belongs to a profession category rather than a general spell category.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is a profession spell, false otherwise. This
    indicates that the spell has profession-specific characteristics and can be used
    in context of professional skill systems.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a spell is a profession
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsProfession()) {\n    // Handle profession-specific logic\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on internal spell data structure and may involve checking
    against predefined profession spell IDs or categories. Performance impact is minimal
    as this is a simple boolean check.
