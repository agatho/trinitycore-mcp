  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: SetProcessingEnabled
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::SetProcessingEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables processing of bot spawn events in the event bus.
  description: The SetProcessingEnabled method controls whether the BotSpawnEventBus
    will process incoming bot spawn events. When enabled, the event bus will handle
    and dispatch bot spawn notifications to registered listeners. When disabled, all
    bot spawn events are ignored until re-enabled. This method is typically used to
    temporarily pause or resume bot spawn handling during server maintenance, debugging
    sessions, or when specific conditions require suspension of event processing.
    The state change is immediate and affects all subsequent events without requiring
    restart of the event bus.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      bot spawn event processing. True enables processing, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot Spawn Processing
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();

      eventBus->SetProcessingEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot Spawn Processing During Maintenance
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus* eventBus = BotSpawnEventBus::Instance();

      // Suspend processing during maintenance window

      eventBus->SetProcessingEnabled(false);

      // Perform maintenance tasks...

      // Resume processing after maintenance

      eventBus->SetProcessingEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a global singleton instance of BotSpawnEventBus.
    The enabled state is maintained internally and persists across multiple calls.
    No thread synchronization is implied by this method, so concurrent access should
    be handled by the caller if needed.
  warnings: Disabling event processing may cause bot spawn events to be lost or delayed
    until re-enabled. Ensure that disabling occurs only during appropriate maintenance
    windows or when the system can gracefully handle missed events.
