  signature: int ClassAIFactory::CreateWarriorAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new warrior AI instance for a bot and returns its identifier.
  description: The CreateWarriorAI method initializes a new warrior AI controller
    for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This function allocates
    memory for the AI, sets up the necessary combat behaviors and decision-making
    logic specific to warrior class, and registers the AI with the game world. The
    method returns an integer identifier that can be used to reference or manage the
    created AI instance. This is typically used in bot management systems where automated
    player characters need to be controlled with specific class-based behavior patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer identifier representing the newly created warrior AI
    instance. A positive value indicates successful creation, while a negative value
    typically signifies an error or failure in the creation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Warrior AI Creation
    code: "int botAIId = factory->CreateWarriorAI(&bot);\nif (botAIId > 0) {\n   \
      \ // Successfully created warrior AI\n    printf(\"Warrior AI created with ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", botAIId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to create warrior AI\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot parameter points to a valid bot object that
    has been properly initialized. The returned AI identifier should be stored for
    later reference when managing or destroying the AI instance. Performance considerations
    include memory allocation and initialization overhead which may impact server
    performance if called excessively in tight loops.
  warnings: The method requires that the bot parameter points to a valid, initialized
    bot object; otherwise behavior is undefined. Improper handling of the returned
    identifier can lead to memory leaks or access violations when managing AI instances.
    Ensure proper cleanup of AI instances to prevent resource leaks.
