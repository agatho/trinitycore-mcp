documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild rank of the player
  description: This method retrieves the current guild rank of the player, which determines
    their permissions and privileges within the guild. The returned value represents
    the rank level (1-10) where 1 is the highest rank (Guild Master) and 10 is the
    lowest rank (Initiate). This method is commonly used in guild management systems
    to determine player permissions and to enforce guild hierarchy rules. The value
    is typically set during character creation or when joining a guild, and can be
    modified through guild commands or by guild leaders.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an unsigned 8-bit integer representing the guild rank level, where
    1 indicates the highest rank (Guild Master) and 10 indicates the lowest rank (Initiate).
    Values outside this range may indicate an error condition or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 rank = player->GetGuildRank();\nif (rank == 1)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ is Guild Master\n}\nelse if (rank == 10)\n{\n    // Player is Initiate\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance
    impact is minimal as it simply returns a stored value without complex computations.
    The method may return 0 if the player is not in a guild, which should be handled
    carefully in code.
  warnings: The returned rank value may be 0 if the player has no guild membership,
    which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the player's guild status. Care
    should be taken when comparing against 0 to avoid confusion with invalid states
    versus no guild membership.
