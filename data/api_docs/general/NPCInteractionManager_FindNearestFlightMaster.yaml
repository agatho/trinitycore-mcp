  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: FindNearestFlightMaster
  signature: Creature * NPCInteractionManager::FindNearestFlightMaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the nearest Flight Master creature within the player's
    current map.
  description: The FindNearestFlightMaster method searches for the closest creature
    that is classified as a Flight Master within the same map as the calling NPCInteractionManager
    instance. This method is typically used during NPC interaction to locate available
    flight masters for teleportation services. The search considers only creatures
    that are currently spawned and visible in the player's world. If no valid Flight
    Master is found, the method returns a null pointer. This functionality is essential
    for implementing proper flight path navigation in World of Warcraft-style game
    systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Creature object representing the nearest Flight Master,
    or nullptr if none is found within the current map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* flightMaster = npcInteractionManager->FindNearestFlightMaster();\n\
      if (flightMaster != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with flight master interaction\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Found Flight Master: %s\"\
      , flightMaster->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No flight master available\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"No Flight Master found nearby.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial search within the current map only. It does
    not consider creatures in other maps or instances. The implementation relies on
    internal creature positioning and visibility checks, which may be affected by
    server performance and world state.
  warnings: The returned Creature pointer should always be checked for null before
    use to prevent segmentation faults. Additionally, this method may return different
    results depending on the current map state and whether creatures are properly
    spawned or visible to the player.
