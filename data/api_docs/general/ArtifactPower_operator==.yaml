  class: ArtifactPower
  method: operator==
  signature: bool ArtifactPower::operator==(const ArtifactPower & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two ArtifactPower objects for equality based on their internal data.
  description: The operator== method performs a comparison between this ArtifactPower
    object and another ArtifactPower object to determine if they are equal. This comparison
    is typically based on the artifact power's unique identifier, level, or other
    relevant properties that define its state. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, artifact powers represent the abilities and enhancements associated
    with an artifact weapon, and this method allows developers to check whether two
    artifact power instances represent the same power with identical properties. The
    comparison is performed in a const context, ensuring no modifications are made
    during evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The ArtifactPower object to compare against this instance for equality.
  returns: Returns true if both ArtifactPower objects have equivalent data (such as
    same ID, level, and state), otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two artifact powers
    code: 'ArtifactPower power1;

      ArtifactPower power2;

      bool isEqual = (power1 == power2); // Returns true if both powers are identical'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using operator== in a conditional statement for artifact power validation
    code: "if (playerArtifactPower == targetArtifactPower)\n{\n    // Perform action\
      \ when artifact powers match\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Artifact powers are identical.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is commonly used in collections or containers where ArtifactPower
    objects need to be compared for duplicate entries. It's important to note that
    the equality check may involve deep comparisons of internal fields rather than
    just pointer equality.
