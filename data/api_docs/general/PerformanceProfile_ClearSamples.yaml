documentation:
  brief: Clears all collected performance samples from the profile.
  description: The ClearSamples method resets the internal sample collection of a
    PerformanceProfile object, removing all previously recorded performance data.
    This method is typically used to reset profiling metrics before starting a new
    measurement period or to free up memory occupied by stored samples. The operation
    is immediate and does not require any external resources or state changes beyond
    clearing the internal data structures.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      // ... collect some samples ...

      profile.ClearSamples(); // Reset all collected samples'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an in-place reset of the sample buffer and should be
    called when starting a new profiling session to ensure accurate measurements.
    It is safe to call multiple times consecutively.
