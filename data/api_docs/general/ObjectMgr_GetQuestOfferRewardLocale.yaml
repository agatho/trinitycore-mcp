  brief: Retrieves the locale-specific offer reward text for a quest entry
  description: The GetQuestOfferRewardLocale method fetches the localized offer reward
    text associated with a specific quest entry. This method is used in the TrinityCore
    framework to retrieve quest-related text data that may vary based on the player's
    locale settings. The returned pointer points to an array of integers representing
    the localized strings for different locales. If no localized data exists for the
    specified quest, the method returns a null pointer or an empty array. This functionality
    supports the internationalization features of World of Warcraft quests, allowing
    quest rewards to be displayed in the appropriate language based on the client's
    locale settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array containing locale-specific offer reward
    text identifiers for the quest entry. Returns nullptr if no localized data is
    available for the specified quest.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use quest offer reward locale
    code: "const int* rewardLocales = sObjectMgr->GetQuestOfferRewardLocale(12345);\n\
      if (rewardLocales != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the localized reward text identifiers\n\
      \    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_LOCALES; ++i)\n    {\n        if (rewardLocales[i]\
      \ != 0)\n        {\n            // Use rewardLocales[i] to fetch actual localized\
      \ text\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr class which manages all game objects
    and data in TrinityCore. The returned integer array typically represents indices
    into a localization table. The method assumes that quest data has been properly
    loaded from the database and that the quest entry exists. Performance-wise, this
    method performs a lookup in an internal data structure, so it should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest entry parameter is valid before calling this method
    to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The returned pointer must not
    be modified as it points to internal data structures. Always check for null return
    values before dereferencing the result.
