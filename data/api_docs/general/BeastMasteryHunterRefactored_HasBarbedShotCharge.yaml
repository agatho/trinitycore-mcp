documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the hunter has an available Barbed Shot charge.
  description: This method determines if the Beast Mastery hunter class currently
    possesses an active Barbed Shot charge. Barbed Shot is a talent that allows hunters
    to apply a damaging debuff to their target, which can be consumed for additional
    damage. The method returns true if there is at least one charge available and
    false otherwise. This check is typically used in conjunction with the hunter's
    ability to use Barbed Shot, ensuring proper resource management and cooldown handling
    within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has at least one Barbed Shot charge available;
    otherwise returns false.

    code: "if (hunter->HasBarbedShotCharge()) {\n    // Use Barbed Shot ability\n\
      \    hunter->UseBarbedShot();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no charges\
      \ are available\n    SendChatMessage(\"No Barbed Shot charges remaining.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal charge tracking systems within
    the hunter's ability manager. It may be called frequently during combat to determine
    valid action usage.
