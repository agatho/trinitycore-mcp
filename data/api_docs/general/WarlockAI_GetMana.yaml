documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current mana amount of the warlock AI unit
  description: The GetMana method returns the current mana value of the WarlockAI
    unit. This method is typically used within the AI logic to determine whether the
    warlock has sufficient mana to cast spells or perform mana-intensive abilities.
    The returned value represents the actual current mana points available, which
    can be used by the AI to make decisions about spell casting and behavior. This
    method does not modify any internal state and simply provides a read-only view
    of the unit's mana resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current mana amount of the warlock AI unit.
    This value corresponds to the unit's actual mana points, ranging from 0 up to
    the maximum mana capacity of the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mana Check
    code: "if (warlockAI->GetMana() > 50)\n{\n    // Cast a spell that requires at\
      \ least 50 mana\n    warlockAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana-Based AI Decision Making
    code: "uint32 currentMana = warlockAI->GetMana();\nif (currentMana >= 100)\n{\n\
      \    // High mana: use high-damage spells\n    warlockAI->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_IMMOLATE);\n}\nelse if (currentMana >= 50)\n{\n    // Medium mana: use\
      \ medium-damage spells\n    warlockAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CORRUPTION);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Low mana: conserve resources or flee\n    warlockAI->DoFlee();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the unit's current mana value directly from its internal
    state. It is recommended to cache this value if it will be used multiple times
    within a single AI decision cycle to avoid unnecessary repeated calls. The method
    should only be called on valid WarlockAI instances that have been properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling GetMana() on a null or uninitialized WarlockAI instance will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure proper null checks are performed before calling
    this method. Additionally, the returned value may change between consecutive calls
    if the unit's mana is modified by other systems (e.g., spell casting, damage,
    or healing).
