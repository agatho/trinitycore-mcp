  brief: Initializes race-specific bonuses for professions within the ProfessionManager.
  description: The InitializeRaceBonuses method sets up and configures bonus multipliers
    or modifiers that apply to player professions based on their racial traits. This
    method is typically invoked during the initialization phase of a player's session
    or when loading profession data, ensuring that each race receives appropriate
    bonuses according to game mechanics. It handles internal data structures related
    to racial proficiency adjustments and prepares them for use in subsequent profession
    calculations. The method does not require any external input parameters and operates
    on the internal state of the ProfessionManager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization lifecycle
    of a ProfessionManager instance. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in
    a single-threaded context to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate or inconsistent
    bonus configurations. Ensure that it's invoked before any profession-related operations
    are performed.
