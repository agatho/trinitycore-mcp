  class: ObjectGridLoaderBase
  method: ObjectGridLoaderBase
  signature: void ObjectGridLoaderBase::ObjectGridLoaderBase(NGridType & grid, int
    * map, const int & cell)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ObjectGridLoaderBase instance with grid, map, and cell parameters
    for object loading in a grid-based world system.
  description: The ObjectGridLoaderBase constructor initializes a loader object that
    manages the loading of game objects within a specific grid cell. This class is
    part of TrinityCore's grid-based world system where the game world is divided
    into grids and cells for efficient object management and spatial queries. The
    constructor takes a reference to an NGridType representing the grid, a pointer
    to an integer map identifier, and a reference to an integer cell identifier. It
    sets up internal state necessary for loading objects into the specified grid cell,
    ensuring proper coordination with the broader world management system. This initialization
    is crucial for maintaining object visibility and interaction within the game world's
    spatial structure.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Reference to an NGridType object representing the grid cell where
      objects will be loaded. This parameter defines the spatial boundaries and management
      context for object loading operations.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to an integer value identifying the map instance. This represents
      the specific game map or zone where the grid cell resides, used for proper object
      association and world state management.
  - name: cell
    description: Reference to an integer value specifying the cell identifier within
      the grid. This identifies the precise location within the grid's coordinate
      system for object loading operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ObjectGridLoaderBase Initialization
    code: 'NGridType& grid = map->GetGrid(x, y);

      int mapId = 0;

      int cellX = 10;

      int cellY = 15;

      ObjectGridLoaderBase loader(grid, &mapId, cellX);

      // Initializes loader for grid cell (10, 15) on map 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by TrinityCore's world management
    system during grid loading operations. Developers should not directly instantiate
    ObjectGridLoaderBase objects unless working with low-level grid management code.
    The class is designed to work within the context of TrinityCore's spatial partitioning
    system and requires proper initialization of grid and map data structures before
    use.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values for grid, map, or cell can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes during object loading operations. The map pointer must be
    valid and point to a properly initialized map instance. This constructor does
    not perform validation of input parameters, so callers must ensure correct initialization
    of all referenced objects.
