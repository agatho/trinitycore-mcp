  class: GuildScript
  method: OnInfoChanged
  signature: void GuildScript::OnInfoChanged(Guild * guild, const std::string & newInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a guild's information text is modified, allowing scripts to
    react to changes in guild details.
  description: The OnInfoChanged method is a callback function that gets triggered
    whenever the information text of a guild is updated. This event occurs when a
    guild leader or officer modifies the guild's 'info' field through in-game commands
    or UI elements. The method provides access to both the modified guild object and
    the new information string, enabling custom logic such as logging changes, sending
    notifications, or triggering other game events based on the updated guild data.
    This callback is part of the GuildScript system which allows developers to extend
    or modify guild behavior through scripting.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to the Guild object whose information has been changed. This
      parameter provides access to all guild properties and methods for further processing.
  - name: newInfo
    description: The new information text that was set for the guild. This string
      contains the updated value of the guild's info field as provided by the user.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnInfoChanged(Guild*\
      \ guild, const std::string& newInfo) override\n    {\n        // Log the change\
      \ to the server console\n        sLog->outString(\"Guild %s info changed to:\
      \ %s\", guild->GetName().c_str(), newInfo.c_str());\n        \n        // Send\
      \ a message to all guild members\n        guild->BroadcastToGuild(sWorld, \"\
      Guild info has been updated.\");\n    }\n};"

    code: "class ValidatingGuildScript : public GuildScript\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ OnInfoChanged(Guild* guild, const std::string& newInfo) override\n    {\n\
      \        // Check if the new info contains prohibited content\n        if (newInfo.find(\"\
      badword\") != std::string::npos)\n        {\n            // Revert to previous\
      \ info or notify admin\n            sLog->outString(\"Blocked invalid guild\
      \ info change for guild %s\", guild->GetName().c_str());\n            return;\n\
      \        }\n        \n        // Store the new info in a custom database table\n\
      \        // ... database logic here ...\n        \n        // Notify all online\
      \ members\n        guild->BroadcastToGuild(sWorld, \"Guild information updated\
      \ successfully.\");\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called synchronously during the guild info update process.
    Script implementations should avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls
    that could impact server performance. The Guild object passed to this method is
    guaranteed to be valid and fully initialized at the time of the callback.
  warnings: Avoid modifying the guild object within this callback as it may cause
    undefined behavior or infinite recursion. Do not perform database operations directly
    in this function without proper locking mechanisms. Be cautious about accessing
    other systems that might not yet have been updated with the new info value.
