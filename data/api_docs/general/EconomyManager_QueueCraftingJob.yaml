  signature: void EconomyManager::QueueCraftingJob(uint32 recipeId, uint32 quantity)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a crafting job for the specified recipe and quantity.
  description: The QueueCraftingJob method schedules a crafting operation within the
    EconomyManager system. It takes a recipe identifier and a quantity parameter to
    determine what item to craft and how many times to produce it. This method typically
    interacts with the player's crafting queue, adding the job to be processed at
    a later time. The actual crafting process may depend on available resources, player
    skills, and other game mechanics such as cooldowns or resource requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: recipeId
    description: Unique identifier for the crafting recipe to be queued. This value
      corresponds to an entry in the game's crafting database.
  - name: quantity
    description: The number of items to craft. Must be a positive integer representing
      how many times the recipe should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Crafting Job Queueing
    code: 'EconomyManager* manager = player->GetEconomyManager();

      manager->QueueCraftingJob(12345, 1); // Queue one crafted item based on recipe
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Crafting Job Queueing
    code: 'EconomyManager* manager = player->GetEconomyManager();

      manager->QueueCraftingJob(67890, 10); // Queue ten crafted items based on recipe
      ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately execute the crafting. It merely adds the
    job to an internal queue that will be processed by the game's economy system.
    The actual crafting may take time depending on the recipe's complexity, player
    skill level, and server load.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided recipeId exists in the database; otherwise, the
    method might silently fail or throw an error during job execution. Also, verify
    that the quantity is valid (greater than zero) to avoid unexpected behavior.
