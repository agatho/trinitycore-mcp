  class: Creature
  method: GetOriginalEntry
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetOriginalEntry() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the original entry ID of the creature before any modifications or
    transformations.
  description: The GetOriginalEntry method retrieves the original entry ID of a creature,
    which is typically used to identify the base creature template before any changes
    made during runtime. This value is crucial for tracking the creature's true identity
    and understanding its base properties, especially in scenarios involving creature
    transformation or temporary modifications. The method provides access to the creature's
    original entry ID, which remains constant even if the creature's current entry
    ID changes due to transformations or other gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 representing the original entry ID of the creature,
    which is typically the base creature template ID. This value remains unchanged
    regardless of any temporary modifications made during runtime.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      uint32 originalEntry = creature->GetOriginalEntry();

      // originalEntry will contain the base creature entry ID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is particularly useful when dealing with creature transformations
    or temporary modifications. The value returned represents the original template
    entry ID and should not be confused with the current entry ID which may change
    during gameplay.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the original entry ID, not the current
    entry ID. If a creature has been transformed or modified during runtime, this
    value will still reflect the base template entry ID.
