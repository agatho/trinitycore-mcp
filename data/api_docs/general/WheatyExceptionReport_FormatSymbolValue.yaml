  class: WheatyExceptionReport
  method: FormatSymbolValue
  signature: bool WheatyExceptionReport::FormatSymbolValue(PSYMBOL_INFO param0, EnumerateSymbolsCallbackContext
    * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Formats symbol information for exception reporting in TrinityCore.
  description: The FormatSymbolValue method processes symbol information retrieved
    during exception handling to generate human-readable debug output. It is typically
    invoked as part of the WheatyExceptionReport class's symbol enumeration process,
    where it takes a SYMBOL_INFO structure and formats its contents into a string
    representation suitable for logging or display. This method plays a crucial role
    in debugging crash reports within the TrinityCore server environment, allowing
    developers to inspect variable values, function names, and memory addresses at
    the time of an exception. The method operates on the provided symbol information
    and updates the callback context with formatted output.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to a SYMBOL_INFO structure containing detailed symbol information
      including name, address, size, and type data.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to an EnumerateSymbolsCallbackContext structure that holds
      the context for symbol enumeration and stores formatted output results.
  returns: Returns true if the symbol value was successfully formatted and added to
    the callback context; otherwise, returns false if formatting failed or encountered
    an error during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in exception handling
    code: "WheatyExceptionReport report;\nPSYMBOL_INFO symbolInfo = new SYMBOL_INFO();\n\
      EnumerateSymbolsCallbackContext context;\nbool result = report.FormatSymbolValue(symbolInfo,\
      \ &context);\nif (result) {\n    // Symbol was formatted successfully\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Formatted symbol: \" << context.formattedOutput << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the WheatyExceptionReport class
    for crash dump analysis. It assumes that the SYMBOL_INFO and EnumerateSymbolsCallbackContext
    structures are properly initialized before calling. The method may perform memory
    allocations or string operations, so it should be called in contexts where such
    operations are safe.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with uninitialized SYMBOL_INFO or callback
    context structures as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper
    error handling around the return value since failures can occur during symbol
    formatting.
