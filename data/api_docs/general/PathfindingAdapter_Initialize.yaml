  class: PathfindingAdapter
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool PathfindingAdapter::Initialize(uint32 cacheSize, uint32 cacheDuration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the pathfinding adapter with specified cache settings
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal caching mechanism for the
    PathfindingAdapter class. It configures the maximum size of the pathfinding cache
    and the duration for which cached paths remain valid. This method must be called
    before any pathfinding operations can be performed. The cache helps improve performance
    by avoiding redundant path calculations for frequently requested routes. If initialization
    fails, subsequent pathfinding calls may not work correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: cacheSize
    description: Maximum number of paths that can be stored in the internal cache.
      Must be a positive integer. Larger values allow more paths to be cached but
      consume more memory.
  - name: cacheDuration
    description: Time duration (in seconds) for which cached paths remain valid before
      being invalidated. Must be a positive integer. Higher values increase cache
      hit rates but may result in outdated path information if the environment changes
      significantly.
  returns: Returns true if initialization was successful and the adapter is ready
    for use, false otherwise. Initialization failure typically occurs due to invalid
    parameters or system resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: "PathfindingAdapter adapter;\nbool success = adapter.Initialize(1000, 300);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Adapter is ready for pathfinding operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization with Performance Tuning
    code: "PathfindingAdapter adapter;\n// Configure for high-performance scenario\
      \ with large cache\nbool success = adapter.Initialize(5000, 600);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // High cache size and long duration for reduced computation overhead\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The Initialize method should only be called once during the adapter's lifetime.
    Subsequent calls may not have any effect or could cause undefined behavior. The
    cache implementation uses a least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy when the
    maximum size is exceeded. Memory usage increases linearly with cacheSize parameter.
  warnings: Passing zero or negative values for cacheSize or cacheDuration will likely
    result in initialization failure. Setting cacheSize too high may cause memory
    exhaustion on systems with limited resources. Setting cacheDuration too low reduces
    caching benefits, while setting it too high may lead to stale path data if the
    game world changes frequently.
