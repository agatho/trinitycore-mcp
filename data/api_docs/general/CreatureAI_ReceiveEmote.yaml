documentation:
  brief: Handles emote events received by a creature AI instance
  description: The ReceiveEmote method is invoked when a creature AI receives an emote
    from a player or another source. This method processes the emote event and can
    trigger specific behaviors or responses within the creature's AI logic. It typically
    handles emotes such as greetings, gestures, or other interactive actions that
    may influence the creature's state or behavior. The method is part of the core
    AI system in TrinityCore and integrates with the game's emote handling framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents the emote
      type or identifier received by the creature
  - name: param1
    description: Integer parameter that typically holds additional data related to
      the emote, such as the source of the emote or its context
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic emote handling in custom AI
    code: "void CustomCreatureAI::ReceiveEmote(int* emoteType, int emoteData)\n{\n\
      \    if (*emoteType == EMOTE_STATE_SALUTE)\n    {\n        // Respond to a salute\
      \ emote\n        Talk(0);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    an emote event occurs. Developers should ensure that any custom AI logic implemented
    in this method does not block or cause performance issues, as it may be invoked
    frequently during player interactions.
  warnings: Improper handling of emote parameters can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that param0 is properly dereferenced and validated before use.
    Avoid performing heavy operations within this method to maintain game responsiveness.
