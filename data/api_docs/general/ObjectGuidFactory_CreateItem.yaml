  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreateItem
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateItem(uint32 realmId, uint64 dbId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for an item within the specified realm and database
    identifier.
  description: The CreateItem method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically for
    game items in TrinityCore. It combines the provided realm ID and database ID to
    construct a valid GUID that can be used to uniquely identify items across the
    game world. This method is typically used when spawning or referencing items in
    the game environment, ensuring each item has a globally unique identifier within
    the context of the realm. The generated GUID follows the standard TrinityCore
    ObjectGuid format which includes type information, realm ID, and instance-specific
    identifiers.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the item exists or will
      be created. This value determines the realm portion of the GUID and must correspond
      to a valid realm in the database.
  - name: dbId
    description: The database identifier for the item, typically corresponding to
      the item's entry in the database tables. This ID is used to construct the unique
      portion of the GUID that distinguishes this specific item from others.
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid object representing the unique identifier for the
    item. The returned GUID contains all necessary components to uniquely identify
    the item within the TrinityCore system, including realm information and item-specific
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a GUID for a new item
    code: 'ObjectGuid itemGuid = guidFactory.CreateItem(1, 45678);

      // Creates a GUID for an item with database ID 45678 in realm 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the created GUID to spawn an item
    code: 'ObjectGuid itemGuid = guidFactory.CreateItem(1, 12345);

      Item* newItem = new Item();

      newItem->SetGUID(itemGuid);

      newItem->SetEntry(12345);

      // Spawns a new item with the generated GUID'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that realmId and dbId are valid values. The resulting
    ObjectGuid will have the item type flag set appropriately. The method does not
    perform any validation on whether the item actually exists in the database, it
    only constructs a valid GUID for use with items.
  warnings: Ensure that the realmId corresponds to an active realm in your TrinityCore
    instance, otherwise the GUID may not be properly recognized by the game server.
    Be cautious when reusing database IDs as this can lead to GUID conflicts if not
    handled properly.
