documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is currently in a group.
  description: The IsInGroup method determines if the player associated with the GroupCoordinator
    instance is currently a member of any group (raid or party). This method performs
    a simple check against the internal group state and returns true if the player
    has been assigned to a group, false otherwise. The method is commonly used in
    game logic to conditionally execute code based on group membership status, such
    as determining whether to allow certain actions or display specific UI elements.
    It does not validate the group's current state or activity level; it only confirms
    membership.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in a group (either a party or raid),
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->IsInGroup()) {\n    // Player is in a group, perform\
      \ group-specific actions\n    SendGroupMessage(\"Welcome to the group!\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Player is not in a group\n    SendPrivateMessage(\"You are\
      \ not in a group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Group Action
    code: "void HandlePlayerCommand() {\n    if (groupCoordinator->IsInGroup()) {\n\
      \        // Allow group-based commands\n        ProcessGroupCommand();\n   \
      \ } else {\n        // Deny command if not in group\n        SendError(\"You\
      \ must be in a group to use this command.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the GroupCoordinator
    and assumes that group membership is properly maintained by the TrinityCore framework.
    It should not be used as a substitute for validating group activity or permissions,
    but rather for basic membership checks.
