  class: VendorInteraction
  method: PlanVendorTrip
  signature: void VendorInteraction::PlanVendorTrip(Player * player, const int & itemsToBuy,
    const int & itemsToSell)
documentation:
  brief: Plans a vendor trip for the specified player, determining items to buy and
    sell based on input parameters.
  description: The PlanVendorTrip method orchestrates the logic for planning a vendor
    interaction for a given player. It takes into account the number of items the
    player wishes to buy and sell, and determines appropriate actions such as visiting
    vendors, purchasing items, or selling excess inventory. This method is typically
    used in automated quest or resource management systems within TrinityCore's AI
    or scripting framework. The method does not directly interact with the game world
    but rather prepares a plan that can be executed later by other systems.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the vendor trip is being planned.
      Must not be null.
  - name: itemsToBuy
    description: Integer value representing the number of items the player intends
      to purchase from vendors. Should be non-negative.
  - name: itemsToSell
    description: Integer value representing the number of items the player intends
      to sell to vendors. Should be non-negative.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Trip Planning
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      int buyCount = 5;

      int sellCount = 3;

      VendorInteraction vendorInteraction;

      vendorInteraction.PlanVendorTrip(player, buyCount, sellCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Planning a Trip with Zero Items
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      VendorInteraction vendorInteraction;

      vendorInteraction.PlanVendorTrip(player, 0, 0); // No items to buy or sell'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger vendor interaction system and likely integrates
    with inventory management and quest logic. It assumes that the player object passed
    in has valid data and is currently in a state where vendor interactions are possible.
    The actual execution of the trip plan may require additional calls to other methods
    or systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, the values for
    itemsToBuy and itemsToSell should be validated to prevent negative numbers which
    might cause unexpected results in downstream logic.
