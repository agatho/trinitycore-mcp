documentation:
  brief: Stops the performance timer and records the elapsed time for economy-related
    operations.
  description: The EndPerformanceTimer method is used to conclude a performance measurement
    cycle that was initiated by a corresponding StartPerformanceTimer call. This method
    typically logs or stores the duration of time taken for various economy-related
    activities such as item transactions, currency exchanges, or market operations
    within the TrinityCore framework. It plays a crucial role in profiling and optimizing
    the performance of in-game economic systems. The method does not require any parameters
    and performs no direct return value operations; instead, it updates internal timing
    metrics used for diagnostic purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = sWorld->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->EndPerformanceTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a matching StartPerformanceTimer
    call has been made. Failure to do so may result in incorrect timing data or undefined
    behavior. The performance timer is typically used for debugging and optimization
    purposes within the TrinityCore server environment.
