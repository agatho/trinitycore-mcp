    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a social reward value for a bot based on player interaction
    success.
  description: The CalculateSocialReward method computes a floating-point reward value
    that represents the social benefit or consequence of a bot's interaction with
    a player. This value is typically used within the behavior adaptation system to
    influence how bots adjust their social strategies and responses. The reward is
    determined by evaluating the outcome of an interaction, where a successful interaction
    generally yields a positive reward, and a failed one may yield a negative or neutral
    value. The method takes into account the bot's current state and the player's
    response to determine this reward. This calculation plays a crucial role in shaping
    the bot's long-term social behavior patterns within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose social reward
      is being calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: interactionSuccess
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the recent interaction with the player
      was successful (true) or not (false). Determines the direction and magnitude
      of the reward value.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated social reward. Positive values
    indicate beneficial outcomes, while negative values suggest detrimental interactions.
    The exact scale and interpretation depend on internal behavior adaptation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in behavior adaptation
    code: 'float reward = behaviorAdaptation.CalculateSocialReward(playerBot, true);

      // reward will be a positive value if the interaction was successful'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using reward to adjust bot behavior
    code: "float reward = behaviorAdaptation.CalculateSocialReward(bot, false);\n\
      if (reward < 0)\n{\n    // Adjust bot's social strategy to avoid similar interactions\n\
      \    bot->SetSocialBehavior(SocialBehavior::CAUTIOUS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the behavior adaptation system and likely integrates
    with other reward calculation mechanisms. The actual reward computation logic
    may be influenced by various factors such as player reputation, bot personality
    traits, or previous interaction history. It's important to note that this method
    does not modify any state directly but rather provides a value for external systems
    to use in decision-making.
  warnings: Ensure the 'bot' parameter is valid and not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The returned
    reward value should be interpreted within the context of the broader behavior
    adaptation system to avoid misapplication.
