  class: SimpleResource
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void SimpleResource::Regenerate(uint32 deltaMs, bool inCombat)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the resource's current value based on regeneration rate and time
    delta.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for updating a SimpleResource's
    current value over time, taking into account the elapsed time since last update
    and whether the entity is in combat. This method typically handles the automatic
    replenishment of resources such as mana, energy, or focus. When in combat, regeneration
    rates may be modified or paused depending on game mechanics. The method uses the
    provided delta time to calculate how much the resource should regenerate, ensuring
    smooth and consistent gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: deltaMs
    description: The time elapsed since last regeneration update, measured in milliseconds.
      This value determines how much time has passed for which the resource should
      regenerate.
  - name: inCombat
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the entity is currently in combat.
      When true, certain regeneration behaviors may be altered or suspended according
      to game rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second

      bool isInCombat = false;

      resource->Regenerate(deltaTime, isInCombat);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Regeneration During Combat
    code: 'uint32 deltaTime = 500; // 0.5 seconds

      bool isInCombat = true;

      resource->Regenerate(deltaTime, isInCombat);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from game loop updates or periodic tick handlers
    to ensure resources regenerate smoothly over time. It's important that deltaMs
    accurately reflects the actual time passed to maintain consistent resource regeneration
    rates.
  warnings: Incorrect deltaMs values can cause erratic regeneration behavior, such
    as skipping regeneration steps or regenerating too quickly. Always ensure that
    inCombat flag is correctly updated based on entity state.
