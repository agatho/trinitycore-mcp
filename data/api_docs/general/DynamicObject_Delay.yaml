  class: DynamicObject
  method: Delay
  signature: void DynamicObject::Delay(int delaytime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a delay timer for the dynamic object, causing it to be removed after
    the specified time.
  description: The Delay method schedules the removal of a DynamicObject after a specified
    delay period. This is commonly used for spells or effects that have a duration,
    such as area-of-effect spells or traps. The method sets an internal timer that
    will trigger the object's destruction once the delay time has elapsed. The delay
    time is specified in milliseconds. This functionality is integral to managing
    temporary game objects like spell effects, traps, or environmental effects that
    should automatically disappear after a certain period.
  parameters:
  - name: delaytime
    description: The delay time in milliseconds before the dynamic object is removed.
      Must be a positive integer value representing the duration of the delay.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Delay Usage
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();

      dynObj->Delay(5000); // Delay for 5 seconds before removal'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delay with Spell Effect
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();\n    dynObj->Delay(spellInfo->Duration);\
      \ // Delay based on spell duration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The delay timer is managed internally by the server and will automatically
    remove the object when the time expires. This method does not immediately destroy
    the object, but rather schedules its removal. The actual removal happens during
    the next update cycle of the dynamic object manager.
  warnings: Calling Delay() on an already delayed object may overwrite the previous
    delay timer. Ensure that delay values are properly validated to avoid unexpected
    behavior or potential server performance issues with very long delays.
