  class: Scenario
  method: SendAllData
  signature: void Scenario::SendAllData(const int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends all scenario data to the client for the specified scenario.
  description: The SendAllData method is responsible for transmitting complete scenario-related
    information to the connected client. This includes all relevant scenario state,
    objectives, rewards, and progress data that the player needs to understand their
    current scenario status. The method typically gets invoked when a player enters
    a scenario or when scenario data needs to be refreshed in the client interface.
    It ensures that the player's UI accurately reflects the ongoing scenario conditions
    and available actions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents the scenario
      ID or index. This value determines which specific scenario data should be sent
      to the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Scenario Data for a Specific Scenario
    code: 'int scenarioId = 1234;

      scenario->SendAllData(&scenarioId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    scenario state changes or when a player enters a scenario zone. The method likely
    constructs and sends a packet containing all relevant scenario information to
    maintain synchronization between server and client.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameter passed is a valid scenario identifier to prevent
    sending incorrect data or causing client-side errors. This method should only
    be called when the scenario is properly initialized and ready for client communication.
