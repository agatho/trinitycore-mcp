  class: Loot
  method: hasItemFor
  signature: bool Loot::hasItemFor(const Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player has the necessary loot item permissions to receive
    items from this loot object.
  description: The hasItemFor method checks if a given player is eligible to receive
    loot items from this specific Loot object. This typically involves verifying that
    the player meets requirements such as being in the same group or raid, having
    proper loot permissions (e.g., master looter status), and satisfying any item-specific
    restrictions like level requirements or quest prerequisites. The method is commonly
    used during loot distribution to filter out players who should not receive certain
    items. It does not modify the state of the Loot object or the player, and it's
    designed to be called frequently during loot processing without significant performance
    impact.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object for which to check loot eligibility.
      Must not be null. The method will evaluate whether this specific player has
      permission to receive items from this Loot instance based on group membership,
      loot rules, and item restrictions.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is eligible to receive items from
    this Loot object; otherwise returns false. This indicates that the player meets
    all necessary conditions for loot distribution, such as being in the correct group
    or having appropriate permissions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player can receive loot
    code: "Loot* loot = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nPlayer* player = ...;\
      \ // Assume this is initialized\nif (loot->hasItemFor(player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can receive items from this loot\n    // Proceed with loot distribution logic\n\
      } else {\n    // Player cannot receive items from this loot\n    // Skip or\
      \ handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in loot distribution loop
    code: "for (auto& player : groupMembers) {\n    if (loot->hasItemFor(player))\
      \ {\n        // Distribute loot to this player\n        loot->DistributeToPlayer(player);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Skip this player for this loot\n        continue;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot distribution phase of a group
    or raid encounter. It's important to note that even if a player passes this check,
    they may still be filtered out by additional conditions such as item-specific
    requirements or roll-based loot systems. The method assumes that the Loot object
    has already been initialized with appropriate data and that the player pointer
    is valid.
  warnings: Do not call this method on a Loot object that hasn't been properly initialized
    with items or group information, as it may lead to undefined behavior. Also, be
    aware that this check does not account for temporary conditions like being in
    combat or having loot rules temporarily disabled; it only evaluates static eligibility
    criteria.
