documentation:
  brief: Notifies the creature's AI that engagement with a target has ended
  description: The EngagementOver method is called when a CreatureAI instance should
    no longer consider its current target as engaged. This typically occurs after
    combat has concluded, a target has been defeated, or the creature has otherwise
    disengaged from combat. The method may reset internal AI state, clear target references,
    and prepare the AI for potential new engagement scenarios. It is part of the core
    AI lifecycle management within TrinityCore's creature behavior system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat End Scenario
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup and notify\
      \ AI of engagement ending\n    EngagementOver();\n    // Additional post-combat\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core game engine upon
    completion of combat events or when a creature's target becomes invalid. Developers
    should not call this method directly unless implementing custom AI behavior that
    requires explicit engagement state management.
