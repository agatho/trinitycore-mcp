  class: EvokerBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool EvokerBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the evoker's baseline rotation logic for spell casting and ability
    management.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method performs the core logic of an evoker's baseline
    rotation, determining which spells or abilities to cast based on current game
    state, resource levels, and target conditions. It integrates with the BaselineRotationManager
    to coordinate actions and returns a boolean indicating whether the rotation was
    successfully executed. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle
    to make real-time decisions about spell selection and execution for evoker characters
    in TrinityCore environments.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the evoker bot character instance that will execute the
      rotation.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target character or game object that the bot is casting
      spells on.
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager which handles rotation state
      and coordination logic.
  returns: Returns true if the rotation was successfully executed and at least one
    action was performed, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        int botPtr = reinterpret_cast<int>(me);\n        int targetPtr\
      \ = reinterpret_cast<int>(target);\n        BaselineRotationManager manager;\n\
      \        if (!rotation.ExecuteRotation(&botPtr, &targetPtr, manager))\n    \
      \    {\n            // Handle rotation failure\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the state of the bot and target units to make
    intelligent casting decisions. It may interact with internal cooldown tracking,
    mana management, and spell priority systems within the BaselineRotationManager.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The method assumes proper initialization of
    the BaselineRotationManager.
