  brief: Clears all queued spells from the AI's spell casting queue
  description: The ClearSpellQueue method removes all pending spell casts from the
    ThreadSafeClassAI's internal spell queue. This method is typically used to interrupt
    or cancel ongoing spell sequences, ensuring that no queued spells are executed.
    The operation is thread-safe and designed to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded
    environments where AI behavior might be modified concurrently. It effectively
    resets the spell casting state for the AI instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Clear any queued spells when entering\
      \ combat\n    ClearSpellQueue();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupting Spell Casting
    code: "void MyAI::OnTargetDied(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Cancel all queued spells\
      \ when target dies\n    ClearSpellQueue();\n    // Perform additional actions\
      \ after clearing queue\n    DoCast(SPELL_REBIRTH);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within AI context and should not
    be used in situations where thread safety cannot be guaranteed. The spell queue
    is typically managed internally by the AI system, so direct manipulation of this
    queue should be done carefully.
  warnings: Calling ClearSpellQueue() while another thread is actively processing
    spell casts may lead to undefined behavior if proper synchronization mechanisms
    are not in place. Ensure that all spell-related operations are properly synchronized
    when using this method in multi-threaded contexts.
