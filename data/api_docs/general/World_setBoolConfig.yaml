  class: World
  method: setBoolConfig
  signature: void World::setBoolConfig(WorldBoolConfigs index, bool value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a boolean configuration value in the World object by index.
  description: The setBoolConfig method is used to update a specific boolean configuration
    setting within the World class. This method accepts an index representing a predefined
    configuration option and a boolean value to assign to that setting. The configuration
    options are typically defined in the WorldBoolConfigs enumeration, which maps
    to various game settings such as enabling/disabling PvP, allowing gm tickets,
    or toggling debug features. This method is part of TrinityCore's core configuration
    management system, allowing runtime modification of server behavior without requiring
    a restart. Changes made using this method take immediate effect within the running
    world instance.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: An enumeration value of type WorldBoolConfigs that specifies which
      boolean configuration setting to modify. This index maps to predefined game
      settings such as PvPEnabled, GmTicketSystem, or DebugMode.
  - name: value
    description: A boolean value (true or false) to assign to the specified configuration
      index. The value will override any previous setting for that configuration option.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable PvP Mode
    code: World::instance()->setBoolConfig(WORLD_PVP_ENABLED, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable GM Ticket System
    code: World::instance()->setBoolConfig(WORLD_GM_TICKET_SYSTEM, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the configuration in-memory and does not persist changes
    to disk. Any modifications made using setBoolConfig will be lost when the server
    shuts down unless saved through other persistence mechanisms. The method is thread-safe
    for concurrent access, but it's recommended to synchronize updates if multiple
    threads are modifying configurations simultaneously.
  warnings: Modifying certain configuration values at runtime may have unintended
    consequences on gameplay or server stability. For example, disabling critical
    systems like the GM ticket system might prevent administrators from handling player
    issues. Always ensure that configuration changes align with your server's intended
    behavior and security policies.
