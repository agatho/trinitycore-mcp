  signature: void EvokerAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for the evoker's abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown timers for an evoker AI character. This method is typically
    called during each AI update cycle to ensure that spell cooldowns are properly
    tracked and that abilities become available when their cooldown periods expire.
    It handles the decrementing of cooldown timers based on the time elapsed since
    the last update, and may trigger state changes or ability availability updates
    as cooldowns complete. The method is integral to maintaining proper evoker gameplay
    mechanics, ensuring that abilities are not used before their cooldowns have expired.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to accurately decrement cooldown timers based on real-time progression.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateCooldowns Call
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Cooldown Logic
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)\n{\n    if (m_cooldownTimer >\
      \ 0)\n        m_cooldownTimer = std::max(0, m_cooldownTimer - diff);\n    \n\
      \    if (m_cooldownTimer <= 0 && m_isAbilityReady)\n    {\n        // Ability\
      \ is now available\n        m_isAbilityReady = false;\n        // Trigger ability\
      \ activation logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    accurate cooldown tracking. The diff parameter must accurately reflect the time
    passed since the last call for proper cooldown calculations. Cooldowns may be
    affected by various game mechanics such as haste buffs or debuffs that modify
    ability timing.
  warnings: Failure to call UpdateCooldowns regularly can result in incorrect ability
    availability and gameplay imbalance. Ensure the diff parameter is correctly calculated
    from the actual time elapsed between updates to maintain accurate cooldown behavior.
