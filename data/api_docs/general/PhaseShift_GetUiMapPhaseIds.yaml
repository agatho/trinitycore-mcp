  class: PhaseShift
  method: GetUiMapPhaseIds
  signature: const int & PhaseShift::GetUiMapPhaseIds() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the UI map phase IDs associated with the current phase shift.
  description: The GetUiMapPhaseIds method returns a constant reference to an integer
    representing the UI map phase IDs for the current phase shift. This value is used
    by the client to determine which phases should be visible in the user interface,
    particularly for map-related displays and quest tracking. The returned value typically
    corresponds to a bitmask or identifier that defines the active phases within the
    player's current phase context. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer containing the UI map phase IDs. This
    value represents the bitmask or identifier of active phases for UI display purposes,
    allowing the client to filter and show relevant map content based on the current
    phase shift.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve UI Map Phase IDs
    code: "const int& uiPhaseIds = phaseShift.GetUiMapPhaseIds();\n// Use uiPhaseIds\
      \ to determine visible phases in UI\nif (uiPhaseIds & 0x1)\n{\n    // Phase\
      \ 1 is active for UI display\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal data member of the PhaseShift
    class. Modifying the value through this reference directly affects the phase shift's
    UI map phase IDs. This method should be called frequently in performance-sensitive
    contexts as it simply returns a cached value without computation.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned integer reference directly, as it may lead
    to unexpected behavior in phase management. The value returned is only valid during
    the lifetime of the PhaseShift object and should not be stored for later use.
