  brief: Handles emergency threat situations for bot characters in the World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore environment
  description: The HandleThreatEmergency method manages critical threat scenarios
    for bot characters, typically invoked when a bot's threat level exceeds predefined
    thresholds or when emergency conditions arise. This method ensures that bots respond
    appropriately to high-threat situations by adjusting their behavior, potentially
    switching targets, initiating defensive actions, or calling for assistance from
    other bots in the group. The implementation likely evaluates current threat levels,
    checks for valid target states, and executes appropriate emergency protocols based
    on bot configuration and group dynamics.

  - title: Basic Emergency Threat Handling
    code: "void MyBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_botThreatManager->IsInEmergencyThreatState())\n    {\n        m_botThreatManager->HandleThreatEmergency();\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot's AI system when emergency
    conditions are detected. It may modify bot behavior temporarily and should not
    be invoked directly unless specifically required for custom AI implementations.
    The method likely interacts with other threat management components such as target
    selection, threat calculation, and group coordination systems.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method outside of the intended AI flow may cause
    unexpected behavior or disrupt normal bot operation. Ensure that emergency conditions
    are properly evaluated before calling this method to avoid unnecessary processing
    overhead.
