  class: BotSpawner
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotSpawner::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot spawner system and prepares it for creating and managing
    AI-controlled player characters.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and resources required
    for the BotSpawner class to function correctly. It typically performs setup operations
    such as loading configuration data, initializing internal data structures, establishing
    connections to necessary systems (like database or AI modules), and validating
    that all prerequisites are met before bot spawning can occur. This method should
    be called once during system startup or when the spawner needs to be reinitialized.
    The method returns true if initialization was successful, or false if any critical
    error occurred during setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot spawner was successfully initialized with all required
    resources and configurations; returns false if initialization failed due to missing
    dependencies, invalid configuration, or other critical errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotSpawner spawner;\nbool success = spawner.Initialize();\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Bot spawner is ready to spawn bots\n    std::cout << \"Bot spawner\
      \ initialized successfully.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to initialize bot spawner.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a BotSpawner
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process might involve database queries, file I/O operations, and
    system resource allocation which could impact performance.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    memory leaks or inconsistent internal states. Ensure that all previous initialization
    state is properly cleaned up before calling this method again.
