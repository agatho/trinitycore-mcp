  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool IBotSpawner::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot spawner is currently enabled and active.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the bot spawner instance is currently
    enabled and capable of spawning bots. This method typically checks internal state
    flags or configuration settings that control whether the spawner should operate.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI and bot systems, this method helps manage the
    lifecycle of automated player characters (bots) by ensuring they are only spawned
    when explicitly enabled. The return value indicates the operational status of
    the spawner without modifying any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot spawner is enabled and can spawn bots, false otherwise.
    This boolean value reflects the current operational state of the spawner instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (spawner->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning logic\n    spawner->SpawnBot();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle disabled spawner case\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot spawner\
      \ is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spawner control methods
    to manage bot lifecycle. It's a read-only operation that does not modify the internal
    state of the spawner, making it safe for frequent calls. The implementation likely
    checks a simple boolean flag or configuration value.
