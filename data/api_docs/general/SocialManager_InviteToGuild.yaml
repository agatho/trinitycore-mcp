  brief: Invites a player to the social manager's guild
  description: The InviteToGuild method attempts to send a guild invitation to the
    specified target player. This method is typically used within the context of World
    of Warcraft's social systems, where players can invite others to join their guild.
    The method checks if the inviter has sufficient permissions and if the target
    player meets the requirements for guild membership. It handles the communication
    between the client and server to facilitate the guild invitation process.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the target player to invite
      to the guild. Must be a valid player instance.
  returns: Returns true if the guild invitation was successfully sent to the target
    player, false otherwise. The method may return false if the target is already
    in a guild, if the inviter lacks proper permissions, or if there are network issues
    during the invitation process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Invitation
    code: "Player* inviter = ...; // Get reference to inviting player\nPlayer* targetPlayer\
      \ = ...; // Get reference to target player\nbool success = inviter->GetSocialManager()->InviteToGuild(targetPlayer);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Handle successful invitation\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Invitation sent successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle failed invitation\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Failed to send invitation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying social manager's state and permissions.
    It assumes that the calling player has appropriate guild membership rights. The
    actual invitation process involves sending packets to the client and may involve
    server-side validation of guild limits and player status.
  warnings: Ensure that the target player pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    repeated or spam invitations might be restricted by server-side anti-spam mechanisms.
