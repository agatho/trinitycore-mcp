  signature: uint32 GroupModel::GetWmoID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the WMO (World Map Object) identifier associated with the group
    model.
  description: The GetWmoID method returns the unique identifier of the World Map
    Object that this GroupModel represents. In the context of TrinityCore and World
    of Warcraft, WMOs are large environmental structures such as buildings, bridges,
    or terrain features that define the visual layout of zones. This identifier is
    used internally by the game engine to reference specific WMO data files and their
    associated properties. The method is typically called during map loading, rendering,
    or collision detection processes where individual group models need to be identified
    or categorized based on their parent WMO.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the World
    Map Object (WMO) that this GroupModel belongs to. This ID corresponds to an entry
    in the game's WMO data tables and is used for lookup operations during rendering
    and collision handling.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving WMO ID for Debug Logging
    code: 'GroupModel* model = ...; // Assume this points to a valid GroupModel

      uint32 wmoId = model->GetWmoID();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("world", "GroupModel belongs to WMO ID: %u", wmoId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using WMO ID for Conditional Rendering Logic
    code: "GroupModel* model = ...;\nuint32 wmoId = model->GetWmoID();\nif (wmoId\
      \ == 12345)\n{\n    // Special handling for specific WMO\n    model->SetRenderFlag(RENDER_FLAG_SPECIAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any expensive operations.
    It directly accesses a cached or stored value within the GroupModel instance.
    The returned WMO ID should be valid and correspond to an existing entry in the
    game's WMO database, otherwise it may indicate an inconsistency in the map data
    loading process.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid GroupModel instance
    may return an unexpected or zero value. Ensure that the GroupModel has been properly
    loaded and initialized before calling GetWmoID to avoid incorrect behavior in
    downstream systems relying on this identifier.
