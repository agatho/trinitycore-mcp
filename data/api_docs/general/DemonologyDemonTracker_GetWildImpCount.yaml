  signature: uint32 DemonologyDemonTracker::GetWildImpCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current count of wild imp demons summoned by a demonology warlock.
  description: The GetWildImpCount method retrieves the number of wild imp demons
    currently active in the game world for a demonology warlock. This count is typically
    used to manage demon summoning mechanics, such as determining how many additional
    imps can be summoned or calculating damage bonuses from multiple imp presence.
    The method operates on internal tracking data within the DemonologyDemonTracker
    class and does not perform any external lookups or calculations. It's designed
    to provide real-time information about the player's current wild imp summoning
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total count of active wild imp demons summoned
    by the warlock. Returns 0 if no wild imps are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 wildImpCount = demonologyTracker->GetWildImpCount();\nif (wildImpCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Apply effects based on number of wild imps\n    ApplyImpDamageBonus(wildImpCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Summoning Limits
    code: "uint32 currentImps = demonologyTracker->GetWildImpCount();\nuint32 maxImps\
      \ = 3; // Example limit\nif (currentImps < maxImps)\n{\n    // Allow summoning\
      \ more imps\n    SummonWildImp();\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Inform player that limit\
      \ reached\n    SendSystemMessage(\"You have reached the maximum number of wild\
      \ imps.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state updates or when checking
    demon summoning abilities. The returned value reflects only wild imp demons and
    does not include other types of demons such as voidwalkers or felguard. The implementation
    relies on internal demon tracking data that gets updated through combat events
    and spell casting.
  warnings: The method assumes that all demon tracking state is properly initialized
    before calling. If called on an uninitialized or invalid DemonologyDemonTracker
    instance, the behavior may be undefined. Additionally, this count does not account
    for temporary removals or despawns of demons during combat, so it should be used
    in conjunction with other state checks for accuracy.
