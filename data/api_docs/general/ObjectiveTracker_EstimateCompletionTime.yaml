  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: EstimateCompletionTime
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::EstimateCompletionTime(ObjectiveState & state)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the estimated time to complete an objective based
    on current progress and tracked state.
  description: The EstimateCompletionTime method computes the projected time remaining
    for a given objective, using the current progress state and historical data. This
    method is typically invoked during objective updates or when displaying time-to-completion
    information to players in the user interface. It analyzes the rate of progress
    and applies game-specific logic to determine how long it will take to reach completion.
    The method modifies the provided ObjectiveState object to reflect the calculated
    estimate, which may be used for UI display purposes or internal tracking mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: Reference to the ObjectiveState object containing current progress
      data and metadata for the objective being estimated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ObjectiveState state;

      // ... populate state with current objective data ...

      ObjectiveTracker tracker;

      tracker.EstimateCompletionTime(state);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on time elapsed and progress
    made. It may cache results or use smoothing algorithms to provide more stable
    estimates over time rather than instantaneous values.
