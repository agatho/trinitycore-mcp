  signature: void GroupCombatStrategy::InitializeTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat triggers for group-based AI behavior in TrinityCore.
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up the trigger conditions that govern
    how a group-based AI strategy responds to various combat scenarios. This method
    is typically called during the initialization phase of a GroupCombatStrategy instance,
    establishing the necessary event listeners and conditional logic required for
    effective group-based tactical decisions. It configures triggers related to target
    selection, threat management, and coordination with other group members during
    combat situations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now active for group combat behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the strategy's initialization
    lifecycle. It typically sets up internal trigger structures that monitor combat
    events such as target changes, health thresholds, and group member status updates.
