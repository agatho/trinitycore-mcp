documentation:
  brief: Returns the string name of a specified group state
  description: The GetStateName method retrieves the human-readable string representation
    of a given GroupState enumeration value. This method is used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to provide descriptive labels for different states that
    a group object can be in during gameplay. The returned string names correspond
    to standard group states such as 'GROUP_STATE_NONE', 'GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE', 'GROUP_STATE_INACTIVE',
    etc., which are used to track and manage group membership, leadership, and synchronization
    status within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the descriptive name of the specified GroupState.
    Returns an empty string if the state value is invalid or unrecognized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupStateMachine stateMachine;

      GroupState currentState = GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE;

      std::string stateName = stateMachine.GetStateName(currentState);

      // stateName will contain "GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug Logging Example
    code: "void LogGroupState(GroupStateMachine& stateMachine, GroupState state) {\n\
      \    std::string name = stateMachine.GetStateName(state);\n    if (!name.empty())\
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"Current group state: %s\", name.c_str());\n \
      \   } else {\n        sLog->outString(\"Unknown group state encountered\");\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging purposes and logging group state
    transitions. It's important to note that the returned strings are not localized
    and will always be in English. The method performs a simple lookup operation,
    making it efficient for frequent calls during game state management.
  warnings: The method assumes valid GroupState enumeration values. Passing invalid
    or out-of-range values may result in empty string returns. Developers should validate
    input parameters before calling this method if the source of the GroupState value
    is uncertain.
