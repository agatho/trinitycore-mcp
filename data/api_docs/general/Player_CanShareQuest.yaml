documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can share a quest with another player.
  description: The CanShareQuest method checks if a player is eligible to share a
    specific quest with another player in the game. This method evaluates various
    conditions including quest requirements, player level restrictions, and quest
    completion status to determine if sharing is allowed. It's commonly used in quest
    system interactions where players need to know if they can pass quests to party
    members or other players. The method returns true if the quest can be shared and
    false otherwise, making it essential for quest handling logic in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can share the specified quest with another player,
    false otherwise. The method evaluates whether the quest meets requirements for
    sharing, including level restrictions and completion status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Sharing Check
    code: "if (player->CanShareQuest(12345)) {\n    // Quest can be shared\n    //\
      \ Perform sharing logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest cannot be shared\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest system logic to determine
    if a player's quest can be shared with party members or other players. The implementation
    involves checking various quest conditions including level requirements, completion
    status, and player restrictions.
  warnings: The method may return false even when the quest appears to be shareable,
    due to specific quest requirements or player level constraints. Developers should
    ensure that quest sharing logic properly handles all possible scenarios.
