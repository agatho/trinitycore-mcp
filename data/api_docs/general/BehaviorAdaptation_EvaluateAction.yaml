    & state, uint32_t action)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the suitability of a specific action for a bot given its current
    state
  description: The EvaluateAction method computes a float value representing how appropriate
    a given action is for a bot with a specified GUID, based on the current game state.
    This evaluation is used by AI systems to determine optimal behavior choices. The
    method takes into account the bot's unique identifier (GUID), its current internal
    state, and the action to be evaluated. It returns a score that typically ranges
    from 0.0 (completely unsuitable) to 1.0 (perfectly suitable), though values outside
    this range may be possible depending on implementation details. The evaluation
    considers factors such as the bot's health, mana, target status, and other relevant
    game conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that is evaluating the action.
      This must be a valid GUID corresponding to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: state
    description: An integer representing the current internal state of the bot. This
      value typically encodes information about the bot's situation, such as combat
      status, health level, or resource availability.
  - name: action
    description: The identifier for the action to be evaluated. This is usually a
      predefined constant or enum value that corresponds to a specific behavior or
      ability in the AI system.
  returns: A float value representing the evaluation score of the action for the specified
    bot and state. Higher values indicate better suitability. The range is typically
    between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means the action is not suitable at all and 1.0
    means it is perfectly suited.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of EvaluateAction
    code: 'float score = behaviorAdaptation.EvaluateAction(12345, 2, ACTION_ATTACK);

      // Returns a float score indicating how suitable ATTACK is for bot with GUID
      12345 in state 2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using EvaluateAction to select best action
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nint currentState =\
      \ GetBotState(botGuid);\nfloat bestScore = -1.0f;\nuint32_t bestAction = 0;\n\
      \nfor (uint32_t action : availableActions)\n{\n    float score = behaviorAdaptation.EvaluateAction(botGuid,\
      \ currentState, action);\n    if (score > bestScore)\n    {\n        bestScore\
      \ = score;\n        bestAction = action;\n    }\n}\n// bestAction now contains\
      \ the most suitable action based on evaluation"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the behavior adaptation system used by TrinityCore's
    AI framework. It should be called frequently during bot decision-making processes
    to ensure dynamic and adaptive behavior. The implementation may cache evaluations
    or use heuristics for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid corresponds to an active bot, as invalid GUIDs might
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The state parameter must represent a valid
    internal state known by the AI system; otherwise, evaluation results will be unreliable.
