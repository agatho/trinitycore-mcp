  class: Creature
  method: SaveRespawnTime
  signature: void Creature::SaveRespawnTime(uint32 forceDelay)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the respawn time for the creature, optionally forcing a specific delay
    before respawn.
  description: The SaveRespawnTime method is responsible for persisting the respawn
    time of a Creature instance to the database. This ensures that when the creature
    is killed and respawns, it does so according to the configured respawn timer.
    The method accepts an optional forceDelay parameter which can override the default
    respawn behavior, allowing developers or game systems to enforce specific respawn
    delays. This functionality is crucial for managing mob spawning in World of Warcraft
    instances and world zones, particularly for bosses or quest-related creatures
    where timing is important. The method typically gets called when a creature dies
    and before it's scheduled to respawn.
  parameters:
  - name: forceDelay
    description: An optional delay value (in seconds) that forces the creature to
      respawn after this specified time, overriding any default respawn timer. If
      set to 0, the default respawn behavior is used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SaveRespawnTime(); // Uses default respawn time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Respawn Delay
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->SaveRespawnTime(300); // Forces respawn after 5 minutes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database to update the creature's
    respawn time. It should only be called when a creature is actually killed and
    about to be removed from the world. The forceDelay parameter allows for dynamic
    control of respawn timing, useful in scripted events or custom game mechanics.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context (e.g., outside of a creature
    death sequence) may result in incorrect respawn behavior or database inconsistencies.
    Ensure that the creature is properly marked as dead before calling this method.
