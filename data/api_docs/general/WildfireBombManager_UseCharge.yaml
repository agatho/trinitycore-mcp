documentation:
  brief: Reduces the charge count of a wildfire bomb by one.
  description: The UseCharge method is responsible for decrementing the internal charge
    counter of a WildfireBombManager instance. This method is typically invoked when
    a wildfire bomb is activated or used in-game, signifying that one charge has been
    consumed. The method likely performs validation to ensure that the charge count
    does not drop below zero and may trigger additional game logic such as spell effects
    or object destruction when charges are depleted. It serves as a core component
    in managing the usage lifecycle of wildfire bombs within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'WildfireBombManager bombManager;

      bombManager.UseCharge();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid WildfireBombManager instances.
    It is assumed that the manager maintains an internal state tracking the number
    of charges available, and this method modifies that state directly.
  warnings: Calling this method on a manager with zero charges may lead to undefined
    behavior or errors if not properly validated beforehand. Ensure proper charge
    management logic exists in the calling code.
