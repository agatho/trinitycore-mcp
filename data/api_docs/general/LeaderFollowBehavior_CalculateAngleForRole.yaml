  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: CalculateAngleForRole
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::CalculateAngleForRole(int role, int index,
    int total)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the angular position for a follower based on their role, index,
    and total count in a group.
  description: The CalculateAngleForRole method determines the angular offset (in
    radians) that a follower should maintain relative to the leader when following
    in a group formation. This method is typically used in AI behaviors to ensure
    proper positioning of group members during movement or combat. The calculation
    considers the role of the follower (e.g., primary tank, healer, damage dealer),
    their index within the group, and the total number of followers. It returns a
    float value representing the angle in radians, which can be used to compute the
    follower's position around the leader.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: An integer identifier representing the role of the follower in the
      group (e.g., 0 for main tank, 1 for healer, 2 for damage dealer). Valid values
      are typically defined by the game's AI system and may vary based on implementation.
  - name: index
    description: The position index of this follower within the group, starting from
      0. For example, if there are 4 followers, valid indices are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
  - name: total
    description: The total number of followers in the group. Must be a positive integer
      greater than zero.
  returns: A float value representing the angular offset in radians that the follower
    should maintain relative to the leader. Positive values indicate counter-clockwise
    rotation, while negative values indicate clockwise rotation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float angle = behavior.CalculateAngleForRole(1, 0, 3); // Calculates angle
      for first healer in a group of 3 members
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < totalFollowers; ++i)\n{\n    float angle = behavior.CalculateAngleForRole(role,\
      \ i, totalFollowers);\n    // Use angle to calculate follower's position around\
      \ the leader\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI system designed for group movement in
    World of Warcraft. The exact angular calculations may depend on internal constants
    or configuration settings within TrinityCore. It assumes that roles and indices
    are properly validated before calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'total' parameter is greater than zero to avoid division
    by zero errors. The method does not validate role or index values beyond basic
    type constraints, so invalid inputs may lead to unexpected angular positions.
