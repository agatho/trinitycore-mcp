  method: SetQuestSlotEndTime
  signature: void Player::SetQuestSlotEndTime(uint16 slot, time_t endTime)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the end time for a quest slot in the player's quest log.
  description: This method updates the end time of a specific quest slot in the player's
    quest log, allowing developers to control when a quest will become available again.
    The method is typically used during quest completion or when resetting quest timers.
    It affects the quest cooldown period and can influence player progression. The
    slot parameter represents the quest slot index, while the endTime parameter specifies
    when the quest should expire.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index to update, ranging from 0-63. This corresponds
      to a specific quest in the player's quest log.
  - name: endTime
    description: The time when the quest should expire, expressed as a Unix timestamp.
      This value determines when the quest becomes available again.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting quest slot end time
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetQuestSlotEndTime(0, time(NULL) + 3600); // Set quest to expire in
      1 hour'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's quest log data and should be used
    carefully. It does not trigger any client-side updates or notifications; it only
    affects internal game state. The method is typically called during quest completion
    or when resetting quest timers.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause quest cooldown issues, leading to
    quests appearing unavailable when they should be available. Care must be taken
    to ensure the end time is properly set to avoid conflicts with other quest mechanics.
