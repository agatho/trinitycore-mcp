  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: ManageThreatMeters
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::ManageThreatMeters(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Manages threat meters for all members of a group within a dungeon environment.
  description: The ManageThreatMeters method is responsible for updating and maintaining
    threat tracking data for all players in a specified group during dungeon encounters.
    This method ensures that each player's threat level is accurately recorded and
    synchronized with the group's overall threat dynamics, which is crucial for proper
    mob aggro management and encounter mechanics. The function likely iterates through
    all group members, evaluates their current threat contributions, and updates internal
    threat meters accordingly to maintain accurate combat state tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose threat meters
      need to be managed. Must not be null and should represent a valid dungeon group
      with active members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* player\
      \ = sObjectAccessor->FindConnectedPlayer(m_playerGuid))\n    {\n        Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n        if (group && group->isInDungeon())\n\
      \        {\n            m_dungeonBehavior.ManageThreatMeters(group);\n     \
      \   }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during dungeon encounter updates and should
    be invoked regularly to maintain accurate threat tracking. The implementation
    likely involves iterating through group members and updating their individual
    threat values based on combat actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is valid and contains active players before
    calling this method, as passing a null or empty group could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
