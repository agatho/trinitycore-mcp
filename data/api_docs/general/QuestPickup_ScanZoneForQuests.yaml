api:
  class: QuestPickup
  method: ScanZoneForQuests
  signature: void QuestPickup::ScanZoneForQuests(Player * bot, uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Scans the specified zone for available quests and updates the player's quest
    log accordingly.
  description: The ScanZoneForQuests method is responsible for identifying and adding
    any quests that are available in a given zone to the player's quest log. This
    method typically gets invoked when a player enters a new zone or when the system
    needs to refresh the list of active quests in the current area. It ensures that
    players can see and interact with quests relevant to their location, which is
    fundamental to the progression and engagement within World of Warcraft's questing
    system. The method operates on the player object and the zone identifier to determine
    which quests should be made available.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the quest scan. This player's quest log will be updated with newly discovered
      quests.
  - name: zoneId
    description: Unique identifier for the zone to be scanned. This ID corresponds
      to a specific area in the game world where quests are checked and potentially
      added to the player's quest log.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Scan
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 zoneId = 1234; // Example zone ID

      QuestPickup::ScanZoneForQuests(player, zoneId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scanning Current Zone
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 currentZoneId = player->GetZoneId();

      QuestPickup::ScanZoneForQuests(player, currentZoneId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database or internal quest system to
    fetch available quests for a given zone. It may also trigger updates to the player's
    UI to reflect newly added quests. Performance-wise, it should be used judiciously
    during zone transitions to avoid lag.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Calling with an invalid zoneId might lead to unexpected behavior or no
    quests being added to the quest log.
