documentation:
  brief: Teaches the pet a higher rank spell from the same spell line.
  description: The learnSpellHighRank method allows a pet to learn a higher-ranked
    version of an existing spell that it already knows. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's pet system where pets can upgrade their spells as they
    gain levels or through specific game mechanics. The method will find the next
    available rank of the specified spell and teach it to the pet, replacing the previous
    rank if applicable. It does not validate whether the spell is actually learnable
    by the pet type or class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Teach a pet a higher rank of Fireball
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->learnSpellHighRank(133);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the spell ID provided is valid and that a higher rank
    exists for the spell. It may not perform any action if no higher rank is available
    or if the pet already knows the highest rank.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method corresponds to a spell
    that actually has multiple ranks in the game. Using an invalid spell ID might
    result in unexpected behavior or no effect.
