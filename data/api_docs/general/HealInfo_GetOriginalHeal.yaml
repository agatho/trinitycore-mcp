  method: GetOriginalHeal
  signature: uint32 HealInfo::GetOriginalHeal() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the original heal amount before any modifications or multipliers
    are applied.
  description: The GetOriginalHeal method retrieves the base healing value that was
    initially calculated for a heal effect, prior to any adjustments such as critical
    strikes, overhealing reductions, or spell modifiers. This value represents the
    raw heal amount before game mechanics like healing multipliers, buffs, or debuffs
    have been factored in. The method is typically used in conjunction with HealInfo
    objects which store detailed information about healing events in World of Warcraft's
    combat system. It allows developers to access the unmodified heal value for logging,
    analysis, or custom gameplay logic that requires the original heal calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the original heal amount before any modifications
    were applied. This is the base healing value calculated from spell power, talent
    bonuses, and other factors before critical strike multipliers or overhealing adjustments
    are considered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Heal Event Handler
    code: "void OnHealEvent(HealInfo* healInfo)\n{\n    uint32 originalHeal = healInfo->GetOriginalHeal();\n\
      \    // Log or process the original heal amount\n    sLog->outString(\"Original\
      \ heal amount: %u\", originalHeal);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Original vs Actual Heal
    code: "void AnalyzeHealEffect(HealInfo* healInfo)\n{\n    uint32 original = healInfo->GetOriginalHeal();\n\
      \    uint32 actual = healInfo->GetHeal();\n    \n    if (original != actual)\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Heal was modified: Original=%u, Actual=%u\"\
      , original, actual);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the HealInfo class which is used extensively in TrinityCore's
    combat system to track healing events. The returned value represents the heal
    amount before any game mechanics such as critical strike chance, healing over
    time effects, or raid buff multipliers are applied. Developers should be aware
    that this value may differ significantly from the final healed amount due to various
    modifiers and conditions in the game.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method for balance calculations or damage
    mitigation systems, as it only returns the pre-modification heal amount. The actual
    healing received by a target will typically be different due to critical strikes,
    overhealing limits, and other game mechanics that modify the original heal value
    after this method is called.
