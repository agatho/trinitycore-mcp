  method: LoadPaths
  signature: void WaypointMgr::LoadPaths()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all waypoint paths from the database into memory for use by creatures.
  description: The LoadPaths method initializes and loads all creature waypoint paths
    stored in the database into the WaypointMgr's internal data structures. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when waypoint data needs to be refreshed.
    It retrieves path data including waypoints, movement types, and associated creature
    IDs, then organizes them for efficient access during creature AI processing. The
    loaded paths are used by the AI system to control creature movement along predefined
    routes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeWaypoints()\n{\n    sWaypointMgr->LoadPaths();\n\
      \    // Waypoint paths are now loaded and ready for creature AI\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database queries to fetch all waypoint data, which may
    cause a temporary performance impact during server startup. The loaded paths are
    cached in memory and remain available until explicitly cleared or reloaded. This
    method should only be called once per server session unless path data has been
    modified externally.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without clearing previous data may
    result in duplicate waypoint entries. It should not be invoked during active gameplay
    sessions as it may disrupt ongoing creature movements. The method assumes database
    connectivity is established before execution.
