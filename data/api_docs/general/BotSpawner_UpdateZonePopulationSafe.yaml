  class: BotSpawner
  method: UpdateZonePopulationSafe
  signature: void BotSpawner::UpdateZonePopulationSafe(uint32 zoneId, uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot population for a specified zone and map in a thread-safe
    manner.
  description: The UpdateZonePopulationSafe method is responsible for managing and
    updating the number of bots present in a specific zone on a given map. This function
    ensures that the population count is adjusted according to configured rules or
    game mechanics, such as player density, server load, or bot spawning limits. It
    is designed to be thread-safe, preventing race conditions when multiple threads
    attempt to modify the zone's bot population concurrently. The method likely interacts
    with internal data structures that track active bots per zone and may trigger
    additional logic such as spawning or despawning bots based on current population
    thresholds.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone within the map where bot population
      needs to be updated. This ID corresponds to a specific geographic area in the
      game world.
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map on which the specified zone exists.
      Used to ensure correct context for zone-based operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotSpawner spawner;

      spawner.UpdateZonePopulationSafe(1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in a Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterZone(Player* player, uint32 zoneId, uint32 mapId) {\n\
      \    BotSpawner spawner;\n    spawner.UpdateZonePopulationSafe(zoneId, mapId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be called from within a thread-safe context or
    by systems that already handle synchronization. It may internally lock critical
    sections to prevent concurrent modifications to bot population data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper synchronization in a multi-threaded
    environment could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state. Ensure that any
    external calls are made with appropriate locking mechanisms if necessary.
