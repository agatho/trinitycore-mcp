  method: StartLeaderOfflineTimer
  signature: void Group::StartLeaderOfflineTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Starts the leader offline timer for the group, which tracks how long the
    group leader has been disconnected from the server.
  description: The StartLeaderOfflineTimer method initiates a timer that monitors
    the duration for which the group leader has been offline. This functionality is
    crucial for managing group dynamics in World of Warcraft, particularly when the
    leader disconnects or logs out. The timer helps determine whether the group should
    automatically disband or transfer leadership to another member based on server
    configuration and game rules. This method is typically invoked internally by the
    TrinityCore framework upon detecting a leader's disconnection event.

  examples:
  - title: Triggering the leader offline timer
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n    group->StartLeaderOfflineTimer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core when a group leader
    disconnects. Developers should not need to manually invoke this unless implementing
    custom group management logic. The timer duration and behavior are configurable
    via server settings.
  warnings: Invoking this method manually without proper checks may lead to unexpected
    group state changes or incorrect leadership transitions. Ensure that only valid
    group leaders trigger this function.
