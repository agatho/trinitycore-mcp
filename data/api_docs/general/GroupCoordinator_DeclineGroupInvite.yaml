api:
  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: DeclineGroupInvite
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::DeclineGroupInvite(Player * inviter)
documentation:
  brief: Declines a group invitation from a specified player.
  description: The DeclineGroupInvite method removes a player from the group invitation
    list, effectively rejecting an invite sent by the specified inviter. This method
    is typically called when a player chooses not to join a group that has been offered
    to them. The operation ensures that the inviting player is notified of the decline
    and that the invited player's group state is updated accordingly. It handles internal
    group coordination logic to maintain consistency in the game's group management
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: inviter
    description: Pointer to the Player object who sent the group invitation. Must
      be a valid player instance or the method will fail.
  returns: Returns true if the decline was successfully processed and the invitation
    was removed from the system, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate
    that no active invite exists from the specified inviter or that the operation
    failed due to invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Decline a group invite
    code: "Player* inviter = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));\n\
      if (inviter)\n{\n    GroupCoordinator* coordinator = player->GetGroupCoordinator();\n\
      \    if (coordinator && coordinator->DeclineGroupInvite(inviter))\n    {\n \
      \       // Successfully declined the group invite\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Group invite declined.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group coordination system and should
    only be called when a player intends to reject an invitation. It does not directly
    send messages to players; it simply updates the internal state of the group invitation.
  warnings: Ensure that the inviter parameter is a valid Player object before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method assumes that the player has an active group invite from the specified
    inviter.
