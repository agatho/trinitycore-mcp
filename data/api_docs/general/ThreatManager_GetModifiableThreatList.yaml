  class: ThreatManager
  method: GetModifiableThreatList
  signature: int ThreatManager::GetModifiableThreatList()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current threat list for the target unit.
  description: This method retrieves the modifiable threat list from the ThreatManager,
    which contains all the units that have generated threat against the current target.
    The returned value represents the number of entries in the threat list, allowing
    developers to determine how many mobs or players are actively engaged with the
    target unit. This is particularly useful for managing combat behavior and understanding
    the dynamics of threat generation within the game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of entries in the current threat
    list. A value of 0 indicates no threat exists, while positive values indicate
    the presence of threat entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat List Retrieval
    code: "int threatCount = threatManager->GetModifiableThreatList();\nif (threatCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Handle active threat\n    // Do something with the threat\
      \ list\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other threat management
    functions to determine combat status. The returned value can be used to assess
    whether a unit has generated threat against the target, which affects combat behavior
    and AI decision making.
  warnings: Improper handling of this return value may lead to incorrect combat decisions
    or AI behavior. Developers should ensure proper validation before using the returned
    value in calculations.
