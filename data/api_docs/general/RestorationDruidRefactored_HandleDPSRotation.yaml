documentation:
  brief: Executes the specified damage-per-second rotation for a Restoration Druid
    character in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleDPSRotation method manages and applies the appropriate spell
    casting sequence for a Restoration Druid when in a DPS role. This function evaluates
    the current combat state, player resources such as mana and rage, and enemy health
    to determine optimal spell usage. It integrates with TrinityCore's AI system to
    ensure proper rotation execution during encounters. The method is typically invoked
    by the AI subsystem during active combat scenarios where the druid needs to switch
    from healing to damage-dealing mode.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n \
      \   {\n        restorationDruid->HandleDPSRotation();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the druid is already in combat and has appropriate
    target selection. The implementation may vary based on the specific encounter
    type and difficulty level. It's recommended to check if the druid is in a valid
    combat state before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat or without a valid target may lead
    to unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that all necessary preconditions are
    met before invoking the rotation handler.
