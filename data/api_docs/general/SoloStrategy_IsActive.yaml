  class: SoloStrategy
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool SoloStrategy::IsActive(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the solo strategy is currently active for the specified
    bot AI instance.
  description: The IsActive method checks if a given SoloStrategy is currently enabled
    or applicable for a specific BotAI instance. This method evaluates internal conditions
    and state flags to determine if the strategy should be considered active within
    the context of the AI's current behavior. It typically serves as a predicate function
    used by the AI system to decide which strategies to apply during decision-making
    processes. The method does not modify any state but returns a boolean value indicating
    the activation status of the strategy.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the solo strategy is currently active for the provided
    BotAI instance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (strategy->IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Execute solo strategy logic\n   \
      \ ai->DoAction(SOLO_ACTION);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (soloStrategy.IsActive(this)) {\n    \
      \    // Apply solo-specific behavior\n        HandleSoloCombat();\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Fall back to group behavior\n        HandleGroupCombat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    should be considered. The method relies on internal state tracking and may depend
    on other AI components or configuration settings.
