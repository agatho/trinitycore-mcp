  method: SetGroupInvite
  signature: void Player::SetGroupInvite(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the group invite for a player, allowing them to join a group.
  description: This method assigns a group to a player's invitation, enabling them
    to accept or reject group invites. It is used internally by the game system when
    a player is invited to join a group. The method ensures that the player's group
    invite is properly set and that the group member count is updated accordingly.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper group mechanics in World
    of Warcraft, particularly during raid and dungeon instances.

  - title: Basic Group Invite Assignment
    code: 'Group* group = new Group();

      Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetGroupInvite(group);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly handle the invitation process itself, but rather
    sets the group invite for a player. The actual invitation process involves sending
    an invitation message to the player and handling their response. Implementation
    details include proper group member tracking and ensuring that the player's group
    invite is correctly updated.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually being invited
    to join a group, not during general gameplay operations. Incorrect usage may lead
    to invalid group states or unexpected behavior in group mechanics.
