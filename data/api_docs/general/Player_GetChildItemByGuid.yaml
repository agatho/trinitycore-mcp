documentation:
  brief: Returns the item associated with a specific GUID from the player's inventory.
  description: This method retrieves an item from the player's inventory based on
    a given GUID. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft development to access specific
    items within the player's bag or equipment slots. The method returns a pointer
    to the Item object if found, otherwise it returns nullptr. This functionality
    is essential for handling item interactions, quest completion, and various game
    mechanics involving item management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Item object if an item with the specified GUID
    exists in the player's inventory, or nullptr if no such item is found. The returned
    item may be from any inventory slot including bags, equipped items, or other inventory
    locations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetChildItemByGuid(12345);\nif (item)\n{\n    // Item\
      \ found, perform actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods. It's important to note that the GUID parameter refers to the item's unique
    identifier within the game world, not just any arbitrary number. The method may
    return nullptr if the item does not exist or has been removed from the player's
    inventory.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can lead to memory access violations
    if the returned pointer is dereferenced without checking for null. Also, ensure
    that the GUID being passed corresponds to an actual item in the player's inventory
    to avoid unexpected behavior.
