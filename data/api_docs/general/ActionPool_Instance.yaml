documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ActionPool class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the ActionPool
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the pool exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI and action handling
    systems to manage reusable action objects efficiently. The returned reference
    provides access to the global action pool that can be used to allocate and manage
    various game actions such as movement, combat, and spell casting behaviors. The
    singleton ensures thread-safe access to the shared resource while maintaining
    performance through object reuse.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of the ActionPool class. This reference
    provides access to the global action pool that manages reusable action objects
    for AI systems in TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the ActionPool singleton
    code: 'ActionPool& pool = ActionPool::Instance();

      // Use the pool to get or return action objects

      Action* action = pool.GetAction();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ActionPool in AI behavior
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        ActionPool& pool = ActionPool::Instance();\n   \
      \     Action* action = pool.GetAction();\n        if (action) {\n          \
      \  action->Execute(this);\n            pool.ReturnAction(action);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern, meaning multiple calls will return
    references to the same object. The implementation should be thread-safe as TrinityCore's
    AI systems may access it from different threads. The ActionPool is designed for
    performance optimization by reusing action objects instead of creating new ones
    repeatedly.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying the returned instance affects all
    parts of the application that use the pool. Be cautious when implementing custom
    behavior or extending the pool functionality as it may impact other systems using
    the same pool.
