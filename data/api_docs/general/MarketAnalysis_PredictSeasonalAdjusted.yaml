documentation:
  brief: Predicts the seasonal adjusted price of an item in the auction house
  description: The PredictSeasonalAdjusted method calculates and returns a forecasted
    price for a specified item in the auction house, taking into account seasonal
    variations and market trends. This method is typically used by the game's economic
    system to provide dynamic pricing predictions that help players make informed
    decisions about buying or selling items. The prediction considers historical data
    patterns, seasonal demand fluctuations, and current market conditions to generate
    an adjusted price value.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which to predict the price.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  - name: hoursAhead
    description: The number of hours into the future to predict the price. Valid range
      is typically 1-720 hours (30 days).
  returns: Returns a float value representing the predicted seasonal adjusted price
    for the specified item. The value may be zero or negative if prediction fails
    or if the item has no market data available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Price Prediction
    code: float predictedPrice = marketAnalysis->PredictSeasonalAdjusted(18732, 24);
      // Predict price for item ID 18732 24 hours ahead
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Time Frame Analysis
    code: 'float priceIn1Day = marketAnalysis->PredictSeasonalAdjusted(18732, 24);

      float priceIn1Week = marketAnalysis->PredictSeasonalAdjusted(18732, 168);

      printf("Price in 1 day: %.2f, Price in 1 week: %.2f\n", priceIn1Day, priceIn1Week);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires access to historical auction data and seasonal market
    patterns. The accuracy of predictions may vary based on the availability and quality
    of historical data for the specific item. Performance may be impacted when processing
    items with limited historical trading data.
  warnings: The prediction values are estimates only and may not reflect actual market
    conditions. Using these predictions for in-game economic decisions should be done
    with caution as real-time market fluctuations can significantly impact actual
    prices.
