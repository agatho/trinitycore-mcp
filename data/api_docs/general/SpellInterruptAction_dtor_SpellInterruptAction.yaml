  brief: Destroys a SpellInterruptAction object and releases its resources
  description: The SpellInterruptAction destructor is responsible for cleaning up
    all resources associated with a spell interrupt action. This includes releasing
    any allocated memory, canceling pending operations, and ensuring proper cleanup
    of internal data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system, this
    destructor ensures that when a spell interrupt action is no longer needed, it
    properly terminates without leaving dangling references or memory leaks. The method
    is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of SpellInterruptAction
    code: 'SpellInterruptAction* action = new SpellInterruptAction();

      // ... use the action ...

      delete action; // Triggers ~SpellInterruptAction()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process
    ensures all internal references are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks.
