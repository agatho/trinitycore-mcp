documentation:
  brief: Adds a new battle pet to the player's collection with specified attributes.
  description: The AddPet method creates and registers a new battle pet in the player's
    collection. It accepts parameters defining the pet's species, display ID, breed,
    quality, and level. This method is typically used during pet acquisition events
    such as quest rewards, vendor purchases, or world events. The pet will be added
    to the player's active battle pet roster and can be used in pet battles once registered.
    The method does not validate whether the player already owns a pet of the same
    species; it simply adds a new instance.
  parameters:
  - name: species
    description: The unique identifier for the pet species. Determines the pet's visual
      appearance, abilities, and type in battle.
  - name: display
    description: The display ID used to render the pet in the UI and world. This may
      differ from the species ID for cosmetic variations.
  - name: breed
    description: The breed of the pet, which affects its stats and abilities. Valid
      values are typically 0-3 representing different breed types.
  - name: quality
    description: The quality level of the pet, determining its rarity and stat modifiers.
      Should be a value from BattlePetBreedQuality enum (e.g., Common, Rare, Epic).
  - name: level
    description: The initial level of the pet, which affects its base stats. Must
      be between 1 and 25 inclusive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Add a Common Battle Pet
    code: battlePetMgr->AddPet(1234, 5678, 0, BattlePetBreedQuality::Common, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Add a Rare Battle Pet at Level 10
    code: battlePetMgr->AddPet(9876, 4321, 2, BattlePetBreedQuality::Rare, 10);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player has sufficient space in their battle pet collection.
    If the collection is full, the behavior may vary depending on implementation details.
    The method does not trigger any visual updates or notifications to the client;
    additional logic may be required to refresh UI elements.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are within valid ranges before calling this
    method. Invalid species or quality values may cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    The level parameter must be a positive integer between 1 and 25, inclusive.
