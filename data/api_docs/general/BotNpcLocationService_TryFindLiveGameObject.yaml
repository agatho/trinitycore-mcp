  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: TryFindLiveGameObject
  signature: NpcLocationResult BotNpcLocationService::TryFindLiveGameObject(Player
    * bot, uint32 objectEntry, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to locate a live game object near the specified bot within the given
    range.
  description: The TryFindLiveGameObject method searches for a GameObject with the
    specified entry ID near the provided bot player. It scans the area around the
    bot up to the maximum range specified, returning a result that indicates whether
    an object was found and its location. This method is typically used by AI systems
    or bot controllers to locate interactable objects such as chests, doors, or quest
    items in the game world. The search respects the game's spatial and visibility
    constraints, ensuring only valid, visible, and accessible objects are returned.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be used
      as the reference point for searching nearby game objects.
  - name: objectEntry
    description: The entry ID of the GameObject to search for. This corresponds to
      the 'entry' field in the game's database tables like 'gameobject_template'.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) from the bot within which to search for
      the specified game object.
  returns: Returns a NpcLocationResult structure that contains information about whether
    an object was found, and if so, its location. The result may indicate success
    or failure, along with coordinates or GUID of the located object.
  examples:
  - title: Find a nearby treasure chest
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized\nuint32 chestEntry = 176543; //\
      \ Example chest entry ID\nfloat range = 10.0f;\nNpcLocationResult result = BotNpcLocationService::TryFindLiveGameObject(bot,\
      \ chestEntry, range);\nif (result.found)\n{\n    // Use result.location to move\
      \ or interact with the object\n    sLog->outString(\"Found treasure chest at:\
      \ %f, %f, %f\", result.location.x, result.location.y, result.location.z);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial search using the bot's current position and
    the specified range. It is optimized for performance but may be affected by server-side
    object visibility rules or map boundaries. The NpcLocationResult structure should
    be checked for validity before using its contents.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player pointer is valid and not null, as passing a
    null reference will likely lead to undefined behavior. Also, the maxRange parameter
    should be reasonable to avoid excessive server load from large searches.
