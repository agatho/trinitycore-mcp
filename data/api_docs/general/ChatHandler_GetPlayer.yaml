documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Player object associated with the current chat handler context
  description: The GetPlayer method returns a pointer to the Player object that is
    currently associated with the ChatHandler instance. This method is typically used
    in command implementations where access to the player's data, state, or properties
    is required. The returned pointer may be null if no player is associated with
    the chat handler, which can happen in certain administrative or server-side contexts.
    In most command implementations, this method will successfully return a valid
    Player pointer since commands are usually invoked by players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object if one is associated with the ChatHandler
    context, or nullptr if no player is available
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in command implementation
    code: "void HandleTestCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    Player* player = handler->GetPlayer();\n\
      \    if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Hello,\
      \ %s!\", player->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing player data after validation
    code: "bool HandleTeleportCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    Player* player\
      \ = handler->GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return false;\n    \n \
      \   // Access player's position\n    float x = player->GetPositionX();\n   \
      \ float y = player->GetPositionY();\n    float z = player->GetPositionZ();\n\
      \    \n    handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Current position: %.2f, %.2f, %.2f\",\
      \ x, y, z);\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in command implementations where the command
    context needs to access player-specific data. The returned Player pointer should
    always be validated for null before use, as commands can sometimes be invoked
    from non-player contexts such as console or administrative commands.
  warnings: Always check if the returned pointer is null before dereferencing it.
    Some server commands may not have an associated player context, particularly those
    executed through the console or administrative interfaces.
