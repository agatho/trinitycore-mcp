  method: CalculateSimilarity
  signature: float PatternSignature::CalculateSimilarity(const int & other) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the similarity score between this pattern signature
    and another pattern signature.
  description: The CalculateSimilarity method computes a floating-point similarity
    score between the current PatternSignature object and another PatternSignature
    object represented by the input parameter. This score typically ranges from 0.0
    (completely dissimilar) to 1.0 (identical), though values outside this range may
    be possible depending on implementation details. The method is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for pattern matching, such as identifying similar
    mob behaviors, spell patterns, or quest progression sequences. It performs a comparison
    based on internal signature data structures and returns a normalized similarity
    value that reflects how closely the two patterns align.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: A reference to another PatternSignature object used for comparison.
      This parameter represents the pattern against which the current object's signature
      is compared to determine similarity.
  returns: A float value representing the similarity score between this PatternSignature
    and the provided 'other' PatternSignature. Values typically range from 0.0 (no
    similarity) to 1.0 (identical patterns), but may exceed these bounds depending
    on internal implementation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PatternSignature sig1;

      PatternSignature sig2;

      float similarity = sig1.CalculateSimilarity(sig2);

      // similarity will be a value between 0.0 and 1.0

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Similarity for Behavior Matching
    code: "PatternSignature playerPattern;\nPatternSignature npcPattern;\nfloat matchScore\
      \ = playerPattern.CalculateSimilarity(npcPattern);\nif (matchScore > 0.8f) {\n\
      \    // High similarity detected - likely same behavior pattern\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI-driven behavior systems within TrinityCore,
    where pattern signatures are compared to identify similar actions or sequences.
    The performance of this method may vary depending on the complexity of the internal
    signature structures being compared. It's recommended to cache results when comparing
    the same patterns multiple times to avoid redundant computations.
  warnings: Ensure that both PatternSignature objects are properly initialized before
    calling this method, as uninitialized or corrupted pattern data could lead to
    unpredictable similarity scores. Be cautious when using values outside the expected
    0.0-1.0 range, as they may indicate internal inconsistencies in the pattern data.
