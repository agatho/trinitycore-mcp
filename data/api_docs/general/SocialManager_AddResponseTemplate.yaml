documentation:
  brief: Adds a response template to the social manager's collection of available
    responses.
  description: The AddResponseTemplate method is used to register a new response template
    within the SocialManager class. This functionality allows for dynamic addition
    of predefined responses that can be used in social interactions, such as friend
    requests, guild invitations, or general chat communications. The method takes
    a const reference to a ResponseTemplate object and incorporates it into an internal
    collection. This enables the system to provide standardized replies based on various
    social triggers without requiring hard-coded strings throughout the codebase.
    The addition of response templates enhances modularity and maintainability of
    social interaction logic.
  parameters:
  - name: response
    description: A const reference to a ResponseTemplate object containing the template
      data to be added to the social manager's collection. This includes the response
      content, type identifier, and any associated metadata.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Basic Response Template
    code: 'ResponseTemplate template;

      template.type = RESPONSE_TYPE_FRIEND_REQUEST;

      template.content = "I''d be happy to accept your friend request!";

      SocialManager::AddResponseTemplate(template);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a Custom Response Template with Metadata
    code: 'ResponseTemplate customTemplate;

      customTemplate.type = RESPONSE_TYPE_GUILD_INVITE;

      customTemplate.content = "Thanks for the invite! I''ll join your guild shortly.";

      customTemplate.metadata = {"category", "guild"};

      SocialManager::AddResponseTemplate(customTemplate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during server initialization or runtime configuration
    when new social response behaviors need to be introduced. The internal storage
    of templates may use hash maps or similar data structures for efficient lookup
    by type. Developers should ensure that the ResponseTemplate objects passed are
    properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Adding duplicate response types may overwrite existing templates, potentially
    causing unexpected behavior in social interactions. Ensure that response templates
    have unique identifiers to prevent unintended overwrites.
