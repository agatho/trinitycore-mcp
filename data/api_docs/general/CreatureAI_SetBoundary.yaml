  class: CreatureAI
  method: SetBoundary
  signature: void CreatureAI::SetBoundary(const CreatureBoundary * boundary, bool
    negativeBoundaries)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the boundary limits for a creature's AI movement.
  description: The SetBoundary method configures the spatial boundaries within which
    a CreatureAI-controlled creature can move. This is used to restrict the creature's
    patrol or roaming behavior to specific areas, preventing it from wandering outside
    designated zones. The method accepts a pointer to a CreatureBoundary structure
    that defines these limits, and a boolean flag indicating whether negative boundaries
    should be applied. When negative boundaries are enabled, the creature will avoid
    areas defined by the boundary rather than being confined to them. This functionality
    is commonly used for creating AI behaviors that respect map constraints or scripted
    movement patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: boundary
    description: Pointer to a CreatureBoundary structure defining the spatial limits
      for the creature's movement. This structure typically contains coordinates or
      area definitions that constrain where the creature can move.
  - name: negativeBoundaries
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether negative boundaries should be applied.
      If true, the creature will avoid areas defined by the boundary rather than being
      confined to them. If false, the creature is restricted to the defined boundary
      area.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Positive Boundary for Creature
    code: 'CreatureBoundary boundary;

      boundary.minX = 100.0f;

      boundary.maxX = 200.0f;

      boundary.minY = 150.0f;

      boundary.maxY = 250.0f;

      creature->GetAI()->SetBoundary(&boundary, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Negative Boundary to Avoid Area
    code: 'CreatureBoundary boundary;

      boundary.minX = 300.0f;

      boundary.maxX = 400.0f;

      boundary.minY = 350.0f;

      boundary.maxY = 450.0f;

      creature->GetAI()->SetBoundary(&boundary, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The CreatureBoundary structure should be properly initialized before passing
    to this method. The boundary coordinates are typically in world space coordinates
    and may be affected by the creature's current map and instance settings. This
    method does not immediately enforce the boundary - it sets up the constraints
    that will be checked during movement updates.
  warnings: Setting invalid or improperly configured boundaries can cause unexpected
    behavior or movement issues. Ensure that boundary coordinates are within valid
    map limits and that negative boundaries are used appropriately to avoid unintended
    avoidance behaviors.
