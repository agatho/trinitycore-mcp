documentation:
  brief: Returns the permanent bonus value for a specified skill.
  description: This method retrieves the permanent bonus value associated with a specific
    skill for the player. The skill is identified by its unique identifier, and the
    method returns an integer16 value representing the bonus. This is typically used
    in conjunction with skill-related calculations to determine how much additional
    benefit a player receives from various sources such as talent points or other
    game mechanics. The method does not modify any internal state but simply reads
    from existing data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the permanent bonus value for the specified
    skill, expressed as an int16 (signed 16-bit integer). It can be positive or negative,
    indicating whether the bonus is additive or subtractive respectively. A value
    of zero indicates no permanent bonus exists for that skill.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int16 bonus = player->GetSkillPermBonusValue(129); // Get bonus for Enchanting
      skill
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in game calculations involving skill bonuses,
    particularly when determining the impact of talents or other gameplay elements
    on skill progression. Performance-wise, it should not cause any significant overhead
    as it simply accesses stored data without complex computations.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return zero if no permanent bonus exists
    for the specified skill, which could lead to misinterpretation of game mechanics
    if not handled carefully in code logic.
