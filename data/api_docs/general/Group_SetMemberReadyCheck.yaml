  class: Group
  method: SetMemberReadyCheck
  signature: void Group::SetMemberReadyCheck(MemberSlot * slot, bool ready)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ready check status for a group member.
  description: The SetMemberReadyCheck method updates the ready status of a specific
    group member identified by their slot. This method is typically used during group
    encounters or instances to track whether all members are prepared to proceed.
    The ready check mechanism helps ensure that all players in a group are synchronized
    before advancing through content. The method modifies internal group state and
    may trigger UI updates for affected players.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: Pointer to the MemberSlot structure representing the group member
      whose ready status is being updated.
  - name: ready
    description: Boolean value indicating the ready status. True means the member
      is ready, false means not ready.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a member as ready
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    MemberSlot* slot\
      \ = group->GetMemberSlot(player->GetGUID());\n    if (slot)\n    {\n       \
      \ group->SetMemberReadyCheck(slot, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a member as not ready
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player->GetGUID()))\n\
      {\n    MemberSlot* slot = group->GetMemberSlot(targetPlayer->GetGUID());\n \
      \   if (slot)\n    {\n        group->SetMemberReadyCheck(slot, false);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid group members. The slot parameter
    must not be null. This method may trigger internal synchronization logic that
    updates the ready check status across all group members.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null slot pointer will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the member exists in the group before calling
    this method.
