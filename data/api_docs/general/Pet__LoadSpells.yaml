  brief: Loads and initializes the spell data for a pet from the database result set
  description: The _LoadSpells method is an internal utility function responsible
    for processing spell-related data retrieved from the database for a pet entity.
    It takes a database result set identifier and populates the pet's spell book with
    spells, their levels, and associated metadata. This method is typically invoked
    during pet initialization or loading phases when the creature's spell data needs
    to be reconstructed from persistent storage. The method handles the mapping of
    database records to internal spell structures and ensures that the pet's spell
    capabilities are correctly restored.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Pet Spell Loading During Initialization
    code: "void Pet::LoadFromDB(uint32 petEntry, uint32 petGuid)\n{\n    // ... database\
      \ query logic ...\n    int result = sObjectMgr->GetPetSpellData(petGuid);\n\
      \    _LoadSpells(result);\n    // ... continue initialization ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by external
    code. The method assumes that the database result set contains valid spell data
    for the pet. It's part of a larger pet loading pipeline that includes other methods
    like _LoadSpellCooldowns and _LoadPetStats.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper database initialization or with invalid
    result set identifiers may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method does
    not perform any validation on the input data, so it's crucial that the calling
    code ensures data integrity.
