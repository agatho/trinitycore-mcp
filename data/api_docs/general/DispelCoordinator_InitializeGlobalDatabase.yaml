  signature: void DispelCoordinator::InitializeGlobalDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the global database for dispel coordination functionality.
  description: The InitializeGlobalDatabase method sets up and prepares the global
    database structures required for managing dispel operations within the TrinityCore
    server. This method is typically invoked during server startup or initialization
    phases to ensure that all necessary data structures, tables, and configurations
    are properly loaded and ready for use. It handles the setup of internal mappings,
    caches, and state information needed for tracking and coordinating dispel effects
    across the game world. The method ensures that the dispel coordinator has access
    to all required global data sources before any dispel operations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'DispelCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.InitializeGlobalDatabase();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or data corruption. The method is typically
    invoked internally by the core server initialization process and should not be
    manually called by external systems unless explicitly required for specific custom
    implementations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that all existing dispel operations
    are properly terminated before calling this method again.
