  class: YouJoinedAppend
  method: YouJoinedAppend
  signature: void YouJoinedAppend::YouJoinedAppend(const Channel * channel)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a player to a channel's member list when they join.
  description: The YouJoinedAppend method is responsible for adding a player to the
    internal member list of a chat channel when that player joins the channel. This
    method ensures proper synchronization of channel membership and updates the channel's
    state to reflect the new member. It is typically invoked as part of the channel
    joining process within the TrinityCore framework, maintaining consistency between
    the game server's internal data structures and the player's actual channel participation.
  parameters:
  - name: channel
    description: A pointer to the Channel object representing the chat channel the
      player is joining. This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to an existing
      channel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Joining a Channel
    code: "Channel* myChannel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif\
      \ (myChannel)\n{\n    YouJoinedAppend::YouJoinedAppend(myChannel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore channel management
    system when a player successfully joins a channel. Developers should ensure that
    the channel parameter is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the channel parameter may result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always verify that the channel exists and is valid before
    invoking this method.
