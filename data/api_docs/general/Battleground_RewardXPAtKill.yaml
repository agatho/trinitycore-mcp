  class: Battleground
  method: RewardXPAtKill
  signature: void Battleground::RewardXPAtKill(Player * killer, Player * victim)
documentation:
  brief: Rewards experience points to the killer player upon defeating a victim in
    a battleground.
  description: The RewardXPAtKill method is responsible for granting experience points
    to the player who has killed another player during a battleground match. This
    method ensures that the killer receives appropriate XP based on the game's battleground
    rules and difficulty settings. The method typically handles both the immediate
    XP award and any related updates to the player's experience tracking within the
    battleground context. It may also consider factors such as the victim's level,
    the battleground type, and whether the kill was part of a specific objective or
    flag capture. This function is usually invoked internally by the battleground
    system when a player death occurs during active gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: killer
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player who performed
      the killing blow. Must be a valid player instance within the battleground.
  - name: victim
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player who was killed.
      Must be a valid player instance within the battleground and currently participating
      in the match.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground kill handler
    code: "void Battleground::HandlePlayerKill(Player* killer, Player* victim)\n{\n\
      \    // ... other logic ...\n    RewardXPAtKill(killer, victim);\n    // ...\
      \ continue with other kill handling ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom battleground scoring system
    code: "void CustomBattleground::OnPlayerKilled(Player* killer, Player* victim)\n\
      {\n    // Apply custom XP scaling based on player levels\n    if (killer &&\
      \ victim)\n    {\n        RewardXPAtKill(killer, victim);\n        // Additional\
      \ scoring logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the processing of a player death event
    within a battleground. It assumes both players are valid and participating in
    the current battleground instance. The actual XP awarded may be adjusted based
    on battleground-specific modifiers such as honor points, team bonuses, or difficulty
    settings. This function does not directly modify the victim's state but rather
    awards experience to the killer.
  warnings: Ensure that both killer and victim pointers are valid before calling this
    method; passing null pointers could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The
    method should only be called during active battleground gameplay when both players
    are properly registered in the battleground instance.
