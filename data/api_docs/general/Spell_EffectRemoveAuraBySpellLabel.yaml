  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly impacts spell mechanics
    and may affect player or creature behavior. It is typically invoked during spell
    activation, cooldown handling, or when modifying spell effects dynamically.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in spell effects,
    potentially causing incorrect aura application or removal, especially if used
    without proper context or validation.
