documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PlayerPatternRecognition class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the PlayerPatternRecognition
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global player pattern recognition
    functionality within the TrinityCore server. The returned reference provides access
    to all player pattern recognition features and data structures. This implementation
    is thread-safe and designed to be called from any context within the server's
    execution flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of PlayerPatternRecognition class. This
    reference can be used to access all public methods and members of the class without
    creating additional instances.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing PlayerPatternRecognition Singleton
    code: 'PlayerPatternRecognition& patternRec = PlayerPatternRecognition::Instance();

      // Use patternRec to access pattern recognition functionality

      uint32 playerId = patternRec.GetLastRecognizedPlayerId();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Singleton in Player Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterWorld(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition&\
      \ recognizer = PlayerPatternRecognition::Instance();\n    recognizer.AddPlayerToRecognitionList(player->GetGUID());\n\
      \    // Additional pattern recognition logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application. Developers
    should be aware that this is a global state access point, so excessive use may
    impact testability and maintainability of code.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying shared state through this instance
    can have unintended side effects across different parts of the application. Avoid
    storing references to the singleton instance in long-lived objects as it may lead
    to issues during shutdown or when the singleton itself gets destroyed.
