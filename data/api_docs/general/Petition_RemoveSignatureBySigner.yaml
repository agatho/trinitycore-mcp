  signature: void Petition::RemoveSignatureBySigner(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a signature from a petition by the signer's player GUID.
  description: The RemoveSignatureBySigner method removes a specific signature from
    a petition document based on the provided player GUID. This function is typically
    used when a player revokes their signature from a guild petition or similar in-game
    document. The method ensures that only the correct signature associated with the
    given player GUID is removed, maintaining data integrity for the petition's signature
    list. It operates within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    and is part of the petition system that manages guild and character-related signatures.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose signature should
      be removed from the petition. This value must correspond to a valid player in
      the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Player's Signature
    code: "Petition* petition = sObjectAccessor->GetPetition(12345);\nif (petition)\n\
      {\n    petition->RemoveSignatureBySigner(54321);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures representing the petition's
    signatures and may trigger database synchronization to persist the change. It
    assumes that the petition object is valid and contains the specified signature.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an actual signed player;
    otherwise, calling this method may result in no-op behavior or potential errors
    if not properly validated.
