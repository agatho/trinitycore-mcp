  class: PlayerSkillProfile
  method: RecordAction
  signature: void PlayerSkillProfile::RecordAction(bool successful, float reactionTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records a skill action attempt with its success status and reaction time
    for player skill profiling.
  description: The RecordAction method logs information about a player's skill usage,
    including whether the action was successful and the reaction time taken. This
    data is used to track player performance and skill development over time. The
    method updates internal profiling statistics based on the provided parameters.
    It is typically called during gameplay when a player performs a skill-based action
    such as casting a spell, using an ability, or executing a crafting recipe.
  parameters:
  - name: successful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the skill action was successful (true)
      or failed (false).
  - name: reactionTime
    description: Float value representing the reaction time in seconds from when the
      action was initiated to when it completed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic skill action recording
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      profile->RecordAction(true, 0.3f); // Successful action with 0.3 second reaction
      time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed skill action recording
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      profile->RecordAction(false, 1.2f); // Failed action with 1.2 second reaction
      time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account. The reaction time parameter is expected
    to be measured in seconds and may include latency from client-server communication.
