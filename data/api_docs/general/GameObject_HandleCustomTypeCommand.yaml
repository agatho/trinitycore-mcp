documentation:
  brief: Handles custom type commands for game objects, enabling specific object behaviors
    based on command types.
  description: This method processes custom commands for GameObject instances, allowing
    developers to define specific actions or behaviors for different types of game
    objects. It typically handles commands related to object type-specific functionality,
    such as triggering special events, modifying object states, or executing custom
    logic based on predefined command types. The method operates within the context
    of TrinityCore's game object system and may be used in conjunction with other
    GameObject methods to manage complex interactions between game entities and player
    actions.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      CustomCommand command;

      command.type = CUSTOM_TYPE_QUEST;

      command.data = 12345;

      go->HandleCustomTypeCommand(command);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates in a context where game object commands are processed
    through a command system, potentially involving state management and event handling.
    Implementation may involve checking command types against predefined ranges or
    using virtual functions to handle different command behaviors.
  warnings: Care should be taken when implementing custom commands as they may affect
    game object state or trigger unexpected behavior if not properly validated. The
    method may not be thread-safe and should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments.
