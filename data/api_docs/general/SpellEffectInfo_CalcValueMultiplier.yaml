  class: SpellEffectInfo
  method: CalcValueMultiplier
  signature: float SpellEffectInfo::CalcValueMultiplier(WorldObject * caster, Spell
    * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the value multiplier for a spell effect based on caster
    and spell context.
  description: The CalcValueMultiplier method computes a floating-point multiplier
    that modifies the base value of a spell effect. This multiplier is derived from
    various factors including the caster's properties, spell attributes, and effect-specific
    modifiers. The result directly influences how much damage, healing, or other effects
    are applied when the spell is cast. This method plays a crucial role in determining
    the final outcome of spell effects within the TrinityCore engine, ensuring dynamic
    scaling based on game state and character capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. Typically a
      Player or Creature. Must not be null for valid calculations.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object representing the spell being cast. Must
      not be null and should represent an active spell instance.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated multiplier. This value is typically
    used to scale the base effect value of a spell. Values can range from 0.0 (no
    effect) upwards, with typical values being greater than 1.0 for buffs or enhancements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect Calculation
    code: 'float multiplier = effect.CalcValueMultiplier(caster, spell);

      float finalEffectValue = baseValue * multiplier;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Multiplier for Damage Scaling
    code: 'SpellEffectInfo effect = spell->GetEffect(0);

      float damageMultiplier = effect.CalcValueMultiplier(caster, spell);

      uint32 finalDamage = baseDamage * damageMultiplier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve complex calculations including stat modifiers, aura
    effects, and spell-specific multipliers. It's important to ensure that both caster
    and spell parameters are valid before calling this function to avoid undefined
    behavior. The multiplier returned can be used directly in mathematical operations
    without additional normalization.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for caster or spell will likely
    result in crashes or undefined behavior. Always validate input parameters before
    invoking CalcValueMultiplier. Additionally, the multiplier value may vary depending
    on active auras and temporary modifiers that are applied during spell execution.
