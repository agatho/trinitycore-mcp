  class: QuestPickup
  method: FilterQuests
  signature: int QuestPickup::FilterQuests(const int & questIds, Player * bot, const
    QuestPickupFilter & filter)
documentation:
  brief: Filters a list of quest IDs based on specified criteria for a player bot.
  description: The FilterQuests method processes a collection of quest identifiers
    and applies a given filter to determine which quests are suitable for a specific
    player bot. This function is typically used in AI-driven quest selection logic
    within TrinityCore's scripting system, allowing bots to prioritize or exclude
    quests based on various conditions such as quest level requirements, availability,
    completion status, or player class restrictions. The method returns the count
    of quests that passed the filter criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: questIds
    description: A reference to an integer representing a list of quest identifiers.
      In practice, this is often a bitmask or array of quest IDs that need to be filtered.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the quests
      are being filtered. This player instance determines eligibility based on character
      state and requirements.
  - name: filter
    description: A constant reference to a QuestPickupFilter object that defines the
      filtering rules. The filter specifies conditions such as quest level, faction,
      class restrictions, or completion status that quests must meet to be included
      in the result.
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of quests from the input list that
    satisfied the provided filter criteria. Returns zero if no quests pass the filter.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int filteredCount = bot->GetQuestPickup()->FilterQuests(questIds, bot, filter);
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering for available quests only
    code: 'QuestPickupFilter filter;

      filter.availableOnly = true;

      int count = bot->GetQuestPickup()->FilterQuests(questIds, bot, filter);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the QuestPickup subsystem and is commonly used in
    AI scripts to dynamically select appropriate quests for bots. It assumes that
    quest data is already loaded and accessible via the player's internal quest system.
    Performance may be impacted when filtering large numbers of quests.
  warnings: Ensure that the questIds parameter correctly represents valid quest identifiers,
    as invalid IDs can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect filtering results.
    The filter object must be properly initialized before calling this method.
