  method: LoadDungeonEncounterData
  signature: void InstanceScript::LoadDungeonEncounterData(uint32 bossId, const std::array<uint32,
    MAX_DUNGEON_ENCOUNTERS_PER_BOSS> & dungeonEncounterIds)
documentation:
  brief: Loads dungeon encounter data for a specified boss ID with associated encounter
    IDs.
  description: The LoadDungeonEncounterData method initializes or updates the encounter
    data for a specific dungeon boss within an instance script. This function is typically
    used during instance initialization to register the valid encounters that can
    be tracked for the given boss. It associates a unique boss identifier with an
    array of encounter identifiers, which are used internally by TrinityCore's instance
    management system to track progress and completion states of dungeon encounters.
    The method does not perform any validation on the input data but assumes that
    the provided encounter IDs are valid within the context of the dungeon being loaded.
  parameters:
  - name: bossId
    description: Unique identifier for the boss whose encounter data is being loaded.
      This ID corresponds to a specific boss in the dungeon's encounter system.
  - name: dungeonEncounterIds
    description: An array of up to MAX_DUNGEON_ENCOUNTERS_PER_BOSS unique identifiers
      representing the encounters associated with the specified boss. Each entry in
      the array maps to a distinct encounter phase or event during the boss fight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Load encounter data for a boss with ID 12345\n\
      \        const std::array<uint32, MAX_DUNGEON_ENCOUNTERS_PER_BOSS> encounters\
      \ = { 1001, 1002, 1003 };\n        LoadDungeonEncounterData(12345, encounters);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Encounters
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Dynamically build encounter IDs based on instance\
      \ difficulty or other conditions\n        std::array<uint32, MAX_DUNGEON_ENCOUNTERS_PER_BOSS>\
      \ encounters;\n        encounters[0] = GetEncounterIdForDifficulty(1);\n   \
      \     encounters[1] = GetEncounterIdForDifficulty(2);\n        encounters[2]\
      \ = GetEncounterIdForDifficulty(3);\n        LoadDungeonEncounterData(GetBossId(),\
      \ encounters);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of an instance
    script. Developers should ensure that the bossId and encounter IDs are valid before
    calling this function, as invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior in encounter
    tracking. The MAX_DUNGEON_ENCOUNTERS_PER_BOSS constant defines how many encounters
    can be associated with a single boss, and exceeding this limit may cause data
    corruption or loss.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times for the same bossId will overwrite
    previously loaded encounter data. Ensure that all necessary encounter IDs are
    provided in one call rather than making repeated calls to avoid losing previous
    state information.
