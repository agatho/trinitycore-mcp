documentation:
  brief: Stops all active worker threads managed by the BotPerformanceMonitor instance.
  description: The StopWorkerThreads method is responsible for gracefully shutting
    down and terminating all worker threads that are currently running under the control
    of the BotPerformanceMonitor. This method ensures that any ongoing tasks or monitoring
    activities are properly concluded before the threads are terminated. It typically
    involves signaling the worker threads to exit their execution loops, waiting for
    them to finish processing any pending work, and then safely cleaning up thread
    resources. The method is usually called during system shutdown or when reconfiguring
    performance monitoring settings.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      // ... initialize and start worker threads ...

      monitor.StopWorkerThreads(); // Gracefully stop all worker threads'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after ensuring that no other components
    are actively using the worker threads. It's recommended to call this method before
    destroying the BotPerformanceMonitor instance to avoid potential resource leaks
    or undefined behavior.
