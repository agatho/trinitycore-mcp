  signature: void BotMemoryManager::BotMemoryManager()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotMemoryManager class for managing AI
    bot memory allocations.
  description: The BotMemoryManager constructor initializes the internal data structures
    and resources required for managing memory allocations specific to AI bots in
    the TrinityCore environment. This method sets up necessary tracking mechanisms,
    allocators, and memory pools that allow AI bots to efficiently store and retrieve
    behavioral data, state information, and contextual knowledge during gameplay.
    The initialization process ensures that bot-specific memory management is properly
    configured before any bot instances attempt to utilize these resources.

  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of BotMemoryManager
    code: 'BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      // The constructor automatically initializes all internal memory management
      systems

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when initializing AI bot subsystems. Developers should not manually instantiate
    BotMemoryManager objects unless implementing custom AI components that require
    direct memory management control.
