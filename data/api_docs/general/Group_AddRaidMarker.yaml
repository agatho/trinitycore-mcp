documentation:
  brief: Adds a raid marker to the group's instance
  description: The AddRaidMarker method places a visual marker on the minimap for
    all group members within the same instance. This functionality is used primarily
    for coordinating group activities such as marking locations of interest, objectives,
    or points of interest during raid encounters. The marker is displayed as a colored
    dot on the minimap and can be cleared by removing the marker or leaving the instance.
    This method requires the group to be in a raid context and the player must have
    sufficient permissions to place markers.
  parameters:
  - name: markerId
    description: The identifier of the raid marker (0-7) representing different marker
      types such as skull, cross, star, etc. Valid values are typically 0-7 for standard
      World of Warcraft raid markers.
  - name: mapId
    description: The map identifier where the marker should be placed. This corresponds
      to the Map.dbc entry ID and determines which map the marker appears on.
  - name: positionX
    description: The X coordinate of the marker's position in the world. Must be a
      valid floating-point number representing the location within the specified map.
  - name: positionY
    description: The Y coordinate of the marker's position in the world. Must be a
      valid floating-point number representing the location within the specified map.
  - name: positionZ
    description: The Z coordinate of the marker's position in the world. Must be a
      valid floating-point number representing the vertical position within the specified
      map.
  - name: transportGuid
    description: The GUID of the transport object (if applicable) that the marker
      is associated with. Set to 0 if not using a transport, otherwise should be a
      valid GameObject GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic raid marker placement
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->AddRaidMarker(3,\
      \ 1234, 100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Placing marker on transport
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    GameObject* transport\
      \ = player->GetMap()->GetGameObject(transportGuid);\n    if (transport)\n  \
      \  {\n        group->AddRaidMarker(5, 1234, transport->GetPositionX(), transport->GetPositionY(),\
      \ transport->GetPositionZ(), transport->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method only works for groups in a raid context (not party). The marker
    will be visible to all group members in the same instance. The marker ID corresponds
    to standard World of Warcraft raid marker types: 0=Skull, 1=Cross, 2=Circle, 3=Star,
    4=Triangle, 5=Diamond, 6=Square, 7=Moon.'
  warnings: This method does not validate the mapId or coordinates. Invalid coordinates
    may cause undefined behavior or client-side issues. The marker will persist until
    explicitly removed or the player leaves the instance.
