  method: GetMasteryBonus
  signature: float ChiResource::GetMasteryBonus() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the mastery bonus multiplier applied to chi-based
    abilities.
  description: The GetMasteryBonus method computes the effective mastery bonus that
    influences chi-related gameplay mechanics, such as healing or damage scaling for
    classes that utilize chi resources. This value is typically derived from the player's
    mastery stat and any relevant class-specific modifiers. The returned float represents
    a multiplicative factor (e.g., 1.05 for 5% bonus) that should be applied to chi-based
    calculations. The method does not modify internal state and is safe for repeated
    calls during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the mastery bonus multiplier. A value
    of 1.0 indicates no bonus, while values greater than 1.0 indicate a positive mastery
    bonus, and values less than 1.0 indicate a negative bonus (though this is rare
    in standard gameplay).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Ability Calculation
    code: 'float masteryBonus = player->GetMasteryBonus();

      float chiHealing = baseHealing * masteryBonus;

      player->Heal(chiHealing);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Mastery Bonus for Damage Scaling
    code: 'Unit* target = GetVictim();

      float masteryBonus = GetMasteryBonus();

      float damage = CalculateChiDamage() * masteryBonus;

      target->DealDamage(this, damage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached mastery values from the player's stats
    and applies class-specific calculations. It is recommended to cache this value
    if used multiple times per game tick to avoid redundant computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the ChiResource object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing uninitialized or invalid mastery data may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect calculations.
