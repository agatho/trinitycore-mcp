  method: getHeightFromUint16
  signature: float GridMap::getHeightFromUint16(float x, float y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the height value at the specified coordinates from the grid map's
    height data.
  description: The getHeightFromUint16 method is used to obtain the height value at
    a given x, y coordinate on the grid map. This method is typically employed in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine for terrain height calculations, particularly
    when determining the elevation of objects or characters within the game world.
    It accesses precomputed height data stored as uint16 values and converts them
    into floating-point height values suitable for use in game physics and rendering
    systems. The method assumes that the input coordinates are already normalized
    to the grid map's local coordinate system.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate on the grid map, typically representing horizontal
      position in the game world
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate on the grid map, typically representing vertical
      position in the game world
  returns: A float value representing the height at the specified coordinates. Returns
    a valid height value if the coordinates are within the grid map boundaries, or
    may return an undefined value if the coordinates are outside the valid range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get terrain height
    code: "float height = gridMap.getHeightFromUint16(100.5f, 200.3f);\nif (height\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the height value for positioning or collision detection\n\
      \    printf(\"Terrain height at (100.5, 200.3): %f\\n\", height);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using height value for character positioning
    code: 'float playerX = 1234.5f;

      float playerY = 6789.2f;

      float groundHeight = gridMap.getHeightFromUint16(playerX, playerY);

      // Adjust character Z position to match terrain

      playerZ = groundHeight + 1.0f; // Add some offset for character height'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on precomputed height data stored in uint16 format,
    which is typically more memory-efficient than storing full float values. The conversion
    from uint16 to float may involve scaling factors or offsets depending on how the
    grid map data was originally encoded. This method does not perform bounds checking
    and assumes that the provided coordinates are valid for the current grid map instance.
  warnings: This method should not be called with invalid coordinates as it may return
    unpredictable values or cause undefined behavior. Always ensure coordinate validation
    before calling this method, especially when dealing with dynamic positions or
    user input. The returned height value represents a specific point in the terrain
    and may not account for objects or entities that might be positioned at that location.
