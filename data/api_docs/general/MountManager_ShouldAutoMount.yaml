  signature: bool MountManager::ShouldAutoMount(int * player, const int & destination)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player should automatically mount based on current game
    state and destination.
  description: The ShouldAutoMount method evaluates various conditions to decide if
    a player should be automatically mounted when traveling to a specified destination.
    This includes checking the player's current location, movement state, available
    mounts, and game rules such as zone restrictions or combat status. The method
    considers whether auto-mounting would improve gameplay efficiency or violate any
    game mechanics. It is typically used by the game engine to determine automatic
    mount behavior during movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that may need to be mounted. This parameter
      represents the entity whose auto-mount status is being evaluated.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to the destination coordinate or location identifier where
      the player intends to move. Used to determine if mounting would be beneficial
      for travel efficiency.
  returns: Returns true if the player should automatically mount when moving to the
    specified destination, false otherwise. The decision is based on factors such
    as distance, terrain type, combat status, and available mounts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement logic
    code: "if (mountManager.ShouldAutoMount(&player, destination)) {\n    player.Mount();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with pathfinding system
    code: "void Player::MoveToDestination(Position dest) {\n    if (mountManager.ShouldAutoMount(this,\
      \ dest)) {\n        this->Mount();\n    }\n    // Continue with movement logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core movement and mount handling system in TrinityCore.
    It may be called frequently during player movement operations, so performance
    is important. The implementation likely caches certain state information to avoid
    repeated expensive checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Incorrect usage could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also
    note that auto-mounting may conflict with custom movement scripts or quest-specific
    behaviors.
