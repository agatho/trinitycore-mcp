  class: Player
  method: SetVisibleItemSlot
  signature: void Player::SetVisibleItemSlot(uint8 slot, Item * pItem)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the visible item slot for a player, making the specified item appear
    in the given slot.
  description: This method allows a player to set or update the visible item slot
    in their character's inventory. It is used primarily for displaying items in specific
    slots such as weapons, armor, or other equipment. The method updates the client-side
    representation of the item in the specified slot and ensures that the item appears
    correctly in the player's inventory display. This functionality is essential for
    maintaining proper visual representation of equipped items during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot index where the item should be displayed, ranging from 0
      to 19. Valid values include all equipment slots (weapon, shield, offhand, etc.)
      and other visible slots.
  - name: pItem
    description: Pointer to the Item object that will be displayed in the specified
      slot. Can be nullptr to clear the slot or a valid item pointer to display an
      item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->SetVisibleItemSlot(0, item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Slot Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetVisibleItemSlot(1, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods to ensure proper item display. It should be called after item creation
    or modification to maintain visual consistency.
  warnings: Incorrect slot values may cause client-side display issues or lead to
    invalid item display. Care must be taken when setting slot values to avoid conflicts
    with existing items in that slot.
