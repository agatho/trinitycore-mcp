  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GetTauntSpellForBot
  signature: uint32 ThreatCoordinator::GetTauntSpellForBot(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID of the taunt ability used by a specific bot.
  description: The GetTauntSpellForBot method retrieves the unique identifier (spell
    ID) of the taunt spell that is assigned to a particular bot within the threat
    coordination system. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot behavior to
    determine which taunt spell should be cast when engaging enemies or managing threat
    distribution. The method takes a bot's GUID as input and returns the corresponding
    taunt spell ID, allowing the bot to execute appropriate threat management actions
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve the
      taunt spell. This value should correspond to a valid bot entity within the game
      world.
  returns: Returns the spell ID of the taunt ability assigned to the specified bot.
    If no taunt spell is found or the bot GUID is invalid, the method may return 0
    or an undefined value.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Taunt Spell for a Bot
    code: "uint32 tauntSpellId = threatCoordinator.GetTauntSpellForBot(12345);\nif\
      \ (tauntSpellId != 0)\n{\n    // Use the taunt spell ID to cast the spell\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, tauntSpellId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ThreatCoordinator class and likely relies on internal
    mappings between bot GUIDs and their assigned taunt spells. It may be used in
    conjunction with other threat management functions to ensure proper AI behavior
    during combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to a valid bot entity, as
    invalid or non-existent GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect spell
    IDs being returned.
