  signature: void EvokerAI::UpdateEmpowermentSystem()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's empowerment system state and cooldowns.
  description: The UpdateEmpowermentSystem method manages the internal state of an
    evoker's empowerment mechanics, including tracking active empowerment effects,
    updating cooldown timers, and determining when new empowerment abilities can be
    cast. This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles to ensure that
    the evoker's empowerment system remains synchronized with the game state. It handles
    logic for transitioning between different empowerment states, such as from empowered
    to non-empowered, and ensures proper resource management for empowered abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateEmpowermentSystem();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be called regularly during the AI update cycle.
    It relies on internal state tracking and should not be invoked outside of the
    normal AI execution flow. The method does not directly interact with the player
    or creature objects, but rather manages the AI's understanding of empowerment
    states.
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless you are implementing a custom
    AI behavior that requires direct control over empowerment state management. Improper
    invocation may lead to inconsistent empowerment states and unexpected ability
    behavior.
