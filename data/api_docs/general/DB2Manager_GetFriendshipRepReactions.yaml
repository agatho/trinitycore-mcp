documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the friendship reputation reactions for a given friendship reputation
    ID.
  description: The GetFriendshipRepReactions method fetches an array of integer values
    representing the reputation reactions associated with a specific friendship reputation
    ID. This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to
    determine how player factions interact with different NPC factions based on their
    friendship status. The returned pointer points to a static array of integers,
    which should not be modified or freed by the caller. The method assumes that the
    friendship reputation data has been properly loaded into the DB2Manager's internal
    data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the friendship reputation
    reactions. The array size and content depend on the specific friendship reputation
    ID provided. Returns nullptr if no data is found for the given ID or if the internal
    data structure is not properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve friendship reputation reactions
    code: "const int* reactions = sDB2Manager->GetFriendshipRepReactions(12345);\n\
      if (reactions != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) // Assuming max\
      \ 4 reactions\n    {\n        printf(\"Reaction %d: %d\\n\", i, reactions[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal DB2 data structures and should only be called
    after the DB2 files have been properly loaded. The returned array is managed internally
    and must not be freed by the caller. Ensure that the friendshipRepID parameter
    corresponds to a valid entry in the FriendshipReputation.db2 file.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array as it points to internal static memory.
    Calling this method with an invalid friendshipRepID may result in undefined behavior
    or return nullptr. Always check for null before using the returned pointer.
