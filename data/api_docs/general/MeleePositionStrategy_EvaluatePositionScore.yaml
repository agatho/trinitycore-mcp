  class: MeleePositionStrategy
  method: EvaluatePositionScore
  signature: float MeleePositionStrategy::EvaluatePositionScore(const int & pos, Player
    * bot, Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a positional score for optimal melee combat positioning
    relative to the target.
  description: The EvaluatePositionScore method calculates a numerical score representing
    how favorable a given position is for melee combat. This score considers factors
    such as distance to the target, line of sight, and potential threat distribution.
    The method is typically used by AI bots to determine the best location for engaging
    an enemy in melee range. It takes into account the bot's current position, the
    target unit's position, and various combat-related metrics to return a float value
    indicating positional preference. A higher score indicates a more advantageous
    position for melee engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index or identifier being evaluated for melee positioning.
      This typically represents a specific coordinate or predefined position within
      the bot's tactical map.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      whose positioning is being evaluated. This parameter provides context for the
      bot's capabilities and current state during evaluation.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy target against
      which the position is being scored. This determines the positional relationship
      and threat assessment.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated positional score for melee engagement.
    Higher values indicate more favorable positions, while lower or negative scores
    suggest poor positioning. The exact scale and interpretation may vary based on
    internal AI logic but generally follows a normalized scoring system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float score = strategy.EvaluatePositionScore(5, bot, target);\nif (score\
      \ > 0.7f) {\n    // Move to this position\n    bot->MoveTo(target->GetPositionX(),\
      \ target->GetPositionY(), target->GetPositionZ());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterative Position Scoring for Best Option
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nint bestPosition = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_POSITIONS;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float currentScore = strategy.EvaluatePositionScore(i, bot, target);\n\
      \    if (currentScore > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = currentScore;\n  \
      \      bestPosition = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for movement\nbot->MoveTo(bestPosition);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and assumes that both bot
    and target are valid objects in the game world. The scoring algorithm likely incorporates
    distance calculations, threat assessment, and environmental factors such as terrain
    or obstacles. Performance is generally optimized for frequent calls during combat
    decision-making loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent null pointer exceptions. The returned score values should be
    interpreted within context of the overall AI strategy, as raw scores may not directly
    translate to actionable movement decisions without proper normalization or thresholding.
