  signature: bool BotAI::CanExecuteAction(Action * action) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot AI can execute a given action based on current conditions
    and state.
  description: The CanExecuteAction method evaluates if a specified action is currently
    executable by the bot AI. It checks various preconditions such as resource availability,
    cooldowns, target validity, and other contextual factors that may prevent an action
    from being performed. This method is crucial for the decision-making process of
    bot AIs, ensuring they only attempt actions that are feasible given their current
    state and environment. The result directly influences which actions the AI will
    queue or execute next in its behavior cycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the action can be executed under current conditions; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether all prerequisites for executing the action
    have been met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botAI->CanExecuteAction(action)) {\n    botAI->ExecuteAction(action);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where action cannot be executed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Action Queue
    code: "for (auto& action : actionQueue) {\n    if (botAI->CanExecuteAction(action))\
      \ {\n        botAI->ExecuteAction(action);\n        break; // Execute only the\
      \ first valid action\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as whether the bot has sufficient
    mana, health, or other resources required for the action. It may also verify that
    targets are within range or that the action is not on cooldown. The implementation
    might be optimized to quickly return false if obvious preconditions fail, avoiding
    expensive computations.
  warnings: Do not assume all actions returned as executable will succeed in execution
    due to dynamic conditions changing between the check and actual execution. Also,
    this method may be called frequently during AI processing, so performance is important.
