  method: DiseaseInfo
  signature: void DiseaseInfo::DiseaseInfo(DiseaseType t, int spell, int duration)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DiseaseInfo object with specified disease type, spell ID, and
    duration.
  description: The DiseaseInfo constructor initializes a disease information structure
    with the provided disease type, associated spell identifier, and duration. This
    method is typically used within the TrinityCore WoW server framework to manage
    disease effects on units. The disease type determines the category of the ailment
    (e.g., poison, disease, curse), while the spell ID links it to a specific game
    spell definition. The duration parameter specifies how long the disease effect
    will persist in milliseconds. This constructor is part of the core disease management
    system that handles afflictions applied to players and creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The DiseaseType enum value indicating the category of the disease
      (e.g., poison, disease, curse). Valid values are defined in the DiseaseType
      enumeration.
  - name: spell
    description: The spell identifier (Spell ID) that corresponds to the specific
      disease effect. This must be a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration of the disease effect in milliseconds. Must be a positive
      integer value representing the time the affliction will last.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DiseaseInfo Initialization
    code: DiseaseInfo disease(DiseaseType::DISEASE_TYPE_POISON, 34567, 10000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Disease with Specific Duration
    code: 'DiseaseInfo plague(DiseaseType::DISEASE_TYPE_DISEASE, 25689, 30000);

      // Creates a disease effect lasting 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when applying
    disease effects to units. The DiseaseType enum values are defined in the TrinityCore
    source code and should match the expected categories for disease management. The
    spell ID parameter must reference an existing spell entry in the database, otherwise
    the disease effect may not function correctly.
  warnings: Incorrect DiseaseType values may cause undefined behavior or invalid disease
    effects. The spell ID must correspond to a valid spell that actually applies disease
    mechanics. Using negative duration values will result in unexpected behavior and
    should be avoided.
