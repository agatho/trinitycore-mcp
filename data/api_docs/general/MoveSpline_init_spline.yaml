  class: MoveSpline
  method: init_spline
  signature: void MoveSpline::init_spline(const MoveSplineInitArgs & args)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a movement spline with the provided arguments for smooth character
    movement.
  description: The init_spline method sets up the internal state of a MoveSpline object
    based on the provided MoveSplineInitArgs. This method is responsible for configuring
    the spline's path, speed, orientation, and other movement parameters that define
    how an object (typically a player or creature) will move through the game world.
    It prepares the spline for execution by calculating necessary interpolation points
    and establishing movement constraints. The method typically called during movement
    initialization before starting actual spline-based motion.
  parameters:
  - name: args
    description: A const reference to MoveSplineInitArgs structure containing initialization
      parameters including waypoints, speed, orientation, and movement flags that
      define the spline's behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic spline initialization with waypoints
    code: 'MoveSplineInitArgs args;

      args.SetFirstDirection(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);

      args.SetVelocity(5.0f);

      args.SetPath({{0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, {10.0f, 10.0f, 0.0f}, {20.0f, 20.0f, 0.0f}});

      moveSpline.init_spline(args);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per spline instance before any movement
    execution occurs. The MoveSplineInitArgs structure must contain valid data; otherwise,
    the spline may not initialize correctly or could cause undefined behavior during
    movement.
  warnings: Calling init_spline multiple times on the same MoveSpline instance without
    proper cleanup can lead to memory leaks or corrupted internal state. Ensure that
    all waypoints and parameters in args are valid before calling this method.
