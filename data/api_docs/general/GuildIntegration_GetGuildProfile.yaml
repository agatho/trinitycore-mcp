  class: GuildIntegration
  method: GetGuildProfile
  signature: GuildProfile GuildIntegration::GetGuildProfile(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the guild profile data for a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetGuildProfile method fetches the complete guild profile information
    associated with a given player's unique identifier (GUID). This includes details
    such as the player's guild name, rank, achievements, and other relevant guild-related
    data. The method is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation to provide players with their current guild status and related
    information. It performs a lookup in the database or cached memory structures
    to retrieve the profile data. The method assumes that the player is part of a
    guild, otherwise it may return an empty or default profile structure.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild profile is
      being requested. This value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing
      a player in the game world.
  returns: A GuildProfile object containing all relevant information about the player's
    guild membership, including guild name, rank, achievements, and other related
    data. If no guild profile is found for the given player GUID, an empty or default-initialized
    GuildProfile may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nGuildProfile profile = guildIntegration.GetGuildProfile(playerId);\n\
      if (!profile.IsEmpty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Player's Guild: \" << profile.guildName\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Player Guild Status
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nGuildProfile profile = guildIntegration.GetGuildProfile(playerId);\n\
      if (profile.guildName.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Player is not in a guild.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Guild Rank: \" << profile.rank\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups or cached data retrieval, so performance
    can vary depending on the server's caching strategy. It is recommended to cache
    results when frequently accessed for the same player GUIDs. The GuildProfile object
    returned should be treated as read-only unless explicitly designed otherwise.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual
    player in the game world, otherwise undefined behavior or errors may occur. This
    method might not handle cases where a player has multiple guild memberships correctly
    if such scenarios are not supported by the underlying implementation.
