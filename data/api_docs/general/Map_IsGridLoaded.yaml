  class: Map
  method: IsGridLoaded
  signature: bool Map::IsGridLoaded(const Position & pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a grid at the specified position has been loaded in the map.
  description: The IsGridLoaded method determines if a specific grid cell has been
    loaded within the Map object. This is crucial for managing world object loading
    and ensuring that players or NPCs are properly positioned within loaded grids.
    The method takes a Position parameter which specifies coordinates in the world,
    and returns true if the grid at that position has been loaded, false otherwise.
    This functionality is essential for maintaining proper game mechanics and preventing
    errors when accessing objects in unloaded areas.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: A Position object containing X, Y, and Z coordinates that specify
      the location in world space to check for grid loading status.
  returns: Returns true if the grid at the specified position has been loaded, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the grid cell is available for use or not.
  examples:
  - title: Check Grid Loading Status
    code: "Position pos;\npos.x = 100.0f;\npos.y = 200.0f;\npos.z = 50.0f;\nbool loaded\
      \ = map->IsGridLoaded(pos);\nif (loaded)\n{\n    // Grid is loaded, proceed\
      \ with object operations\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Grid is not loaded, handle accordingly\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's grid management
    system to determine if a grid has been loaded for the purpose of object spawning
    and positioning. It may be called frequently during gameplay, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account when using it in loops or high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to incorrect
    assumptions about object availability if used improperly. The method does not
    guarantee that objects are actually present in the grid - it only indicates whether
    the grid has been loaded.
