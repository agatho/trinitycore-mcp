  method: InitStatsForLevel
  signature: bool Guardian::InitStatsForLevel(uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the guardian's statistics and attributes based on the specified
    level.
  description: The InitStatsForLevel method configures a Guardian object's base statistics,
    including health, mana, damage, and other combat-related attributes according
    to the provided level. This method is typically invoked during the creation or
    level-up process of a guardian NPC to ensure that its stats scale appropriately
    with its level. It performs calculations based on predefined stat growth tables
    and may also set initial values for spell power, armor, and resistances. The method
    ensures that all necessary attributes are properly initialized before the guardian
    enters combat or becomes active in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all stats were properly
    set; returns false if the level parameter is invalid or if initialization fails
    due to internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Guardian Stats at Level 10
    code: "Guardian* guardian = new Guardian();\nbool success = guardian->InitStatsForLevel(10);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Guardian stats are now initialized for level 10\n  \
      \  // Can proceed with further setup or combat readiness\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Guardian Stats and Validate Success
    code: "uint8 targetLevel = 25;\nGuardian* guardian = ObjectAccessor::GetCreature(*player,\
      \ guardianGuid);\nif (guardian && guardian->InitStatsForLevel(targetLevel))\n\
      {\n    // Stats successfully initialized\n    // Perform additional setup like\
      \ adding spells or setting AI behavior\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize guardian stats for level\
      \ %u\", targetLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the creation of a Guardian NPC or
    when leveling up an existing guardian. It relies on internal stat scaling tables
    defined in the TrinityCore configuration and may be affected by server settings
    such as difficulty modifiers or expansion-specific stat adjustments. The method
    does not directly affect the guardian's current health or mana values, but rather
    sets their base maximums.
  warnings: Calling this method on a guardian that is already in combat or has active
    AI behavior may lead to unexpected results. It should only be called during initialization
    or controlled level-up scenarios. Ensure that the level parameter is within valid
    bounds (typically 1-80 for standard content) to avoid undefined behavior.
