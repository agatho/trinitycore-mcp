  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NpcLocationResult class with default values.
  description: The NpcLocationResult constructor initializes a new instance of the
    NpcLocationResult class. This class is typically used to store and manage location
    data for non-player characters (NPCs) within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor
    sets up internal data structures and default state values that are required for
    proper operation of NPC location tracking systems. It ensures that all member
    variables are properly initialized before the object is used in gameplay mechanics
    such as NPC movement, spawn point management, or location-based quest triggers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of NpcLocationResult
    code: 'NpcLocationResult npcLoc;

      // Creates a new NpcLocationResult object with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating new instances
    of NpcLocationResult objects. Developers should be aware that the object's internal
    state may need to be further configured after construction depending on the specific
    use case. The constructor does not perform any heavy operations or external resource
    allocation.
