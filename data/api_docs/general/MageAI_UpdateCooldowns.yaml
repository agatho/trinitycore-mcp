documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for Mage abilities based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown timers of a Mage's spells within the AI system. It processes
    the time difference (diff) passed to it, typically from the game loop's update
    cycle, to decrement active cooldowns and determine when abilities become available
    again. This method ensures that spell usage respects the cooldown mechanics defined
    by the game rules and prevents players from spamming abilities. The method is
    usually called during the AI's periodic update routine to maintain accurate state
    tracking for spell availability.

    code: "void MageAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    //\
      \ Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI's main update loop and should
    be called with a time delta (diff) that reflects the actual elapsed game time
    since the last call. It assumes that the MageAI instance has been properly initialized
    with spell cooldown data and that the internal state tracking is maintained correctly.
