  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetInterruptManager
  signature: InterruptManager * CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetInterruptManager()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interrupt manager instance used for handling spell interruption
    logic within combat behavior.
  description: The GetInterruptManager method returns a pointer to the InterruptManager
    object associated with the CombatBehaviorIntegration class. This manager is responsible
    for tracking and managing spell interruptions during combat, including handling
    interrupts caused by damage, movement, or other combat events. The returned pointer
    is typically used to query or modify interrupt-related behavior for spells and
    abilities within the context of the current combat state. The method does not
    perform any validation on the returned pointer, so callers should ensure that
    the CombatBehaviorIntegration instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the InterruptManager instance used by this CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object. Returns nullptr if the manager has not been initialized or if the parent
    object is in an invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "InterruptManager* interruptMgr = combatBehavior->GetInterruptManager();\n\
      if (interruptMgr)\n{\n    // Use interrupt manager to check or modify spell\
      \ interruption behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Interrupt Status
    code: "CombatBehaviorIntegration* combatBehavior = player->GetCombatBehavior();\n\
      InterruptManager* interruptMgr = combatBehavior->GetInterruptManager();\nif\
      \ (interruptMgr && interruptMgr->IsInterrupted(spellId))\n{\n    // Handle interrupted\
      \ spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The InterruptManager instance returned by this method is owned by the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object and should not be deleted by callers. This method is typically called during
    combat state updates or spell casting operations where interrupt handling is required.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or destroyed CombatBehaviorIntegration
    object may return a null pointer, leading to potential crashes if not properly
    checked. Always validate the returned pointer before use.
