  method: IsDPSSpec
  signature: bool LFGRoleDetector::IsDPSSpec(uint32 specId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified specialization is classified as a damage
    dealer (DPS) role in the LFG system.
  description: The IsDPSSpec method evaluates a given specialization ID to determine
    if it corresponds to a damage dealer role within the Looking for Group (LFG) framework
    of TrinityCore. This functionality is essential for classifying player roles during
    group formation and dungeon matching. The method checks against predefined DPS
    specializations for each class, ensuring that only appropriate specs are flagged
    as DPS. It's commonly used in LFG queue systems to filter and match players based
    on their intended role within a group. The method does not require any external
    state or parameters beyond the specId provided.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified specialization ID represents a damage dealer
    role; otherwise, returns false. This boolean value indicates whether the given
    spec is categorized as a DPS role for LFG purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Spec is DPS
    code: "LFGRoleDetector detector;\nbool isDPS = detector.IsDPSSpec(255); // Example:\
      \ Enhancement Shaman spec ID\nif (isDPS)\n{\n    // Handle DPS specialization\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal mappings of specialization IDs to role classifications.
    The implementation assumes that all class specializations are properly registered
    with their corresponding roles in the LFG system. Developers should ensure that
    specId values passed to this method are valid and correspond to actual player
    specializations within the game.
  warnings: Passing invalid or undefined specialization IDs may lead to incorrect
    return values. Ensure that specId values are validated before calling this method,
    particularly when dealing with dynamic or user-provided input.
