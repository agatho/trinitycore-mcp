  signature: void CreatureAI::JustRegisteredDynObject(DynamicObject * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a dynamic object is registered to the creature's AI system.
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when a DynamicObject
    is associated with the CreatureAI instance. It serves as a notification mechanism
    for the AI to react to the presence of dynamic objects such as area auras, traps,
    or spell effects that are linked to the creature. The method allows the AI implementation
    to perform custom logic upon registration, such as tracking object references,
    triggering events, or modifying behavior based on the dynamic object's properties.
    This is typically used in conjunction with dynamic object management systems within
    the game world.

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustRegisteredDynObject(DynamicObject*\
      \ dynObj) override {\n        // Log when a dynamic object is registered\n \
      \       if (dynObj)\n            sLog->outString(\"Dynamic object %u registered\
      \ to creature %u\", dynObj->GetEntry(), GetCreature()->GetEntry());\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureAI callback system and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations. It's called during the dynamic object registration
    process, so ensure any logic here doesn't block or delay the core game loop. The
    provided DynamicObject pointer may be null in some edge cases, though this is
    uncommon.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls within this method
    as it may impact performance. Do not delete or modify the dynamic object directly
    from this callback unless you are certain of its lifecycle management.
