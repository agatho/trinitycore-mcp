documentation:
  brief: Returns the conditional offer reward text identifier for a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier associated with the conditional
    offer reward text for a specific quest. The conditional offer reward text is used
    in World of Warcraft to determine which text should be displayed when a player
    completes a quest and meets certain conditions. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with quest-related logic to ensure proper display of quest rewards
    based on player's current state or progress.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the integer identifier representing the conditional offer reward
    text for the quest, or -1 if no valid identifier exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int rewardTextId = quest->GetConditionalOfferRewardText();\nif (rewardTextId\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Display the conditional offer reward text\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used within the context
    of quest completion logic. It may return -1 if no conditional offer reward text
    exists for the given quest, indicating that no special text should be displayed.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return -1 if no valid
    conditional offer reward text exists, which could lead to incorrect display of
    quest rewards if not handled properly.
