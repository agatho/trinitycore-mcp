  class: InterruptUtils
  method: GetBestInterrupter
  signature: Player * InterruptUtils::GetBestInterrupter(const InterruptTarget & target,
    const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable player to interrupt a targeted spell
    or ability within a specified group.
  description: The GetBestInterrupter method evaluates available players in a given
    group to identify the optimal candidate for interrupting a specific target's spell
    cast. This utility is commonly used in combat scenarios where multiple players
    may have the capability to interrupt an enemy's casting, but only one should be
    selected based on factors such as available mana, cooldowns, or class-specific
    interrupt abilities. The method considers the InterruptTarget structure which
    defines the spell being interrupted and its properties, and selects a Player from
    the specified group who is best suited for the task. It assumes that the group
    members are valid and capable of performing interrupts.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The InterruptTarget structure defining the spell or ability to be
      interrupted, including its properties such as cast time, mana cost, and interruptibility.
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the group or raid member index.
      This parameter determines which group of players is considered for the interrupt
      selection process.
  returns: A pointer to the Player object that is determined to be the best candidate
    for interrupting the specified target's spell. Returns NULL if no suitable player
    is found in the given group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find an interrupter
    code: "InterruptTarget target;\ntarget.spellId = 12345;\ntarget.castTime = 2000;\n\
      Player* interrupter = InterruptUtils::GetBestInterrupter(target, 0);\nif (interrupter)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with interrupting the spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetBestInterrupter in a combat AI context
    code: "void CombatAI::HandleEnemyCast(Unit* enemy)\n{\n    InterruptTarget target;\n\
      \    target.spellId = enemy->GetCurrentSpell()->m_spellInfo->Id;\n    target.castTime\
      \ = enemy->GetCurrentSpell()->GetCastTime();\n    Player* interrupter = InterruptUtils::GetBestInterrupter(target,\
      \ GetGroup());\n    if (interrupter && interrupter->CanInterruptSpell(enemy))\n\
      \    {\n        interrupter->InterruptSpell(SPELL_INTERRUPT_FLAG_INTERRUPT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal logic to evaluate player capabilities such
    as mana availability and interrupt cooldowns. It may not account for all possible
    situational factors like buffs, debuffs, or specific class abilities that could
    affect interrupt success rates. The group parameter should refer to a valid group
    index within the current instance context.
  warnings: Ensure that the InterruptTarget structure is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Incorrectly configured target data may lead to invalid interrupter
    selection. Also, be cautious when using this in high-frequency contexts as it
    might involve performance overhead due to player evaluation logic.
