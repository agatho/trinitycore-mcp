documentation:
  brief: Adds a spell effect index to the aura's apply effect mask.
  description: The AddEffectToApplyEffectMask method is used to register a specific
    spell effect index within an AuraApplication object. This method updates the internal
    apply effect mask, which determines which effects of an aura are currently active
    or being applied to a target. The effect mask is crucial for managing how aura
    effects interact with the target's state and for determining when certain effects
    should be triggered or updated. This method is typically called during aura application
    or reapplication processes to ensure that all relevant effects are properly tracked.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding an effect to apply mask
    code: 'AuraApplication* auraApp = new AuraApplication();

      // Assume we have a spell effect index from a spell

      int effectIndex = 2;

      // Add the effect to the apply effect mask

      auraApp->AddEffectToApplyEffectMask(effectIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura system in TrinityCore and is typically invoked
    internally by the core engine when processing aura applications. Developers should
    not call this method directly unless they are implementing custom aura logic or
    modifying existing aura behavior.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method without proper understanding of the aura application
    lifecycle may lead to incorrect aura state management, which could cause unexpected
    behavior in gameplay mechanics such as buffs, debuffs, or spell effects.
