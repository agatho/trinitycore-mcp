  class: Transport
  method: UpdatePosition
  signature: void Transport::UpdatePosition(float x, float y, float z, float o)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the transport's world position and orientation with the specified
    coordinates.
  description: The UpdatePosition method is used to synchronize the transport's location
    and rotation within the game world. This method is typically invoked when a transport
    (such as a boat or zeppelin) moves to a new position, ensuring that all passengers
    and associated game objects are correctly positioned relative to the transport.
    The method updates internal state variables representing the transport's X, Y,
    Z coordinates and orientation (o). It also likely triggers updates to related
    systems such as passenger positioning, collision detection, and zone changes.
    This method is critical for maintaining accurate spatial relationships in the
    game world when transports are in motion.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The new X coordinate of the transport's position in the world
  - name: y
    description: The new Y coordinate of the transport's position in the world
  - name: z
    description: The new Z coordinate of the transport's position in the world
  - name: o
    description: The new orientation (rotation) of the transport in radians
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Update
    code: transport->UpdatePosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 1.57f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Transport During Movement
    code: "void UpdateTransportPosition() {\n    float newX = transport->GetPositionX()\
      \ + 1.0f;\n    float newY = transport->GetPositionY() + 1.0f;\n    float newZ\
      \ = transport->GetPositionZ();\n    float newO = transport->GetOrientation();\n\
      \    transport->UpdatePosition(newX, newY, newZ, newO);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from movement update loops or when a transport's
    position changes due to path following. It may internally trigger zone updates
    for passengers and synchronize their positions relative to the transport. The
    method does not perform any validation on input values, so invalid coordinates
    could lead to unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect coordinate values can cause transport
    positioning issues that affect passenger experience. Ensure that position updates
    are synchronized with the transport's movement logic to prevent desynchronization
    between the transport and its passengers.
