documentation:
  brief: Sets the stack amount for an aura creation info object
  description: The SetStackAmount method configures the number of times an aura will
    stack when applied to a target. This is used in aura creation processes to define
    how many layers of the same aura can exist simultaneously on a unit. The stack
    amount directly affects the aura's behavior, including its duration, effects,
    and visual representation. This method returns a reference to the AuraCreateInfo
    object, enabling method chaining for fluent interface patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the AuraCreateInfo object, allowing for method chaining
    operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetStackAmount(5);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.SetStackAmount(3)\n        .SetDuration(10000)\n\
      \        .SetCaster(unit);\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used when constructing aura application parameters
    before applying an aura to a unit. The stack amount determines how many times
    the same aura can be applied to a single target, which is important for mechanics
    like stacking debuffs or buffs that increase in potency with each application.
