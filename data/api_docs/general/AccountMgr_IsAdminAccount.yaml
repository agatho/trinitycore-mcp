  class: AccountMgr
  method: IsAdminAccount
  signature: bool AccountMgr::IsAdminAccount(uint32 gmlevel)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified account level is classified as an administrator
    level within the TrinityCore system.
  description: The IsAdminAccount method evaluates whether a given Game Master (GM)
    level corresponds to an administrative account level. In TrinityCore, GM levels
    are used to define user permissions and access rights, with higher levels typically
    representing more privileged roles. This method checks if the provided GM level
    meets or exceeds the threshold considered as admin-level access. The implementation
    likely references predefined constants or configuration values that define what
    constitutes an administrator account. This check is commonly used in permission
    validation systems to restrict access to administrative functions and commands.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified GM level is classified as an administrator
    level, false otherwise. The method returns false for GM levels below the admin
    threshold, and true for levels that meet or exceed it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Admin Status
    code: "if (AccountMgr::IsAdminAccount(3)) {\n    // This account has admin privileges\n\
      \    printf(\"Account is administrator level\\n\");\n} else {\n    // This account\
      \ does not have admin privileges\n    printf(\"Account is not administrator\
      \ level\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Command Permission Validation
    code: "void HandleAdminCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args) {\n   \
      \ uint32 accountId = handler->GetSession()->GetAccountId();\n    uint32 gmLevel\
      \ = sAccountMgr->GetSecurity(accountId);\n    \n    if (AccountMgr::IsAdminAccount(gmLevel))\
      \ {\n        // Execute admin-only command\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"\
      Executing administrative command...\");\n    } else {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"\
      Access denied: Insufficient privileges.\");\n        return;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal configuration or hardcoded values that define
    what GM level constitutes an admin account. The actual threshold may vary depending
    on the TrinityCore build and server configuration. It's important to note that
    this check is typically used in conjunction with other permission systems for
    comprehensive access control.
  warnings: The method assumes that GM levels are properly defined and that the system
    has a consistent definition of what constitutes an administrative level. Developers
    should verify that their server's GM level definitions align with expected behavior,
    especially when customizing admin privileges or modifying default configurations.
