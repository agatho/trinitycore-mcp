  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetFormationStrictness
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetFormationStrictness(float strictness)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the strictness level of the leader-follow formation behavior.
  description: The SetFormationStrictness method configures how strictly a follower
    unit adheres to the designated formation rules when following a leader. This parameter
    controls the balance between maintaining precise positioning and allowing natural
    movement flexibility. A higher strictness value typically results in tighter adherence
    to formation coordinates, while lower values permit more deviation for smoother,
    less rigid movement patterns. The method directly influences the AI behavior of
    units in group scenarios such as player parties or creature packs.
  parameters:
  - name: strictness
    description: A float value representing the strictness level of formation adherence.
      Valid range is typically between 0.0 (loosest) and 1.0 (strictest). Values outside
      this range may be clamped or result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Strict Formation
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = unit->GetAI()->GetLeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetFormationStrictness(1.0f); // Enforce strict formation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Loose Formation
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = unit->GetAI()->GetLeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetFormationStrictness(0.3f); // Allow more natural movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the leader-follow AI behavior and does not influence
    other types of group positioning or movement mechanics. The strictness parameter
    is internally used to calculate movement thresholds and pathfinding adjustments
    for followers.
  warnings: Setting extremely high strictness values (close to 1.0) may cause unnatural
    or jerky movements in followers, especially in tight spaces or when the leader
    changes direction rapidly. Ensure that the strictness level is appropriate for
    the intended gameplay experience.
