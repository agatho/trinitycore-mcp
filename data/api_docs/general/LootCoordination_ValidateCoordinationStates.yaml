  signature: void LootCoordination::ValidateCoordinationStates()
documentation:
  brief: Validates and ensures consistency of loot coordination states across all
    participants in a group.
  description: The ValidateCoordinationStates method performs internal checks to verify
    that all loot coordination states are consistent and properly synchronized among
    group members. This method is typically invoked during loot distribution processes
    to ensure no participant has an outdated or conflicting state, preventing issues
    such as duplicate loot assignments or incorrect loot ownership. It may also handle
    cleanup of stale coordination data and synchronization of loot-related flags across
    the group. The method operates on internal state management structures and does
    not directly interact with external APIs or game objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution Context
    code: "void SomeLootHandler::HandleLootDistribution()\n{\n    // ... loot preparation\
      \ code ...\n    sLootCoordination->ValidateCoordinationStates();\n    // ...\
      \ continue with distribution logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore loot coordination
    system. It should not be called manually in most cases, as it's invoked automatically
    during loot processing. The validation process may involve iterating through all
    group members and checking their individual loot states against a central coordinator.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of its intended context may lead to inconsistent
    loot state or unexpected behavior. It is recommended to only invoke this method
    when the loot coordination system requires explicit state synchronization.
