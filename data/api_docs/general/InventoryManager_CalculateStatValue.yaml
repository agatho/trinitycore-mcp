documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total stat value of an item based on its template.
  description: The CalculateStatValue method computes the cumulative stat value for
    a given item template, taking into account all applicable modifiers such as item
    level, enchantments, gems, and other bonuses. This method is essential for determining
    the effective stats of an item when it is equipped or evaluated in the game context.
    It serves as a core utility within the inventory management system to provide
    accurate stat calculations for player characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the total calculated stat value of the item
    template, which can be used for various game mechanics such as character stat
    calculation, item comparison, or equipment evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemProto = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      float statValue = inventoryManager.CalculateStatValue(itemProto);

      printf("Calculated stat value: %.2f\n", statValue);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely aggregates contributions from multiple sources including
    base item stats, enchantments, gem bonuses, and item level scaling. It may be
    called frequently during inventory updates or character stat recalculations, so
    performance optimization is important.
