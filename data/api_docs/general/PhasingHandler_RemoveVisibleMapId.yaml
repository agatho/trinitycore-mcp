  class: PhasingHandler

  signature: void PhasingHandler::RemoveVisibleMapId(WorldObject * object, uint32
    visibleMapId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a visible map ID from the phasing system for the specified object.
  description: The RemoveVisibleMapId method removes a specific map ID from the set
    of visible maps for a given WorldObject. This is used in TrinityCore's phasing
    system to control which maps are visible to players or other objects based on
    their current phase. The phasing system allows for dynamic visibility changes,
    such as showing different zones during quests or events. When a map ID is removed
    from an object's visible set, that map will no longer be visible to the object
    until it is added back through another phasing mechanism.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject whose visible map IDs are being modified.
      This can be a Player, Creature, GameObject, or any other WorldObject instance.
  - name: visibleMapId
    description: The map ID to remove from the object's visible maps. This should
      correspond to a valid map identifier in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a map from player's visibility
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 mapIdToRemove = 1234;

      PhasingHandler::RemoveVisibleMapId(player, mapIdToRemove);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove multiple maps from object visibility
    code: "WorldObject* obj = ...;\nuint32 maps[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32\
      \ mapId : maps)\n{\n    PhasingHandler::RemoveVisibleMapId(obj, mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the phasing system which is integral to TrinityCore's
    implementation of dynamic world visibility. The phasing handler manages which
    maps are visible to objects based on various conditions such as quest progress,
    player state, or event triggers. This method does not directly send updates to
    clients; it modifies internal state that will be synchronized during the next
    update cycle.
  warnings: Ensure that the object parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Removing a map ID that was never added may have no effect but could
    indicate incorrect phasing logic. Be cautious when removing map IDs in rapid succession
    as this might cause performance issues if not batched properly.
