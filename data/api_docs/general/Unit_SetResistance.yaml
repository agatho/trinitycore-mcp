  class: Unit
  method: SetResistance
  signature: void Unit::SetResistance(int school, int32 val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the resistance value for a specified school of magic.
  description: The SetResistance method allows a Unit to adjust its magical resistance
    values for a specific school. This is commonly used in game mechanics to modify
    a unit's ability to resist spells or effects from certain schools of magic. The
    method updates the resistance value for the given school, which affects how much
    damage a unit takes from spells of that school. This method is typically used
    during creature AI or player initialization to set base resistance values.
  parameters:
  - name: school
    description: The magical school for which to set resistance (0-7). Valid values
      are 0-7 representing physical, holy, fire, nature, frost, shadow, arcane, and
      holy schools respectively.
  - name: val
    description: The resistance value to set for the specified school. Negative values
      indicate increased resistance while positive values indicate decreased resistance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Fire Resistance
    code: Unit->SetResistance(1, 50);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Shadow Resistance
    code: Unit->SetResistance(5, -20);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the Unit's resistance values and should be
    used carefully as it affects how the unit responds to magical attacks. The resistance
    value is stored in the Unit's internal data structures and can be modified multiple
    times during runtime.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect resistance calculations,
    affecting gameplay balance. Ensure that the school parameter matches valid magic
    school types (0-7).
