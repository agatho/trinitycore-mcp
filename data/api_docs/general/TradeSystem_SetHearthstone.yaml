  method: SetHearthstone
  signature: void TradeSystem::SetHearthstone(Player * player, uint32 innkeeperGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's hearthstone location to the specified innkeeper's position.
  description: The SetHearthstone method configures a player's hearthstone to teleport
    them back to a specific innkeeper's location. This functionality is part of the
    game's travel system, allowing players to quickly return to known locations. The
    method typically requires that the player be near an innkeeper and that the innkeeper
    GUID corresponds to a valid innkeeper NPC in the world. It modifies the player's
    saved hearthstone location without requiring any additional interaction from the
    player.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose hearthstone location is being
      set. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: innkeeperGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the innkeeper NPC that will serve
      as the hearthstone's destination. Must correspond to a valid innkeeper in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player instance

      uint32 innkeeperGuid = 12345; // GUID of an innkeeper

      TradeSystem::SetHearthstone(player, innkeeperGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates the player's saved hearthstone location in their
    database record or in-memory data structure. It does not perform any teleportation
    itself but rather sets up the destination for future hearthstone usage.
  warnings: Ensure that the innkeeperGuid parameter refers to a valid NPC that is
    actually an innkeeper, otherwise the hearthstone may not function correctly when
    used by the player. Passing an invalid GUID could result in undefined behavior
    or errors.
