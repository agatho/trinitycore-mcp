  signature: bool InventoryManager::StoreItem(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to store an item in the player's inventory, returning true on success
    or false if the item cannot be stored.
  description: The StoreItem method is responsible for placing a given Item object
    into the player's inventory. It handles the logic of finding an appropriate slot
    for the item, considering stack limits, bag space, and item compatibility. The
    method will attempt to place the item in the most suitable location, potentially
    splitting stacks if necessary. This function is typically called when items are
    acquired through looting, crafting, or other game actions that result in item
    acquisition. The method returns false if the item cannot be stored due to inventory
    full conditions or other constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully stored in the inventory, or false
    if storage failed due to inventory constraints such as full bags, incompatible
    items, or invalid item states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Storage
    code: "Item* newItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\nif (newItem)\n{\n   \
      \ bool stored = inventoryManager->StoreItem(newItem);\n    if (stored)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Item successfully stored\n        SendNotification(\"Item stored\
      \ in inventory\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Failed to store item\n\
      \        SendNotification(\"Failed to store item\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the Item object is valid and properly initialized. The
    method may modify the item's position within the inventory system, potentially
    changing its bag and slot indices. It does not handle item destruction or cleanup
    of the original item pointer.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Item pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the item exists before calling StoreItem.
    The method may fail silently if inventory is full, so checking return values is
    important for proper game flow control.
