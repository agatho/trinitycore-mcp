  class: QuestStrategy
  method: UseQuestItemOnTarget
  signature: void QuestStrategy::UseQuestItemOnTarget(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Instructs the bot AI to use a quest item on a target based on the provided
    objective.
  description: The UseQuestItemOnTarget method is responsible for executing the logic
    that causes a bot AI to interact with a specific target using an item required
    by a quest. This method typically handles the selection of the appropriate quest
    item from the bot's inventory, determining the correct target (which may be an
    NPC or object), and initiating the interaction sequence. It is commonly used in
    quest completion strategies where items must be used on specific targets to progress
    the quest. The method relies on the provided objective parameter to determine
    which quest item and target to use. This function is part of the broader QuestStrategy
    class, which manages AI behaviors related to quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will execute the quest item usage.
      This parameter provides access to the bot's state and capabilities.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to an integer representing the quest objective index. This
      value determines which specific quest item and target should be used for the
      interaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Strategy
    code: "void MyQuestStrategy::OnQuestAccept(BotAI* ai, const int& objective)\n\
      {\n    UseQuestItemOnTarget(ai, objective);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Item Usage
    code: "void AdvancedQuestStrategy::ProcessObjective(BotAI* ai, const int& objective)\n\
      {\n    if (HasRequiredItem(ai, objective))\n    {\n        UseQuestItemOnTarget(ai,\
      \ objective);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has sufficient inventory space and that
    the required quest item is available. It does not perform checks for item usability
    or target validity beyond basic existence. The method may internally call other
    AI functions to determine target location and interaction type.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without verifying item availability or target
    validity can lead to bot behavior errors or crashes. Ensure that the objective
    index corresponds to a valid quest item and target before calling this method.
