  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: IsTargetAvailable
  signature: bool ObjectiveTracker::IsTargetAvailable(uint32 targetId, const int &
    location, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified objective target is available within a given radius
    and location.
  description: The IsTargetAvailable method determines whether a specific objective
    target identified by its unique ID is currently available for interaction or tracking.
    It evaluates the target's presence within a defined radius from a specified location,
    taking into account game mechanics such as player proximity, target visibility,
    and objective state. This method is commonly used in quest tracking systems to
    validate if objectives can be interacted with or if they are still active. The
    method requires a valid target ID, a location coordinate, and a radius to perform
    the availability check.
  parameters:
  - name: targetId
    description: The unique identifier of the objective target to check for availability.
      This is typically a quest objective or NPC identifier used within the TrinityCore
      framework.
  - name: location
    description: A reference to an integer representing the location context (e.g.,
      zone ID, map ID) where the target availability should be evaluated.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance from the specified location within which the
      target must be found to be considered available. A value of 0 or negative may
      indicate no distance restriction.
  returns: Returns true if the target with the given ID is available within the specified
    radius and location; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a quest objective is available
    code: "if (objectiveTracker->IsTargetAvailable(12345, player->GetZoneId(), 50.0f))\
      \ {\n    // Objective is available for interaction\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Quest objective is now available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic radius based on player level
    code: "float radius = player->GetLevel() * 2.0f;\nuint32 targetId = 67890;\nint\
      \ location = player->GetMapId();\n\nif (objectiveTracker->IsTargetAvailable(targetId,\
      \ location, radius)) {\n    // Proceed with objective interaction logic\n  \
      \  player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against internal tracking data structures
    and may involve spatial queries or distance calculations. It is recommended to
    cache results when checking frequently, as repeated calls could impact performance
    in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetId corresponds to a valid tracked objective; invalid
    IDs may lead to undefined behavior. Also note that this method might not account
    for all game states (e.g., stealth, invisibility) and should be used in conjunction
    with other validation methods where necessary.
