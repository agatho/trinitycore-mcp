  method: HandleHoTs
  signature: bool RestorationShamanRefactored::HandleHoTs(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Applies or updates HoTs (Healing Over Time) effects for the specified group
  description: The HandleHoTs method manages the application and updating of Healing
    Over Time effects for a given group of players. This method is typically used
    in restoration shaman AI logic to ensure that players receive appropriate periodic
    healing based on their current status and the shaman's active abilities. The method
    evaluates the group members, checks for existing HoT applications, and applies
    new or refreshed healing effects as needed. It handles the core mechanics of how
    restoration shaman spells like Riptide, Healing Stream Totem, and other periodic
    healing effects are managed within the group context.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group of players to apply or
      update HoTs for. Valid values are typically group IDs used internally by TrinityCore's
      group management system.
  returns: Returns true if the HoT handling was successfully processed for the specified
    group, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no valid targets
    were found, the group was invalid, or an error occurred during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic HoT Handling
    code: "if (shaman->HandleHoTs(1)) {\n    // Successfully applied HoTs to group\
      \ 1\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"shaman\", \"HoTs handled successfully for group 1\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional HoT Application
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && shaman->HandleHoTs(group->GetId()))\
      \ {\n    // Apply HoTs only if player is in a valid group\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      shaman\", \"HoTs applied to group {}\", group->GetId());\n} else {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      shaman\", \"Failed to handle HoTs for group {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the TrinityCore's spell system and group
    management components. It may perform checks for player status, mana availability,
    and spell cooldowns before applying healing effects. The method should be called
    regularly in the shaman's AI update loop to maintain continuous HoT application.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter refers to a valid group with active players,
    as invalid groups or empty groups may cause unexpected behavior. This method may
    have performance implications when processing large groups, so consider batching
    operations if needed.
