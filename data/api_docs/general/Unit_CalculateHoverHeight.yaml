  signature: void Unit::CalculateHoverHeight()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the hover height for a unit based on its current movement state
    and collision detection.
  description: This method determines the appropriate hover height for a unit by evaluating
    its movement state, collision bounds, and current position in the game world.
    It is primarily used to ensure proper positioning during flight or when hovering
    above ground level. The calculation considers factors such as unit's bounding
    box dimensions, terrain height, and movement type to determine optimal hover distance
    from ground level.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->CalculateHoverHeight();

      // This method updates the unit''s hover height internally'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking collision bounds, terrain height
    calculations, and movement state evaluation. Performance considerations involve
    minimal overhead since this is typically called during movement updates or when
    unit enters flight mode.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly in most cases; it's usually
    invoked automatically during movement updates or when entering flight mode. Calling
    it manually may cause inconsistent hover height values if not properly synchronized
    with movement state changes.
