documentation:
  brief: Removes a PvP talent from the player's active talent group.
  description: This method removes a specified PvP talent from the player's current
    active talent group. It is used to manage the player's PvP talent points and ensures
    that the talent is properly removed from the talent tree. The method handles the
    removal of talents based on the provided PvpTalentEntry and active talent group
    index, ensuring that the player's talent configuration remains consistent with
    game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: talent
    description: Pointer to the PvpTalentEntry structure representing the PvP talent
      to be removed. This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid talent
      entry.
  - name: activeTalentGroup

      be removed. Valid values are 0 or 1, representing the two talent groups available

    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();


      PvpTalentEntry* talent = new PvpTalentEntry;

  notes: The method internally handles the removal of talent points from the player's
    talent tree and ensures that the talent is properly removed from the specified
    talent group. It does not directly affect the player's overall talent points but
    rather manages the specific talent being removed.
  warnings: This method should not be used to remove talents that are not part of
    the active talent group, as it may cause inconsistencies in the player's talent
    tree. Also, care must be taken when removing talents from different talent groups
    to avoid unintended consequences.
