  class: Battlefield
  method: GetGameObject
  signature: GameObject * Battlefield::GetGameObject(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a GameObject instance from the battlefield using its unique identifier.
  description: The GetGameObject method fetches a GameObject object from the Battlefield's
    internal collection based on the provided GUID. This method is commonly used during
    battleground or battlefield events to access specific game objects such as doors,
    banners, or capture points. The returned pointer can be null if no GameObject
    with the specified GUID exists in the current battlefield context. It is important
    to validate the returned pointer before using it to avoid dereferencing a null
    pointer, which could lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObject to retrieve. This
      value must correspond to an existing GameObject within the battlefield's scope.
  returns: A pointer to the GameObject if found, or nullptr if no GameObject with
    the specified GUID exists in the battlefield.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GameObject* go = battlefield->GetGameObject(12345);\nif (go != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the GameObject\n    go->SetGoState(GO_STATE_ACTIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Null Before Use
    code: "uint32 gameObjectGuid = 67890;\nGameObject* go = battlefield->GetGameObject(gameObjectGuid);\n\
      if (go && go->GetGOInfo())\n{\n    // Safe to use the GameObject\n    sWorld->SendZoneText(go->GetMapId(),\
      \ \"GameObject found!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to retrieve\
      \ GameObject with GUID %u\", gameObjectGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of a specific battlefield instance,
    meaning it only searches for GameObjects that are part of that particular battlefield's
    data structures. The method does not perform any caching or lazy loading; it directly
    accesses the internal container holding GameObject references.
  warnings: Always check if the returned pointer is null before using it. Dereferencing
    a null pointer will result in a crash. Also, be aware that GameObjects may be
    destroyed during battleground events, so even if a valid pointer is returned initially,
    it might become invalid later in the event lifecycle.
