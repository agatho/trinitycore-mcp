  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: AssignTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::AssignTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a target unit to the group coordinator for coordination purposes.
  description: The AssignTarget method sets the target unit that the GroupCoordinator
    will manage and coordinate actions around. This method is typically used in group-based
    AI systems where a leader or coordinator needs to focus on a specific target for
    tactical decisions, such as targeting enemies during combat or focusing on objectives.
    The assigned target becomes the primary focus of the group's activities, influencing
    behavior patterns and decision-making processes within the group. This method
    does not validate whether the target is valid or alive; it simply assigns the
    provided unit pointer as the current target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be assigned as the target. This
      can be any valid Unit instance, including players, creatures, or game objects.
      The method does not perform null checks on this parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Assignment
    code: "Unit* enemy = player->GetVictim();\nif (enemy)\n{\n    groupCoordinator->AssignTarget(enemy);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Target Assignment with Validation
    code: "if (target && target->IsAlive())\n{\n    groupCoordinator->AssignTarget(target);\n\
      \    // Proceed with group coordination logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly assigns the provided Unit pointer without performing
    any validation or reference counting. The GroupCoordinator is expected to handle
    target lifecycle management appropriately. This method may be called frequently
    during combat scenarios, so performance considerations should be taken into account
    when implementing custom group coordination logic.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the target unit remains valid for the duration of its assignment.
    The method does not automatically update other components of the group coordinator
    that might depend on the previous target.
