documentation:
  brief: Rebuilds the internal lookup map used for managing spawn priorities in the
    SpawnPriorityQueue.
  description: The RebuildLookupMap method reconstructs the internal data structure
    that maps spawn priorities to their corresponding entities within the SpawnPriorityQueue.
    This operation is typically invoked when the queue's contents have been modified
    externally, ensuring that the lookup mechanism remains consistent with the current
    state of spawns. The method iterates through all active spawns and rebuilds an
    optimized index for fast retrieval based on priority levels. It is essential for
    maintaining performance in scenarios involving frequent spawn additions, removals,
    or priority updates.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpawnPriorityQueue queue;

      // ... populate the queue with spawns ...

      queue.RebuildLookupMap(); // Synchronize lookup map after modifications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it performs a full rebuild of the
    internal lookup structure, which can be computationally expensive. It is recommended
    to batch spawn modifications and call RebuildLookupMap once after all changes
    are complete rather than calling it after each individual change.
  warnings: Calling RebuildLookupMap unnecessarily may cause performance degradation
    due to its O(n) complexity where n is the number of spawns in the queue. Avoid
    invoking this method during high-frequency operations such as tick processing
    or real-time event handling without careful consideration.
