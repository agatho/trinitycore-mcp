  class: AreaTrigger
  method: BuildValuesUpdate
  signature: void AreaTrigger::BuildValuesUpdate(int * data, int flags, const int
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates update data for an area trigger with specified flags and target.
  description: The BuildValuesUpdate method constructs and fills update buffer data
    for an AreaTrigger object, preparing it for network transmission to clients. This
    method is typically invoked during the update cycle when area trigger state changes
    need to be synchronized with the world. The method uses provided parameters to
    determine what aspects of the area trigger should be updated, such as position,
    scale, or visual effects. It integrates with TrinityCore's object update system
    to ensure that client-side representations remain consistent with server-side
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the constructed update data will
      be written. This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold
      all relevant update fields.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that specify which parts of the area trigger's data
      should be included in the update. These flags control the update behavior, such
      as whether to send position, scale, or other properties.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target object for this
      area trigger. This may be used to determine how the area trigger interacts with
      specific entities in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesUpdate
    code: 'int updateData[UPDATE_FIELDS_COUNT];

      int flags = UPDATEFLAG_POSITION | UPDATEFLAG_ROTATION;

      int targetData[OBJECT_END];

      areaTrigger->BuildValuesUpdate(updateData, flags, targetData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal update system and should not be called
    directly by external code. It's usually invoked automatically during object updates.
    The size of the 'data' array must be sufficient to accommodate all fields based
    on the provided flags.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the 'flags' parameter can lead to incomplete or invalid
    updates being sent to clients, potentially causing visual glitches or synchronization
    issues. Ensure that the target array is properly initialized before calling this
    method.
