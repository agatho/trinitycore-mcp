  method: GetHistoricalData
  signature: std::vector<PerformanceMetrics> IBotMetricsCollector::GetHistoricalData(std::chrono::minutes
    duration) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves historical performance metrics data for a specified time duration.
  description: The GetHistoricalData method fetches a collection of performance metrics
    recorded over a given time period. This method is typically used by bot monitoring
    systems to analyze system behavior, identify bottlenecks, or track resource usage
    trends. The returned vector contains structured data points representing various
    metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution times. The duration
    parameter controls how far back in time the data should be retrieved, allowing
    for flexible analysis of recent performance patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: Specifies the time window (in minutes) for which historical metrics
      should be collected. A value of zero or negative will typically return no data.
  returns: A std::vector<PerformanceMetrics> containing performance data points recorded
    within the specified duration. Each element represents a snapshot of system metrics
    at a specific point in time, with empty vector returned if no matching data exists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve last hour of performance data
    code: "auto metrics = collector->GetHistoricalData(std::chrono::minutes(60));\n\
      for (const auto& metric : metrics) {\n    std::cout << \"CPU: \" << metric.cpuUsage\
      \ << \"% Memory: \" << metric.memoryUsage << \"MB\\n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Analyze recent performance trends
    code: "auto recentMetrics = collector->GetHistoricalData(std::chrono::minutes(30));\n\
      if (!recentMetrics.empty()) {\n    double avgCpu = 0;\n    for (const auto&\
      \ m : recentMetrics) {\n        avgCpu += m.cpuUsage;\n    }\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Average CPU usage: \" << (avgCpu / recentMetrics.size()) << \"%\\n\"\
      ;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database or cache lookups depending on the implementation.
    It's recommended to avoid calling this method too frequently in performance-critical
    sections of code. The returned data is typically sorted chronologically from oldest
    to newest.
  warnings: Calling this method with very large duration values might result in significant
    memory usage and processing time. Ensure that the system has sufficient resources
    when retrieving extended historical datasets.
