  method: CritterAI
  signature: void CritterAI::CritterAI(int * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a critter AI instance with the specified creature and script
    ID
  description: The CritterAI constructor initializes a new critter AI behavior for
    a creature. This method sets up the necessary internal state to manage the AI
    logic for critters, which are typically small, non-combat creatures like pets
    or companion animals in World of Warcraft. The constructor takes a pointer to
    a creature object and a script ID that determines the specific behavior script
    to be used. Critter AIs generally follow simple movement patterns, avoid combat,
    and may have special interactions based on their script configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that this AI will control. Must not
      be null.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Identifier for the specific critter AI script to be used. Determines
      behavior patterns and actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CritterAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* myCritter = ...; // Get a creature instance

      uint32 scriptId = 12345;

      CritterAI* ai = new CritterAI(myCritter, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CritterAI with Creature Manager
    code: "void InitializeCritter(Creature* critter)\n{\n    uint32 scriptId = critter->GetCreatureTemplate()->ScriptID;\n\
      \    new CritterAI(critter, scriptId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when a creature with a critter AI script is spawned. The AI instance will automatically
    manage the creature's behavior according to the specified script. Developers should
    not manually instantiate CritterAI objects unless implementing custom AI logic.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on existing creature instances without
    proper initialization. The creature must be properly registered with the world
    system before assigning a CritterAI. Passing null pointers for creature parameter
    will cause undefined behavior and likely crashes.
