  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: CalculateTargetPriority
  signature: float GroupCombatTrigger::CalculateTargetPriority(Group * group, Unit
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a priority value for a target unit within a group
    context.
  description: The CalculateTargetPriority method evaluates and assigns a numerical
    priority score to a specified target unit based on various combat-related factors
    within the context of a group. This method is typically used by AI systems or
    combat logic to determine which target should be prioritized for attacks or focus.
    The priority calculation may consider factors such as threat level, distance,
    target health, and other relevant combat metrics. The returned float value represents
    the relative importance of the target in the current group combat scenario, where
    higher values indicate higher priority targets.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that contains the unit performing the
      calculation. This parameter defines the group context for target prioritization.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose priority
      is being calculated. This represents the unit against which the priority score
      will be evaluated.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority of the target within
    the group context. Higher values indicate higher priority targets, while lower
    or negative values may indicate low or no priority.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "float priority = groupCombatTrigger.CalculateTargetPriority(playerGroup,\
      \ enemyTarget);\nif (priority > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Prioritize this target for\
      \ attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using priority to select best target
    code: "Unit* bestTarget = nullptr;\nfloat highestPriority = -1.0f;\nfor (auto&\
      \ member : group->GetMembers())\n{\n    if (member->IsAlive() && member->CanAttack(target))\n\
      \    {\n        float priority = groupCombatTrigger.CalculateTargetPriority(group,\
      \ target);\n        if (priority > highestPriority)\n        {\n           \
      \ highestPriority = priority;\n            bestTarget = target;\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger combat decision-making system and
    may be called frequently during combat scenarios. The exact algorithm used for
    calculating priority is implementation-specific but generally involves evaluating
    threat, distance, and target vulnerability. The method assumes valid pointers
    to both group and target units.
  warnings: Ensure that both group and target parameters are valid and non-null before
    calling this method, as passing invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The method should not be called during critical sections where group
    membership might change unexpectedly.
