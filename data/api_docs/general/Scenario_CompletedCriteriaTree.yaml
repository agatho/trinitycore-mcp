  method: CompletedCriteriaTree
  signature: void Scenario::CompletedCriteriaTree(const int * tree, int * referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a scenario criteria tree as completed for the specified player
  description: The CompletedCriteriaTree method is used to mark a specific scenario
    criteria tree as fully completed for a given player. This method likely updates
    internal tracking structures within the scenario system to reflect that all objectives
    in the specified criteria tree have been met. The method operates on a tree structure
    of criteria, which represents the hierarchical progression of objectives within
    a scenario. It is typically invoked when a player successfully completes all required
    tasks or conditions defined in a particular scenario branch.
  parameters:
  - name: tree
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the criteria tree structure.
      Each element likely corresponds to a specific criterion or objective within
      the scenario's progression system.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (likely
      a GUID) for whom the criteria tree completion is being recorded.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CompletedCriteriaTree
    code: 'int criteriaTree[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

      uint64 playerGuid = 12345;

      Scenario* scenario = ...; // Obtain scenario instance

      scenario->CompletedCriteriaTree(criteriaTree, &playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the scenario's internal state management
    system. It may trigger additional events or updates to the player's scenario progress
    tracking. The tree parameter should represent a valid criteria hierarchy structure
    that exists within the scenario definition.
  warnings: Ensure that the criteria tree array contains valid indices that correspond
    to existing objectives in the scenario. Passing invalid or uninitialized pointers
    could result in undefined behavior or crashes.
