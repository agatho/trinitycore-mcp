  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: IsAutoScalingEnabled
  signature: bool BotPerformanceMonitor::IsAutoScalingEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether automatic scaling of bot behavior is enabled within the
    performance monitor.
  description: The IsAutoScalingEnabled method checks if the BotPerformanceMonitor
    has automatic scaling functionality activated. This feature dynamically adjusts
    bot behavior based on system performance metrics to maintain optimal gameplay
    experience. When enabled, bots may reduce their activity levels or modify their
    decision-making processes when system resources are low. The method returns a
    boolean value indicating the current state of this auto-scaling mechanism. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining server stability and performance in environments
    with varying resource availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if automatic scaling is enabled, false otherwise. When true,
    the monitor will automatically adjust bot behavior based on performance metrics;
    when false, bots operate at fixed behavior levels regardless of system conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Check Auto Scaling Status
    code: "if (botPerformanceMonitor.IsAutoScalingEnabled()) {\n    std::cout << \"\
      Auto scaling is active.\"\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Auto scaling is disabled.\"\
      \n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Behavior Based on Scaling Status
    code: "if (botPerformanceMonitor.IsAutoScalingEnabled()) {\n    // Enable dynamic\
      \ bot adjustments\n    botManager.SetBotBehavior(BotBehavior::Dynamic);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Maintain fixed bot behavior\n    botManager.SetBotBehavior(BotBehavior::Static);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with performance monitoring
    systems to make real-time decisions about bot resource allocation. The auto-scaling
    feature may be toggled by server administrators or automatically enabled/disabled
    based on detected system load.
