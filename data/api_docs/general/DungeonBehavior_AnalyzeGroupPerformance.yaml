  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: AnalyzeGroupPerformance
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::AnalyzeGroupPerformance(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes group performance during a dungeon encounter and updates relevant
    statistics.
  description: The AnalyzeGroupPerformance method evaluates how a player group performed
    during a specific dungeon encounter. It processes various metrics such as damage
    dealt, healing done, survival rates, and completion times to determine overall
    group effectiveness. This method is typically invoked after an encounter ends
    to provide feedback on group coordination and performance. The analysis considers
    individual player contributions as well as collective group behavior, updating
    internal tracking structures for future reference. It plays a key role in dungeon
    difficulty scaling and player progression systems within TrinityCore's raid and
    dungeon framework.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group being analyzed.
      Must be a valid group with at least one member, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter structure containing details about
      the specific dungeon encounter being evaluated. Includes information such as
      boss name, difficulty, and encounter duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon completion handler
    code: "void OnDungeonComplete(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n\
      {\n    DungeonBehavior behavior;\n    behavior.AnalyzeGroupPerformance(group,\
      \ encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with performance logging system
    code: "void DungeonManager::HandleEncounterEnd(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    if (group && !group->GetMembers().empty())\n    {\n   \
      \     DungeonBehavior behavior;\n        behavior.AnalyzeGroupPerformance(group,\
      \ encounter);\n        // Log performance data for further analysis\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group and encounter data are fully initialized
    before calling. It may modify internal state variables of the DungeonBehavior
    class to store performance metrics. The analysis includes time-based calculations,
    so timing accuracy depends on server clock precision.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer or invalid encounter data
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group contains valid players and
    the encounter has proper initialization before invoking this method.
