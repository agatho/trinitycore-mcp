  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current spell being cast by the bot AI.
  description: The SpellInterruptAction::Execute method is responsible for interrupting
    any ongoing spell casting by the bot AI. This action is typically used when the
    bot needs to stop its current spell cast in response to an external event or condition,
    such as being attacked, receiving a new command, or encountering a priority situation.
    The method interacts with the bot's AI context and ensures that the spell interruption
    is handled properly within the TrinityCore framework. It returns an ActionResult
    indicating success or failure of the interruption attempt.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActionResult enum value indicating whether the spell interruption was
    successful, failed, or resulted in a specific outcome. Possible values may include
    SUCCESS, FAILED, or PENDING depending on the implementation and context of the
    interruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption
    code: "ActionResult result = spellInterruptAction.Execute(ai, context);\nif (result\
      \ == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Spell was interrupted successfully\n \
      \   ai->GetUnit()->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot is actively casting a spell.
    Calling it without an active spell cast may result in undefined behavior or no-op
    execution. The action typically modifies the AI's internal state to reflect that
    a spell interruption has occurred.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer and context are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid pointers can lead to crashes. Also, be aware that interrupting
    certain high-priority spells might have unintended consequences on the bot's behavior
    or combat effectiveness.
