  signature: void DungeonScript::MoveAwayFromGroundEffect(int * player, int * obj)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player away from a ground effect object in a dungeon scenario.
  description: The MoveAwayFromGroundEffect method is used within DungeonScript to
    relocate a player character away from a specific ground effect object, typically
    invoked during scripted dungeon events or encounters. This functionality is essential
    for managing player positioning during complex mechanics such as area-of-effect
    spells, trap activations, or environmental hazards that require players to move
    out of dangerous zones. The method operates on references to both the player and
    the ground effect object, ensuring proper interaction between the two entities
    within the game world. It's commonly used in scripted events where precise control
    over player movement is required for quest progression or combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the dungeon script context. This parameter identifies which player
      character should be moved away from the ground effect.
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the ground effect object's unique
      identifier (GUID). This parameter specifies which ground effect object the player
      should be moved away from.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon script
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::OnPlayerEnterDungeon(Player* player)\n{\n    GameObject*\
      \ groundEffect = player->FindNearestGameObject(GO_GROUND_EFFECT_ID, 5.0f);\n\
      \    if (groundEffect)\n    {\n        MoveAwayFromGroundEffect(&player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(),\
      \ &groundEffect->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom movement logic
    code: "void MyDungeonScript::HandleAreaEffect(Player* player, GameObject* groundEffect)\n\
      {\n    uint64 playerGUID = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    uint64 objGUID\
      \ = groundEffect->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    \n    // Check if player is\
      \ within danger zone\n    if (player->IsWithinDist(groundEffect, 3.0f))\n  \
      \  {\n        MoveAwayFromGroundEffect(&playerGUID, &objGUID);\n        \n \
      \       // Apply additional effects after movement\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_MOVE_AWAY_EFFECT, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's dungeon scripting system and should
    only be called from within valid dungeon script contexts. The method assumes that
    both player and object GUIDs are valid and exist in the current dungeon instance.
    Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency
    events, as movement operations can impact server performance.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null GUID pointers may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that both player and object exist before
    invoking this function. Be cautious when using this method in rapid succession
    as it may interfere with other movement-related scripts or combat mechanics.
