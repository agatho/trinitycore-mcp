documentation:
  brief: Binds the dynamic object to its caster, establishing a relationship between
    them.
  description: The BindToCaster method establishes a connection between a DynamicObject
    and its caster unit. This binding ensures that the dynamic object follows or remains
    associated with the caster during its lifetime. The method typically sets internal
    references and may update the object's position or properties to maintain proper
    association with the caster. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this
    is commonly used for spell effects like area-of-effect spells or summoned objects
    that should remain linked to their caster. This binding affects how the object
    interacts with the game world, including its destruction behavior and interaction
    with the caster.

  - title: Basic usage in spell effect
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = new DynamicObject();

      dynObj->BindToCaster();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the creation or initialization phase
    of a DynamicObject. It may affect the object's lifetime and destruction behavior,
    particularly when the caster is removed from the world.
