  class: TradeData
  method: SetMoney
  signature: void TradeData::SetMoney(int money)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the trade money amount for the current trade session.
  description: The SetMoney method updates the amount of copper coins that are being
    offered in a trade between two players. This method is typically used during the
    trading process to reflect changes in the money being proposed by one of the trading
    parties. The value passed to this method should be a valid amount of copper (0-999999),
    as exceeding this range may cause unexpected behavior or truncation. This method
    does not validate the amount against the player's available funds, so it is up
    to the calling code to ensure that the specified amount is within acceptable bounds.
  parameters:
  - name: money
    description: The amount of copper coins to set for the trade. Valid range is typically
      0-999999 (representing up to 99g 99s 99c). Values outside this range may be
      truncated or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Trade Money Amount
    code: 'TradeData* trade = player1->GetTradeData();

      trade->SetMoney(50000); // Sets the trade money to 5g 0s 0c'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Trade Money
    code: 'TradeData* trade = player1->GetTradeData();

      trade->SetMoney(0); // Clears any money from the trade'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the TradeData object.
    It should only be called during an active trade session, and changes made using
    this method will immediately affect the trade window display for both players
    involved in the trade.
  warnings: Calling SetMoney with negative values or extremely large numbers may result
    in undefined behavior or data corruption. Always validate input before calling
    this method to prevent potential issues with the trade system.
