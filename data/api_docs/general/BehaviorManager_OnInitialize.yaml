documentation:
  brief: Initializes the behavior manager and prepares it for use in the AI system
  description: The OnInitialize method is responsible for setting up the BehaviorManager
    instance during the initialization phase of the AI system. This method performs
    necessary setup operations such as registering behaviors, initializing internal
    data structures, and preparing the manager to handle AI-related tasks. It should
    be called once during the startup sequence before any behavior execution occurs.
    The method returns true if initialization was successful, or false if an error
    occurred that prevented proper setup.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the behavior manager was successfully initialized, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates a critical failure in the
    initialization process that would prevent the AI system from functioning correctly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = new BehaviorManager();\nif (behaviorMgr->OnInitialize())\
      \ {\n    // Initialization successful, proceed with AI operations\n    printf(\"\
      Behavior manager initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize behavior manager\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the server startup process or when
    a new AI component needs to be initialized. It should not be called multiple times
    on the same instance without proper cleanup. The method may perform operations
    that require access to game data or configuration files, so it's important that
    these resources are available when called.
  warnings: Calling OnInitialize more than once on the same BehaviorManager instance
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure all required dependencies
    are available before calling this method. This method should not be invoked from
    within AI execution contexts as it may cause deadlocks or race conditions.
