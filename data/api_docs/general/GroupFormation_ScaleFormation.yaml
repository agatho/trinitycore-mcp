  class: GroupFormation
  method: ScaleFormation
  signature: void GroupFormation::ScaleFormation(float scaleFactor)
documentation:
  brief: Scales the group formation by the specified factor, adjusting positioning
    and spacing of group members.
  description: The ScaleFormation method modifies the spatial arrangement of group
    members within a formation by applying a scaling factor. This method adjusts the
    distance between players in the group, effectively making the formation larger
    or smaller while maintaining its overall shape and structure. The scaling operation
    is typically used to accommodate different group sizes, adjust for varying player
    speeds, or modify formations based on environmental constraints such as terrain
    or combat situations. The method operates on the current formation state and applies
    the scale factor uniformly across all members of the group.
  parameters:
  - name: scaleFactor
    description: A floating-point value that determines the scaling factor for the
      group formation. Values greater than 1 increase the spacing between group members,
      while values less than 1 decrease the spacing. A value of 1 maintains the original
      formation size. Negative values may result in undefined behavior or reversed
      formation orientation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Scaling
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->ScaleFormation(1.5f); // Increase formation size by 50%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reducing Formation Size
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->ScaleFormation(0.75f); // Reduce formation size to 75% of original'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal formation data structure and may affect
    AI pathfinding calculations for group members. The scaling operation is applied
    immediately and does not account for dynamic changes in player positions during
    execution. For optimal performance, avoid frequent calls to this method within
    tight loops or high-frequency update contexts.
  warnings: Using extremely large scale factors (e.g., >10.0f) may cause group members
    to exceed movement boundaries or become disconnected from the formation. Negative
    scale factors are not recommended and may produce unpredictable results. Always
    ensure that scaled formations remain within valid game world constraints.
