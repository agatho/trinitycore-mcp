  brief: Initializes a new MoveSpline object for handling spline-based movement calculations
    in the game world.
  description: The MoveSpline constructor initializes a new instance of the MoveSpline
    class, which is responsible for managing and calculating smooth spline-based movement
    paths for units in the TrinityCore engine. This class is integral to handling
    character and creature movement animations, particularly for complex pathfinding
    scenarios involving multiple waypoints or curved trajectories. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures required for spline interpolation and
    movement validation. It prepares the object for subsequent method calls that define
    the actual movement path, duration, and other movement parameters.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MoveSpline instance
    code: 'MoveSpline spline;

      // The spline object is now initialized and ready for movement configuration'
    language: cpp
  notes: The MoveSpline class is typically used internally by the TrinityCore movement
    system. Developers should not directly instantiate this class but rather use it
    through higher-level APIs such as MovementGenerator or Unit::MoveSpline(). The
    constructor does not perform any actual movement calculations; it only sets up
    the object for later configuration.
