  class: BehaviorManager
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BehaviorManager::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the behavior manager's internal systems and data structures for
    AI behavior execution.
  description: The Initialize method sets up all necessary components and configurations
    required for the BehaviorManager to function properly within the TrinityCore environment.
    It typically handles loading of behavior definitions, initializing internal state
    machines, setting up event listeners, and preparing any required resources for
    AI decision-making processes. This method should be called once during the system
    initialization phase before any AI behaviors are expected to be executed. The
    method returns true if all initialization steps complete successfully, or false
    if any critical setup fails.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the behavior manager was successfully initialized with
    all required components and resources; returns false if initialization failed
    due to missing dependencies, configuration errors, or system resource issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = new BehaviorManager();\nif (behaviorMgr->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Initialization successful\n    // AI behaviors can now be used\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"server\"\
      , \"Failed to initialize BehaviorManager\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when a new AI system
    needs to be activated. It's important to note that this method may perform blocking
    operations during resource loading, so it should not be called from time-critical
    code paths. The behavior manager may cache loaded behaviors for performance reasons.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to memory
    leaks or inconsistent internal states. Ensure that any previous initialization
    state is properly cleaned up before calling this method again.
