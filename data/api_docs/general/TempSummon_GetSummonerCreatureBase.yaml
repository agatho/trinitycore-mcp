  method: GetSummonerCreatureBase
  signature: Creature * TempSummon::GetSummonerCreatureBase() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base creature object of the summoner that created this temporary
    summon.
  description: The GetSummonerCreatureBase method retrieves the original Creature
    object that summoned this TempSummon instance. This is typically used in creature
    AI and summoning mechanics to access properties or behavior of the summoning creature.
    The returned pointer may be null if the summoner has been destroyed or is not
    a valid creature. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, temporary
    summons are often created through spell effects or AI behaviors, and this method
    allows access to the summoner's base creature data for conditional logic or interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Creature object that summoned this TempSummon, or nullptr
    if the summoner is invalid or has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Summoner's Health
    code: "Creature* summoner = tempSummon->GetSummonerCreatureBase();\nif (summoner)\n\
      {\n    uint32 summonerHealth = summoner->GetHealth();\n    // Use summoner health\
      \ for some logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Summoner Type
    code: "Creature* summoner = tempSummon->GetSummonerCreatureBase();\nif (summoner\
      \ && summoner->GetEntry() == 12345)\n{\n    // Perform special behavior for\
      \ specific summoner type\n    tempSummon->AI()->DoAction(ACTION_SPECIAL_BEHAVIOR);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in AI scripts to determine the summoner's properties
    or to maintain relationships between summoned creatures and their creators. The
    returned Creature pointer should always be validated for null before use, as the
    summoner may have been removed from the world or destroyed.
  warnings: Never assume the returned pointer is valid without checking for nullptr.
    If the summoner creature has been despawned or deleted, this method will return
    a null pointer, which could lead to crashes if not properly handled.
