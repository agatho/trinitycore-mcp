  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: GetItemBaseValue
  signature: uint32 PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetItemBaseValue(uint32 itemClass)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the base value associated with a specified item class for trade
    calculations in player bot behavior.
  description: The GetItemBaseValue method retrieves a predefined base value that
    corresponds to a given item class. This value is used internally by the player
    bot AI system to evaluate the worth of items during trading decisions. The method
    likely maps item classes (such as weapons, armor, consumables, etc.) to numerical
    values that help determine trade strategies and item prioritization. It serves
    as a foundational component in the bot's economic decision-making process within
    the context of World of Warcraft's trading mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the base value assigned to the specified
    item class. This value typically indicates the relative worth or priority of items
    within that class for trade purposes, with higher values suggesting more valuable
    or desirable items.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve base value for weapon items
    code: 'uint32 baseValue = playerbotTradeConfig->GetItemBaseValue(ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON);

      // Returns the base value used for evaluating weapons during trade decisions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerbotTradeConfig class which is designed to
    support AI-driven trading behaviors in TrinityCore's player bot system. The actual
    mapping between item classes and their base values is likely defined in configuration
    files or hardcoded within the implementation.
