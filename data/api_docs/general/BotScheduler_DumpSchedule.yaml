  brief: Dumps the current bot scheduling information to the console or log output.
  description: The DumpSchedule method outputs all scheduled bot activities and their
    timing information to the system log or console. This method is typically used
    for debugging purposes to inspect the internal state of the bot scheduler, including
    active tasks, queued actions, and execution timelines. It provides visibility
    into how bots are scheduled to perform various in-game actions such as movement,
    combat, or quest progression. The output includes details about each scheduled
    event, their associated bot identifiers, and the time at which they are set to
    execute.
