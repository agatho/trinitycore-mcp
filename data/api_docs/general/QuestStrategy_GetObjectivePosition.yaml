  class: QuestStrategy
  method: GetObjectivePosition
  signature: int QuestStrategy::GetObjectivePosition(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the position index of a specified quest objective for bot AI navigation.
  description: The GetObjectivePosition method determines the positional index of
    a given quest objective within the bot's current quest strategy. This index is
    used by the AI to navigate to specific locations associated with quest completion.
    The method takes a BotAI instance and an objective identifier, then returns an
    integer representing the position in the quest's objective sequence. This functionality
    is essential for bots to properly follow quest paths and complete objectives in
    the correct order. The method assumes that the bot has an active quest and that
    the objective index is valid within the current quest context.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the bot's behavior and quest
      state
  - name: objective
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific quest objective to locate
      within the current quest strategy
  returns: Returns an integer representing the position index of the specified quest
    objective in the current quest's objective sequence. A negative value typically
    indicates an error or invalid objective, while a positive integer represents a
    valid position index starting from zero.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get objective position
    code: "int position = strategy->GetObjectivePosition(ai, 2);\nif (position >=\
      \ 0) {\n    // Use position to navigate to objective location\n    printf(\"\
      Objective at position: %d\\n\", position);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ objective\n    printf(\"Invalid objective specified\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using objective position for bot navigation
    code: "QuestStrategy* strategy = ai->GetQuestStrategy();\nint objectiveId = ai->GetCurrentObjective();\n\
      int position = strategy->GetObjectivePosition(ai, objectiveId);\nif (position\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // Navigate to the specific objective position\n    ai->MoveToObjective(position);\n\
      } else {\n    // Fallback behavior when objective is invalid\n    ai->CompleteQuest();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the BotAI instance maintaining valid quest state and
    objective tracking. The returned position index should be used immediately as
    the quest state may change during execution. Performance is generally fast as
    it involves simple lookup operations within the quest strategy data structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI instance has an active quest before calling this
    method, otherwise the result may be undefined. The objective parameter must represent
    a valid objective within the current quest context to avoid returning invalid
    positions.
