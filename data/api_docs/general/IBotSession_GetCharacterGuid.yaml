  class: IBotSession
  method: GetCharacterGuid
  signature: int IBotSession::GetCharacterGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character associated with
    this session.
  description: The GetCharacterGuid method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    assigned to the bot character within the TrinityCore instance. This GUID is essential
    for identifying and referencing the specific bot character in database operations,
    network communications, and game logic interactions. The returned value typically
    corresponds to the creature or player GUID stored in the database, ensuring consistent
    identification across different systems and sessions. This method does not perform
    any validation or lookup operations; it simply returns the cached or internally
    stored GUID value for the associated character.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character.
    This value is typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies the character
    within the game world's database system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int guid = session->GetCharacterGuid();\nif (guid > 0)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Bot character GUID: \" << guid << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID for Database Queries
    code: 'int botGuid = session->GetCharacterGuid();

      std::string query = "SELECT * FROM characters WHERE guid = " + std::to_string(botGuid);

      // Execute query using database connection'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the session has been properly initialized with a
    valid character. If called before the bot character is fully loaded or configured,
    it may return an invalid GUID value (typically 0). The returned GUID should be
    treated as immutable during the session lifetime.
  warnings: Do not use the returned GUID for direct database manipulation without
    proper validation. Ensure that the session is active and the character has been
    properly initialized before calling this method to avoid returning stale or invalid
    identifiers.
