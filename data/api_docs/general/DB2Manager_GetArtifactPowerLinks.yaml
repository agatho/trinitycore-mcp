  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetArtifactPowerLinks(uint32 artifactPowerId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the linked artifact power IDs for a given artifact power identifier.
  description: The GetArtifactPowerLinks method returns a constant pointer to an array
    of integers representing the linked artifact power IDs associated with the specified
    artifact power ID. This functionality is used within the TrinityCore framework
    to manage and retrieve relationships between different artifact powers in the
    game's artifact system. The returned array is typically used for validating or
    traversing artifact power connections, such as determining which powers are linked
    to a specific artifact power node. The method accesses internal DB2 data structures
    that store artifact power link information, making it essential for artifact-related
    gameplay mechanics and UI display logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing the linked artifact
    power IDs. Returns NULL if no links are found or if the provided artifactPowerId
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Artifact Power Links
    code: "const int* links = sDB2Manager->GetArtifactPowerLinks(12345);\nif (links\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ARTIFACT_POWER_LINKS && links[i]\
      \ != -1; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Linked Power ID: %d\\n\", links[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal DB2 data structures and should only be called
    after the DB2 files have been loaded. The returned pointer is valid only until
    the next call to GetArtifactPowerLinks or until the DB2Manager instance is destroyed.
    The array is terminated by a -1 sentinel value, indicating the end of the linked
    power IDs.
  warnings: The returned pointer must not be modified or freed as it points to internal
    data structures. Calling this method with an invalid artifactPowerId may return
    NULL or undefined behavior. Ensure that the DB2Manager has been initialized before
    calling this method.
