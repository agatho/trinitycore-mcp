  class: CollectionMgr
  method: AddMount
  signature: bool CollectionMgr::AddMount(uint32 spellId, MountStatusFlags flags,
    bool factionMount, bool learned)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a mount to the player's collection with specified flags and learning
    status.
  description: The AddMount method adds a mount spell to the player's collection in
    TrinityCore. It allows setting various flags that define the mount's behavior,
    such as whether it's a faction-specific mount or if it should be marked as learned.
    This method is typically used for granting mounts through quests, achievements,
    or custom scripts. The method returns true if the mount was successfully added
    to the collection, and false otherwise. It interacts with the player's mount collection
    system and updates the relevant database entries accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the mount spell to be added. This must correspond
      to a valid mount spell in the game's spell database.
  - name: flags
    description: Flags that define the mount's properties and behavior. These are
      typically MountStatusFlags values that control how the mount is displayed or
      used by the player.
  - name: factionMount
    description: Indicates whether this mount is specific to a particular faction
      (Alliance or Horde). If true, the mount will only be available to players of
      that faction.
  - name: learned
    description: Determines if the mount should be marked as learned by the player.
      If true, the mount will appear in the player's mount collection immediately.
  returns: Returns true if the mount was successfully added to the player's collection;
    returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters or other issues.
  examples:
  - title: Add a basic mount
    code: "if (collectionMgr->AddMount(45522, MOUNT_STATUS_FLAG_NORMAL, false, true))\
      \ {\n    // Mount successfully added\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Add a faction-specific mount
    code: "if (collectionMgr->AddMount(61425, MOUNT_STATUS_FLAG_FACTION_SPECIFIC,\
      \ true, false)) {\n    // Faction-specific mount added but not yet learned\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the player's collection data and may
    trigger updates to the client-side mount display. It is recommended to call this
    method only when necessary, as frequent calls could impact performance. The spellId
    parameter must reference a valid mount spell in the database.
  warnings: Do not use invalid spell IDs as they will cause the method to fail silently.
    Be cautious when setting factionMount to true, as incorrect usage may result in
    mounts that are not accessible to players of the opposite faction. Ensure that
    flags are properly set according to the intended behavior of the mount.
