documentation:
  brief: Selects nearby targets for spell effects based on implicit target information
  description: This method determines and selects nearby targets for spell effects
    by utilizing the provided SpellEffectInfo and SpellImplicitTargetInfo parameters.
    It processes target selection logic according to the specified target index and
    effect mask, enabling proper targeting of spells that require nearby targets such
    as area-of-effect spells or crowd-control abilities. The method is crucial for
    handling spell targeting mechanics in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    particularly when dealing with spells that have multiple target types or require
    specific target selection criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the spell effect being processed, including
      effect type, target type, and other relevant parameters for determining target
      selection
  - name: targetType
    description: Provides implicit target information that defines how targets should
      be selected, including target types and their associated rules for target selection
  - name: targetIndex
    description: Represents the specific index of the target being selected, allowing
      for precise targeting of individual targets within a spell's target list
  - name: effMask
    description: Effect mask that determines which effects are considered when selecting
      targets, enabling selective processing based on effect types and their corresponding
      target selection rules
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Selection Example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitNearbyTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex,
      effMask);

      // This selects nearby targets for a spell effect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Target Selection with Multiple Effects
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

      spell->SelectImplicitNearbyTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex,
      effMask);

      // This handles multiple effects in a single spell

      // where each effect may have different target selection rules'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell targeting system and should be used
    carefully during spell processing. It relies on proper target type information
    and effect mask handling to function correctly. Performance considerations include
    avoiding unnecessary target calculations when multiple targets are processed.
  warnings: Improper handling of target selection parameters may result in incorrect
    targeting or missing targets for spells. Care must be taken when using this method
    with spells that have multiple effects, as different effects may require different
    target selection logic.
