  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the Discipline Priest

    mana regeneration buffs, spell power enhancements, and other beneficial effects
    that influence the priest's performance in combat. The method typically iterates
    through the priest's active aura list, checks for expiration conditions, and applies
    necessary updates to maintain optimal gameplay state. It ensures that all buffs
    are properly maintained according to game mechanics and class-specific rules.
