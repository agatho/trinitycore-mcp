  method: Initialize
  signature: void ComboPointSystem::Initialize(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the combo point system for a bot character
  description: The Initialize method sets up the combo point tracking system for a
    bot character, preparing it to manage combo points for abilities like Sinister
    Strike, Eviscerate, and other finishers. This method typically configures internal
    data structures and resets combo point counters to their default state. It is
    usually called during bot initialization or when a new combat session begins.
    The method ensures that the bot's combo point system is properly synchronized
    with the game's combat mechanics and player state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character instance that will have its combo point
      system initialized
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'ComboPointSystem comboSystem;

      Bot* myBot = new Bot();

      comboSystem.Initialize(&myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization in Combat Context
    code: "void OnCombatStart(Bot* bot)\n{\n    ComboPointSystem comboSystem;\n  \
      \  comboSystem.Initialize(&bot);\n    // Bot is now ready to track combo points\
      \ during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may cause unexpected behavior or memory leaks. The method assumes
    the bot pointer is valid and properly allocated.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely result in a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure the bot object exists and is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
