  class: AuctionManager
  method: CalculatePriceTrends
  signature: void AuctionManager::CalculatePriceTrends(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates price trends for a specific item in the auction house
    system.
  description: The CalculatePriceTrends method processes auction data to determine
    current market price trends for the specified item. It analyzes recent bids, buyouts,
    and sales to compute statistical measures such as average price, highest bid,
    and lowest sell price. This information is used by the auction house system to
    dynamically adjust pricing strategies and provide players with accurate market
    insights. The method typically runs periodically or in response to significant
    auction activity for the item. It requires that the item exists in the auction
    database and that sufficient auction data is available for meaningful trend analysis.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which price trends are calculated.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Calculate price trends for a common weapon
    code: AuctionManager::CalculatePriceTrends(12345); // Calculates trends for a
      specific sword
    language: cpp
  - title: Update trends for multiple items in loop
    code: "for (uint32 itemId : itemIds)\n{\n    AuctionManager::CalculatePriceTrends(itemId);\n\
      }\n// Updates price trends for a list of items"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to gather auction data and may
    be computationally intensive when processing many items. It's typically called
    from a background thread or during maintenance windows to avoid impacting gameplay
    performance.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId may result in undefined behavior
    or database errors. Ensure the item exists in the game database before calling
    this function.
