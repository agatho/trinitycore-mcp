  method: IsLeaderMoving
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsLeaderMoving() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the leader unit is currently moving in the leader-follow behavior
    system.
  description: The IsLeaderMoving method determines whether the leader unit within
    a LeaderFollowBehavior instance is actively moving. This method is typically used
    in AI systems to control follower units' behavior based on the leader's movement
    state. It evaluates the current movement status of the leader and returns true
    if the leader is moving, false otherwise. The implementation likely checks the
    leader's velocity, position changes over time, or internal movement flags to make
    this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the leader unit is currently
    moving. True indicates the leader is moving; false indicates the leader is stationary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check leader movement
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior->IsLeaderMoving()) {\n    // Handle follower behavior\
      \ when leader is moving\n    follower->MoveTo(leader->GetPosition());\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle follower behavior when leader is stationary\n    follower->StopMoving();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a movement decision loop
    code: "void UpdateFollowerBehavior(LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior) {\n    if (behavior->IsLeaderMoving())\
      \ {\n        // Follower should follow leader's path\n        behavior->SetFollowerState(FOLLOWER_MOVING);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Follower should stay near leader or perform idle actions\n\
      \        behavior->SetFollowerState(FOLLOWER_IDLE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely performance-sensitive as it may be called frequently
    during AI updates. The implementation might use cached movement states rather
    than real-time position checks for efficiency. Developers should consider that
    movement state changes might not be immediate and could have a small delay depending
    on the underlying AI update cycle.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in tight loops as frequent calls may
    impact performance. The return value reflects the last known movement state, which
    may not always match real-time movement due to potential synchronization delays
    or caching mechanisms.
