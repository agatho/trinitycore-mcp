documentation:
  brief: Cancels the currently executing AI action for the bot
  description: The CancelCurrentAction method terminates any ongoing AI behavior or
    action that the bot is currently performing. This method is typically used to
    interrupt actions such as movement, casting spells, or interacting with objects.
    It resets the bot's current action state and allows the AI to resume normal decision-making
    processes. The method does not take any parameters and has no return value, making
    it a simple control mechanism for managing bot behavior flow.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = player->GetBotAI();

      botAI->CancelCurrentAction();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cancel Action Before Casting Spell
    code: "if (botAI->GetCurrentAction() != BotAI::ACTION_CASTING)\n{\n    botAI->CancelCurrentAction();\n\
      \    botAI->CastSpell(target, spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may interrupt important actions
    like combat abilities or movement sequences. The AI will typically resume its
    normal behavior after cancellation, but any resources allocated for the current
    action may not be properly cleaned up.
  warnings: Calling this method during critical actions such as casting high-priority
    spells or while in combat may result in unexpected behavior. Always verify that
    canceling an action is safe before invoking this method.
