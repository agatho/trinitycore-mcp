documentation:
  brief: Calculates bonus honor awarded for a kill in a battleground based on the
    number of kills.
  description: The GetBonusHonorFromKill method computes the additional honor points
    a player receives for eliminating an opponent during a battleground match. This
    calculation takes into account the number of kills already achieved by the player
    and applies diminishing returns or scaling factors as defined by the battleground's
    rules. The method is typically used internally by the game engine to determine
    reward values when processing kill events in battlegrounds such as Warsong Gulch,
    Arathi Basin, or Eye of the Storm. It does not modify any internal state but simply
    returns a calculated value based on the provided kill count.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the bonus honor points awarded for the
    specified number of kills in the current battleground context. The value may vary
    depending on the battleground type, player's current kill count, and game balance
    settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine bonus honor
    code: 'int bonusHonor = bg->GetBonusHonorFromKill(3);

      // Returns the bonus honor for the third kill in the battleground'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a kill processing function
    code: "void ProcessPlayerKill(Battleground* bg, int kills) {\n    int bonus =\
      \ bg->GetBonusHonorFromKill(kills);\n    player->AddHonorPoints(bonus);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground system's reward calculation logic
    and is intended for internal use. The exact formula applied may vary between different
    battleground types and game versions. Developers should not assume a fixed honor
    value per kill; instead, they should rely on this method to provide accurate calculations.
  warnings: Do not call this method with negative kill counts as it may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect honor calculations. Ensure that the battleground instance
    is valid before calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
