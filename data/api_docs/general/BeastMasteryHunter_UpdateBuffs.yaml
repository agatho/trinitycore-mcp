  class: BeastMasteryHunter
  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunter::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's beast mastery buffs based on current pet status and
    aura effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and applying all
    relevant buff effects associated with the Beast Mastery hunter specialization.
    This includes updating auras, modifying stat bonuses, and ensuring that the hunter's
    pet-related abilities are properly reflected in their character's active buffs.
    The method typically triggers during key events such as pet summoning, aura expiration,
    or when the hunter's specialization state changes. It ensures that all Beast Mastery-specific
    enhancements remain synchronized with the current game state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void UpdateBuffs() {\n    // Called when pet enters combat\n    if (m_pet\
      \ && m_pet->IsInCombat())\n        ApplyBeastMasteryAuras();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Event Handling
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunter::UpdateBuffs() {\n    // Update buffs when pet\
      \ state changes\n    if (m_pet && m_pet->GetEntry() != 0)\n        m_pet->AddAura(12345,\
      \ this); // Example aura\n    else\n        RemoveAura(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever there is a change in pet status or
    aura state to ensure proper synchronization of Beast Mastery effects. It may involve
    multiple internal calls to aura management functions and should not be invoked
    excessively during high-frequency events.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method directly from within combat loops without checking
    for redundant updates, as it may cause performance degradation due to repeated
    aura recalculations.
