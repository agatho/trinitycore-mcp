documentation:
  brief: Dumps packet sniffing statistics to the console or log file
  description: The DumpStatistics method outputs collected packet sniffing data from
    the PlayerbotPacketSniffer class. This includes information about captured packets,
    their types, sizes, and processing times. The method is typically used for debugging
    and performance analysis of player bot communication with the game server. It
    aggregates data from all active sniffing sessions and presents it in a structured
    format to help developers understand network behavior and optimize bot performance.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerbotPacketSniffer* sniffer = PlayerbotAI::GetPacketSniffer();\nif\
      \ (sniffer)\n{\n    sniffer->DumpStatistics();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have performance implications when called frequently during
    active bot operations, as it processes and formats potentially large amounts of
    collected data. The output is typically directed to the server's log file or console
    depending on the logging configuration.
