documentation:
  brief: Applies necessary buffs to the bot's character based on priest baseline rotation
    logic.
  description: 'The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for applying essential buff spells
    to the bot''s character during combat or non-combat scenarios. It evaluates the
    current state of the bot and applies appropriate buffs such as Power Word: Fortitude,
    Inner Fire, or other relevant priest abilities depending on the baseline rotation
    strategy. This method ensures that the bot maintains optimal stat bonuses and
    defensive capabilities in accordance with standard priest gameplay mechanics.'

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_bot->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        m_rotation->ApplyBuffs(&m_bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI updates to ensure that the
    bot maintains proper buff status. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific rotation strategy being used, and it's recommended to check for existing
    buffs before applying new ones to avoid redundant spell casts.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot has sufficient mana before calling this method, as
    applying multiple buffs can consume significant resources. Also, be aware that
    some buffs might conflict with each other, so proper logic should be implemented
    to handle such cases.
