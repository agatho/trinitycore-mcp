  class: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  method: HandleCooldowns
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::HandleCooldowns(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages and updates the cooldown state of Windwalker Monk abilities for a
    target.
  description: The HandleCooldowns method is responsible for processing and updating
    the cooldown timers associated with various Windwalker Monk abilities. This method
    ensures that abilities are properly managed according to their cooldown mechanics,
    preventing players from using skills before they are ready. It typically iterates
    through the monk's ability list, checks if each skill is on cooldown, and updates
    the internal state accordingly. The method may also handle synchronization of
    cooldowns with the game server to maintain consistency across all clients.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      for which cooldowns are being processed. This parameter is used to determine
      which specific target's abilities should have their cooldown states updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      windwalkerMonk->HandleCooldowns(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Targets
    code: "std::vector<int> targets = {1, 5, 10, 15};\nfor (int target : targets)\
      \ {\n    windwalkerMonk->HandleCooldowns(&target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    cooldowns are accurately tracked. The target parameter is crucial for determining
    which abilities and cooldowns need updating, especially in multi-target scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing an invalid or null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. This method
    modifies internal cooldown states and should not be called concurrently from multiple
    threads without proper synchronization.
