  brief: Processes and settles completed auction transactions in the economy system
  description: The ProcessAuctionSales method handles the settlement of all completed
    auctions within the TrinityCore economy manager. This function iterates through
    the auction house system, identifies sold items, transfers gold from buyers to
    sellers, updates item ownership, and removes completed auctions from the system.
    It ensures proper economic balance and maintains the integrity of the in-game
    marketplace by executing all necessary financial transactions for successful bids.
    The method typically runs periodically as part of the server's economy maintenance
    cycle.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EconomyManager* econMgr = sEconomyManager;

      econMgr->ProcessAuctionSales();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server maintenance periods or as
    part of scheduled economy updates to avoid disrupting active gameplay. The function
    may block briefly while processing multiple auction transactions simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-traffic periods may cause temporary performance
    degradation due to the intensive database operations required for transaction
    settlement. Ensure proper locking mechanisms are in place if called from multiple
    threads.
