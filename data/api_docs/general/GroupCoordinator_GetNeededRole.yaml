  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: GetNeededRole
  signature: GroupRole GroupCoordinator::GetNeededRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role that is currently needed by the group coordinator.
  description: The GetNeededRole method returns the GroupRole enum value indicating
    which role is currently required or desired within the group managed by this GroupCoordinator
    instance. This functionality is typically used in group management systems to
    determine what type of player or class is needed to complete a group composition,
    such as for dungeon or raid instances where specific roles (tank, healer, damage
    dealer) are required. The method does not modify any internal state and provides
    a read-only view of the current role requirement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupRole enum value representing the type of role currently needed by
    the group coordinator. Possible values include but are not limited to GROUP_ROLE_TANK,
    GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE, or GROUP_ROLE_NONE if no specific role is
    required.
  examples:
  - title: Check Required Role in Group
    code: "GroupRole neededRole = groupCoordinator->GetNeededRole();\nif (neededRole\
      \ == GROUP_ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Handle tank requirement\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Tank role is needed in the group.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently to monitor dynamic role requirements
    within a group. It's typically used in conjunction with player role assignment
    logic and group matching systems.
