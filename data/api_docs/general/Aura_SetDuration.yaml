  class: Aura
  method: SetDuration
  signature: void Aura::SetDuration(int32 duration, bool withMods)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration of the aura, optionally applying modifiers.
  description: The SetDuration method updates the remaining time left on an aura.
    It allows for setting a new duration value, with an optional parameter to apply
    modifiers such as haste or duration reductions. This method is typically used
    during aura application, modification, or reset operations within the TrinityCore
    framework. The duration is specified in milliseconds and can be adjusted based
    on game mechanics like spell modifiers, talent effects, or aura stacking rules.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The new duration value for the aura in milliseconds. Negative values
      may indicate infinite duration or special behavior depending on implementation.
  - name: withMods
    description: If true, applies spell modifiers and haste effects to the duration.
      If false, sets the duration directly without modifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Duration Setting
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetDuration(30000,\
      \ true); // Set to 30 seconds with modifiers\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Direct Duration Override
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetDuration(60000,\
      \ false); // Set to 60 seconds without modifiers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal aura update events and should not be called
    during active aura iteration. The duration is stored internally as a millisecond
    value and affects the aura's expiration time calculation.
  warnings: Modifying aura durations directly can interfere with game balance or cause
    unexpected behavior if not properly validated against spell effects or modifiers.
    Avoid calling this method from within aura application handlers to prevent recursion
    issues.
