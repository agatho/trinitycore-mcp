  class: Quest
  method: GetFlagsEx
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetFlagsEx() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the extended flags of the quest, which determine specific quest behaviors
    and properties.
  description: The GetFlagsEx method retrieves the extended flags associated with
    a quest object, providing detailed information about quest-specific behaviors
    and properties. These flags control various aspects such as quest completion conditions,
    reward types, and special quest mechanics. The method is commonly used in quest
    scripts and event handling to determine how quests should be processed or displayed
    in-game. This function is essential for developers working with quest systems
    and can help identify specific quest characteristics based on flag values.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the extended flags of the quest. Each
    bit in this value corresponds to different quest properties, such as whether a
    quest requires specific items, has special completion conditions, or is related
    to certain quest types like daily or repeatable quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 flags = quest->GetFlagsEx();\nif (flags & QUEST_FLAGS_EX_SPECIAL_QUEST)\n\
      {\n    // Handle special quest behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with flag checking
    code: "uint32 flags = quest->GetFlagsEx();\nuint32 questType = flags & 0xFF;\n\
      switch (questType)\n{\n    case QUEST_FLAGS_EX_REPEATABLE:\n        // Handle\
      \ repeatable quest logic\n        break;\n    case QUEST_FLAGS_EX_DAILY:\n \
      \       // Handle daily quest logic\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The flags value
    returned by GetFlagsEx is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods to determine quest behavior. Developers should be aware that flag values
    may change between different patch versions of TrinityCore, so compatibility checks
    are recommended.
  warnings: The flags returned by this method should not be modified directly as they
    represent immutable quest properties. If developers need to modify quest flags,
    they should use the appropriate setter methods instead of modifying the flags
    directly.
