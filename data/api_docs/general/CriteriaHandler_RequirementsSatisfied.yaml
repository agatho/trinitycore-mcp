  signature: bool CriteriaHandler::RequirementsSatisfied(const Criteria * criteria,
    uint64 miscValue1, uint64 miscValue2, uint64 miscValue3, const WorldObject * ref,
    Player * referencePlayer) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether all requirements for a given criteria are satisfied by
    the provided reference data.
  description: The RequirementsSatisfied method determines if a specified Criteria
    object's conditions are met based on the input parameters. It evaluates various
    factors such as player status, object references, and miscellaneous values to
    decide whether the criteria has been fulfilled. This function is commonly used
    in achievement systems, quest tracking, and other game mechanics that require
    conditional checks against defined criteria. The method takes into account the
    context provided by the reference object and player, making it suitable for complex
    scenario-based evaluations.
  parameters:
  - name: criteria
    description: Pointer to the Criteria object that defines the conditions to be
      checked. Must not be null.
  - name: miscValue1
    description: First miscellaneous value used for criteria evaluation. Can represent
      various data depending on the criteria type, such as item ID or quest ID.
  - name: miscValue2
    description: Second miscellaneous value used for criteria evaluation. Often represents
      secondary data like count or specific flag values.
  - name: miscValue3
    description: Third miscellaneous value used for criteria evaluation. May be used
      for additional context or complex condition checks.
  - name: ref
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that serves as a reference point for evaluation.
      Can be null if no specific object is relevant.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object that provides context for player-specific
      criteria checks. Must not be null for player-related evaluations.
  returns: Returns true if all requirements defined in the criteria are satisfied
    by the provided data, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check achievement criteria
    code: "Criteria* myCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(12345);\nPlayer* player\
      \ = ...;\nWorldObject* target = ...;\nbool satisfied = criteriaHandler->RequirementsSatisfied(myCriteria,\
      \ 1001, 0, 0, target, player);\nif (satisfied)\n{\n    // Handle achievement\
      \ unlock\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple misc values
    code: "Criteria* questCriteria = sObjectMgr->GetCriteria(54321);\nPlayer* player\
      \ = ...;\nWorldObject* source = ...;\nuint64 itemID = 12345;\nuint64 itemCount\
      \ = 10;\nuint64 flagValue = 0;\nbool result = criteriaHandler->RequirementsSatisfied(questCriteria,\
      \ itemID, itemCount, flagValue, source, player);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during achievement evaluation or quest progression
    checks. The implementation may vary depending on the specific criteria type and
    its associated requirements. Performance-wise, this function should be used judiciously
    in frequently executed code paths as it involves multiple conditional evaluations.
  warnings: Ensure that the referencePlayer parameter is not null, as passing a null
    pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Also, make sure that
    the criteria object is valid and properly initialized before calling this method.
