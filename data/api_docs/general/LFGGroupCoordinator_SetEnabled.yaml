  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the LFG group coordinator functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the LFG (Looking For Group)
    group coordinator is active or inactive. When enabled, the coordinator can manage
    group matching and queue operations for players seeking dungeons or raids. When
    disabled, it prevents any LFG group coordination activities. This method is typically
    used to toggle the LFG system on or off during server maintenance, testing, or
    administrative tasks. The change takes effect immediately without requiring a
    restart of the game session.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the LFG group coordinator functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable LFG Group Coordinator
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable LFG Group Coordinator
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal state of the LFG system and may
    influence player experience in group content. It should be used carefully during
    server operations or maintenance windows.
  warnings: Changing this setting while players are actively queued for groups may
    cause unexpected behavior or errors in the LFG queue system. Ensure no active
    LFG sessions are running before disabling the coordinator.
