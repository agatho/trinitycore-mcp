  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: SelectZone
  signature: ZoneChoice BotWorldPositioner::SelectZone(uint32 level, int faction,
    uint8 race)
documentation:
  brief: Selects an appropriate zone for a bot based on level, faction, and race parameters.
  description: The SelectZone method determines the most suitable game zone for a
    bot character given its level, faction, and race. This method is typically used
    during bot initialization or zone switching to ensure that bots are placed in
    zones that match their capabilities and alignment with the game world. The selection
    process considers various factors such as zone difficulty levels, player population
    distribution, and faction-specific zones to optimize gameplay experience and prevent
    imbalance. It ensures that bots are assigned to appropriate environments where
    they can contribute meaningfully to the game without overwhelming or underutilizing
    available resources.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot character, used to determine suitable zone difficulty
      ranges. Valid values are typically between 1 and 80 for standard WoW expansions.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction of the bot (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde). Determines
      which faction-specific zones may be selected based on game mechanics and world
      balance.
  - name: race
    description: The race of the bot character. Used to ensure zone selection respects
      racial restrictions or preferences in certain areas, particularly in early game
      zones where some zones are restricted by race.
  returns: Returns a ZoneChoice object that contains information about the selected
    zone including its ID, name, and possibly other metadata required for zone assignment.
    The ZoneChoice structure typically includes fields such as zone_id, zone_name,
    and potentially flags indicating suitability or restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectZone
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      uint32 botLevel = 15;

      int botFaction = 0; // Alliance

      uint8 botRace = 1; // Human

      ZoneChoice chosenZone = positioner.SelectZone(botLevel, botFaction, botRace);

      // Use chosenZone.zone_id to assign the bot to the selected zone'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple bots
    code: "BotWorldPositioner positioner;\nstd::vector<Bot*> bots = GetBots();\nfor\
      \ (auto& bot : bots) {\n    ZoneChoice zone = positioner.SelectZone(bot->GetLevel(),\
      \ bot->GetFaction(), bot->GetRace());\n    if (zone.zone_id != 0) {\n      \
      \  bot->SetCurrentZone(zone.zone_id);\n        bot->TeleportToZone(zone.zone_id);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal zone databases and balancing algorithms
    to make decisions. It may cache previously selected zones to avoid frequent recomputation,
    especially when dealing with many bots of similar characteristics. The implementation
    might also consider current server load or player density in different zones to
    distribute bots more evenly across the game world.
  warnings: Improper parameter values for level, faction, or race could result in
    invalid zone selections or errors. Ensure that faction values are either 0 (Alliance)
    or 1 (Horde), and that level is within valid range for the expansion being played.
    Using this method without proper initialization of the bot's properties may lead
    to incorrect zone assignments.
