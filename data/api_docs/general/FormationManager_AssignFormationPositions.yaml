  signature: void FormationManager::AssignFormationPositions()
documentation:
  brief: Assigns formation positions to units within the FormationManager's control.
  description: The AssignFormationPositions method calculates and applies specific
    positioning coordinates for all units managed by the FormationManager. This method
    is typically invoked when a formation needs to be updated or initialized, ensuring
    that each unit in the formation maintains its designated relative position. The
    method handles the logic of determining where each unit should be placed based
    on the formation's type, leader's current location, and other relevant factors
    such as unit size and movement constraints. It updates internal state tracking
    for all units involved in the formation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = new FormationManager();

      manager->AssignFormationPositions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the FormationManager has been properly
    initialized with a valid leader and member units. The method modifies internal
    unit positions directly, so it's important to ensure that no other systems are
    actively modifying these positions concurrently.
  warnings: Calling this method while units are in motion may result in unexpected
    positioning behavior. It should be avoided during active combat or movement operations
    unless specifically designed for dynamic formation updates.
