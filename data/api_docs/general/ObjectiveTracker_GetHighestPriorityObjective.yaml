  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: GetHighestPriorityObjective
  signature: ObjectivePriority ObjectiveTracker::GetHighestPriorityObjective(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the highest priority objective for the specified player bot from
    the objective tracker.
  description: The GetHighestPriorityObjective method determines and returns the most
    urgent or important objective currently assigned to a player bot within the objective
    tracking system. This method is typically used in AI-driven quest management or
    mission prioritization logic where the bot needs to know which task should be
    completed first based on game rules, quest progression, or other priority factors.
    The returned ObjectivePriority value encapsulates both the objective's priority
    level and its associated data, allowing the calling code to make informed decisions
    about resource allocation, pathfinding, or action execution. This method assumes
    that the player bot has an active objective tracker instance and that objectives
    have been properly registered with the system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which to retrieve
      the highest priority objective. Must not be null and must represent a valid
      player instance with an initialized objective tracker.
  returns: Returns an ObjectivePriority enum value indicating the highest priority
    objective for the specified bot. The return value contains both the priority level
    and associated objective data, allowing callers to determine what action should
    be taken next. If no objectives are registered for the bot, the method may return
    a default or invalid priority value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ObjectivePriority priority = objectiveTracker->GetHighestPriorityObjective(playerBot);\n\
      if (priority.IsValid()) {\n    // Process the highest priority objective\n \
      \   std::cout << \"Next objective: \" << priority.GetObjectiveId() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::Update()\n{\n    ObjectivePriority highest = objectiveTracker->GetHighestPriorityObjective(m_bot);\n\
      \    if (highest.IsValid())\n    {\n        switch (highest.GetPriorityLevel())\n\
      \        {\n            case OBJECTIVE_PRIORITY_HIGH:\n                // Execute\
      \ high priority task\n                break;\n            case OBJECTIVE_PRIORITY_MEDIUM:\n\
      \                // Handle medium priority task\n                break;\n  \
      \          default:\n                // Default handling\n                break;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI and quest management subsystem.
    It relies on internal objective tracking mechanisms that may be influenced by
    quest state, player level, faction reputation, or other game conditions. The performance
    of this method depends on how many objectives are registered for a given bot and
    how efficiently the priority system is implemented internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    an actual bot with an initialized objective tracker. Passing a null pointer or
    an invalid player object may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be aware
    that the returned ObjectivePriority value should always be checked for validity
    before attempting to use its contents.
