    QuestObjectiveType t, uint32 tId, uint32 required)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new quest objective data entry with specified parameters
  description: The QuestObjectiveData constructor initializes a quest objective with
    the provided parameters. This method sets up the internal state of a quest objective,
    including its quest ID, index within the quest, type of objective, target ID,
    and required count. The objective data is used by the TrinityCore quest system
    to track progress towards completing various quest objectives such as killing
    creatures, collecting items, or visiting locations. This constructor is typically
    called internally by the quest system when loading or creating quest objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: qId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest this objective belongs to. Must
      be a valid quest ID present in the database.
  - name: index
    description: The index position of this objective within the quest's objective
      list. Used for ordering and tracking progress.
  - name: t
    description: The type of quest objective, such as kill, collect, or interact.
      Must be a valid QuestObjectiveType enum value.
  - name: tId
    description: The target identifier specific to the objective type. For kills,
      this would be the creature entry ID; for items, it's the item entry ID.
  - name: required
    description: The number of times this objective must be completed. For example,
      5 kills or 10 items collected.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Kill Objective
    code: 'QuestObjectiveData killObjective(12345, 0, QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL, 1234,
      5);

      // Creates a quest objective requiring 5 kills of creature ID 1234 for quest
      12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating an Item Collection Objective
    code: 'QuestObjectiveData itemObjective(12346, 1, QUEST_OBJECTIVE_ITEM, 5678,
      10);

      // Creates a quest objective requiring 10 of item ID 5678 for quest 12346'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore quest system.
    Developers should not normally call this constructor directly unless implementing
    custom quest functionality. The parameters are validated against database entries
    to ensure they represent valid quest objectives.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values can lead to quest progression issues or crashes.
    The target ID must correspond to an existing entry in the database for the specified
    objective type. Using invalid quest IDs will result in undefined behavior.
