  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MongooseBiteTracker class
  description: The MongooseBiteTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    MongooseBiteTracker class. This class is likely used to track bite-related events
    or statistics within the context of a mongoose pet or related game mechanics in
    TrinityCore. The constructor sets up internal data structures and state variables
    required for tracking bite occurrences, durations, or other relevant metrics.
    It ensures that the tracker is properly initialized before any tracking operations
    are performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MongooseBiteTracker instance
    code: 'MongooseBiteTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track bite events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, so it should only be called during
    object instantiation. The class likely contains member variables for tracking
    bite statistics such as count, duration, or damage dealt.
