  brief: Retrieves creature addon data for a given low GUID
  description: The GetCreatureAddon method fetches addon data associated with a specific
    creature identified by its low GUID. This data typically includes information
    such as spawn coordinates, movement patterns, and other creature-specific configurations
    that are stored in the database. The method returns a pointer to an array of integers
    representing the addon data structure, which may contain multiple values depending
    on the creature's configuration. The returned pointer should be treated as read-only
    and must not be modified directly. This method is commonly used during creature
    loading and spawning processes within the TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int pointer to the addon data array for the specified creature,
    or nullptr if no addon data exists for the given GUID
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve creature addon data
    code: "int lowGuid = 12345;\nconst int* addonData = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureAddon(lowGuid);\n\
      if (addonData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process addon data\n    for (int i = 0;\
      \ i < 10; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Addon value %d: %d\\n\", i, addonData[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned data pointer points to internal memory managed by ObjectMgr.
    The data structure is typically defined in the database schema and may vary based
    on the creature's type. This method performs a lookup operation that may involve
    database queries or cached data retrieval depending on server configuration.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array directly as it points to internal data
    structures. Ensure proper null checking before accessing the returned pointer
    to avoid segmentation faults. The method assumes valid low GUID values and may
    return nullptr for invalid or non-existent entries.
