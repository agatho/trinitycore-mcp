  class: UnholyDeathKnightRefactored
  method: ConsumeRunes
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::ConsumeRunes(int type, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of runes of the given type for the unholy death
    knight
  description: The ConsumeRunes method is responsible for deducting a specified number
    of runes from the unholy death knight's rune pool. This method is typically invoked
    when abilities or spells that require rune consumption are executed. The 'type'
    parameter determines which rune type (e.g., blood, frost, unholy) is consumed,
    while the 'count' parameter specifies how many runes of that type should be consumed.
    The method ensures proper rune management and prevents over-consumption by validating
    available rune counts before proceeding with the deduction.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of rune to consume (0 = Blood, 1 = Frost, 2 = Unholy). Defines
      which rune pool is affected.
  - name: count
    description: The number of runes to consume from the specified rune type. Must
      be a positive integer not exceeding available runes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume One Unholy Rune
    code: 'UnholyDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunes(2, 1); // Consumes one unholy rune'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume Multiple Blood Runes
    code: 'UnholyDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->ConsumeRunes(0, 3); // Consumes three blood runes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the death knight has sufficient runes
    available. It's typically used internally by spell or ability systems to manage
    rune consumption. The method does not directly handle rune regeneration; it assumes
    that the caller ensures proper rune availability.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking rune availability may lead to invalid
    rune states or undefined behavior. Ensure that the count parameter does not exceed
    available runes for the specified type.
