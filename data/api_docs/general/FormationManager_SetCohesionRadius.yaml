  method: SetCohesionRadius
  signature: void FormationManager::SetCohesionRadius(float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cohesion radius for the formation manager, defining how closely
    units should stay together in a group.
  description: The SetCohesionRadius method configures the distance threshold that
    controls how tightly units within a formation will maintain their positioning
    relative to each other. This parameter directly influences the behavior of group
    movement and positioning mechanics in World of Warcraft's AI system. The cohesion
    radius determines the maximum distance units will attempt to stay from their formation
    leader or designated positions. This method is typically used during formation
    setup or dynamic adjustment when modifying group behavior patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Cohesion Radius for a Group
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = player->GetFormationManager();

      manager->SetCohesionRadius(5.0f); // Units will stay within 5 yards of each
      other'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Formation Tightness Dynamically
    code: "if (player->GetGroup())\n{\n    FormationManager* fm = player->GetFormationManager();\n\
      \    if (player->IsInCombat())\n        fm->SetCohesionRadius(3.0f); // Tighter\
      \ formation during combat\n    else\n        fm->SetCohesionRadius(10.0f); //\
      \ Looser formation when not in combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal formation state and may trigger
    immediate recalculation of unit positions. The radius value should be positive
    and typically ranges from 1.0f to 20.0f for normal gameplay scenarios. Changes
    made to cohesion radius will only affect new movement commands issued after the
    change.
  warnings: Setting extremely small values (less than 1.0f) may cause units to become
    stuck or unable to move properly due to collision detection issues. Setting very
    large values may result in unrealistic group positioning behavior, especially
    in crowded environments.
