  brief: Leaves the LFG channel, removing the player from the group finder queue
  description: This method removes the player from the LFG (Looking for Group) channel,
    effectively ending their participation in the group finder system. It clears any
    LFG-related data from the player's state and ensures they no longer receive LFG
    notifications or updates. The method is typically called when a player leaves
    a dungeon or raid instance, or when they wish to stop participating in group finding
    activities. This action is crucial for maintaining proper game state management
    and preventing unwanted LFG notifications.

    participating in group finding activities.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or while in a dungeon,
    as it may cause unexpected behavior or state issues. The player must be in a valid
    state to properly execute this method.
