  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraDummy(const AuraApplication * aurApp, uint8
    mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Executes the dummy aura effect handler for a given aura application.
  description: The HandleAuraDummy method is a virtual function in the AuraEffect
    class that processes the behavior associated with dummy auras. Dummy auras are
    special effects that do not have a direct mechanical impact but may trigger other
    actions or serve as placeholders for custom logic. This method is invoked during
    aura application and removal, depending on the mode parameter. It allows for custom
    implementation of aura behaviors without relying on standard aura mechanics. The
    method operates based on the provided AuraApplication context and the mode flag
    indicating whether the aura is being applied or removed.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura application
      context. This parameter provides access to information about the aura's target,
      caster, and other relevant data.
  - name: mode
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the mode of operation. Typically,
      this value is either 0 (application) or 1 (removal), though custom implementations
      may define additional modes.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the aura is being applied (true)
      or removed (false). This parameter is used to determine the direction of the
      effect handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Aura Effect
    code: "class MyDummyAura : public AuraEffect\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleAuraDummy(const\
      \ AuraApplication* aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const override\n    {\n \
      \       if (apply)\n        {\n            // Apply custom logic when aura is\
      \ applied\n            Unit* target = aurApp->GetTarget();\n            target->AddAura(12345,\
      \ target); // Example: Apply another aura\n        }\n        else\n       \
      \ {\n            // Remove custom logic when aura is removed\n            Unit*\
      \ target = aurApp->GetTarget();\n            target->RemoveAura(12345);\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura system and is designed to be
    overridden in custom aura effect implementations. It should not be called directly
    from outside the aura application context unless explicitly intended for internal
    use. The method signature matches the standard virtual function interface expected
    by the AuraEffect base class.
  warnings: Incorrectly handling the mode or apply parameters can lead to unexpected
    behavior, such as applying effects when they should be removed or vice versa.
    Ensure that all custom logic is thread-safe if used in concurrent environments.
