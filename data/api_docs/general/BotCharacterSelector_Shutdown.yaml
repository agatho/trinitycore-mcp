  brief: Shuts down the bot character selector, cleaning up resources and stopping
    all active selections.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the operation of the BotCharacterSelector
    by releasing any allocated resources, stopping ongoing character selection processes,
    and ensuring that no further selections are made. This method is typically invoked
    during server shutdown or when the bot system needs to be disabled. It ensures
    a clean termination of all associated bot character management operations without
    leaving any dangling references or active threads. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return value operations.

  notes: This method should only be called when the bot system is no longer needed
    or during server shutdown to prevent resource leaks. It is recommended to call
    this method before destructing the BotCharacterSelector instance.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown() while active selections are in progress may result
    in incomplete operations or data inconsistencies. Ensure all pending selections
    are completed or canceled before invoking this method.
