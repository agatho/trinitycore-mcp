  method: OnCombatEnd
  signature: void EvokerAI::OnCombatEnd()
documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and state reset when combat ends for an evoker AI.
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is invoked when an evoker AI entity exits combat
    mode. This method performs necessary cleanup operations such as resetting combat-related
    flags, clearing target information, and ensuring the AI returns to its default
    non-combat state. It is typically called by the core game loop or combat management
    system when the evoker's combat timer expires or when all enemies are defeated.
    The method ensures that the evoker's behavior transitions smoothly from active
    combat to idle status without leaving any lingering combat states or references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI logic
    code: "class MyEvokerAI : public EvokerAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd() override\
      \ {\n        // Custom cleanup before calling base implementation\n        ResetCooldowns();\n\
      \        EvokerAI::OnCombatEnd();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI lifecycle and should not be called
    manually unless implementing a custom AI behavior. The base implementation handles
    core state resets, but derived classes may override it to perform additional cleanup
    tasks.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method directly from external code as it may lead to
    inconsistent AI states or memory leaks if not properly synchronized with the game's
    combat management system.
