documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat tactics for the group coordination system based on current
    player actions and battlefield conditions.
  description: The UpdateCombatTactics method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    the tactical behavior of a group within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates
    the current state of players in the group, including their health, mana, positioning,
    and combat status, to determine optimal strategies such as focusing fire, defensive
    positioning, or coordinated spell casting. This method typically integrates with
    AI systems and group management logic to ensure that group members act cohesively
    during encounters. The update process may involve recalculating target priorities,
    adjusting role assignments, and communicating tactical changes to all group members
    through the coordination system.

  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates or when significant
    changes occur in group composition or player status. It may be invoked automatically
    by the core game loop or manually during specific tactical decisions.
