  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CleanupExpiredEvents
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CleanupExpiredEvents()
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired guild events from the coordinator's tracking system.
  description: The CleanupExpiredEvents method iterates through all currently registered
    guild events within the GuildEventCoordinator and removes any events that have
    exceeded their designated expiration time. This ensures that the coordinator does
    not maintain references to events that are no longer relevant or active in the
    game world. The method is typically invoked periodically by the game's event management
    system to keep the guild event tracking clean and efficient. It performs no direct
    communication with players or external systems; it solely manages internal event
    state.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CleanupExpiredEvents();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, ideally as part of a periodic cleanup
    routine or game tick. It is designed to be efficient and avoid locking mechanisms
    that could block other threads handling active guild events.
