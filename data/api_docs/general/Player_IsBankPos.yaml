  class: Player
  method: IsBankPos
  signature: bool Player::IsBankPos(uint8 bag, uint8 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given inventory slot is located in the bank.
  description: The IsBankPos method checks if a specific inventory slot (identified
    by bag and slot numbers) is positioned within the bank area of the player's inventory.
    This function is essential for determining bank-related operations such as item
    placement, removal, or interaction with banked items. It returns true if the slot
    corresponds to a bank position, false otherwise. The method works with both bank
    bags and regular inventory slots, making it useful for various game mechanics
    involving bank management.
  parameters:
  - name: bag
    description: The bag identifier where the slot is located. This can be a regular
      inventory bag or a bank bag (0-11).
  - name: slot
    description: The specific slot within the bag to check. This represents the position
      within the bag, typically ranging from 0-45 for regular bags.
  returns: Returns true if the specified slot is located in the bank area; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a slot is in bank
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      bool isBank = player->IsBankPos(0, 5); // Checks if slot 5 in bag 0 is in bank'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for determining bank-related operations and
    should be used in conjunction with other inventory management functions to properly
    handle bank items. Performance-wise, it's a simple lookup operation that doesn't
    require significant computational resources.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method with non-standard slot positions as
    it may lead to incorrect results if the bag or slot numbers are not valid for
    bank operations.
