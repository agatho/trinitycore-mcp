  class: TraitCurrencyEntry
  method: GetType
  signature: TraitCurrencyType TraitCurrencyEntry::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the trait currency entry.
  description: The GetType method returns the TraitCurrencyType enumeration value
    that defines the category or type of the trait currency represented by this entry.
    This is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine how the currency
    should be handled in various gameplay systems such as trait point expenditures,
    reward distributions, and UI display logic. The returned value corresponds to
    predefined types within the game's trait system architecture and is essential
    for proper integration with trait-related mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A TraitCurrencyType enumeration value indicating the specific type of
    this trait currency entry. Possible values include but are not limited to: TRAIT_CURRENCY_TYPE_NONE,
    TRAIT_CURRENCY_TYPE_GOLD, TRAIT_CURRENCY_TYPE_REPUTATION, etc., depending on the
    game''s internal definitions.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TraitCurrencyEntry const* entry = sTraitCurrencyStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    TraitCurrencyType type = entry->GetType();\n    // Use the\
      \ type for conditional logic or UI display\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any expensive operations.
    It directly accesses a cached member variable within the TraitCurrencyEntry class,
    making it safe for frequent calls during gameplay loops.
