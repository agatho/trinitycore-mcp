  class: MageAI
  method: GetSpellSchool
  signature: MageSchool MageAI::GetSpellSchool(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell school associated with a given Mage spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellSchool method determines and returns the magical school
    (such as Fire, Frost, or Arcane) that a specific Mage spell belongs to. This information
    is crucial for AI decision-making in spell selection, cooldown management, and
    resource allocation within the Mage's combat strategy. The method takes a spell
    identifier as input and maps it to its corresponding MageSchool enumeration value.
    It serves as an essential utility for Mage AI behavior logic, enabling intelligent
    spell prioritization based on school-specific mechanics like spell overlap, synergy,
    or elemental weaknesses.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a MageSchool enumeration value indicating the magical school of
    the specified spell. Possible values include FIRE, FROST, ARCANE, and others depending
    on the game's implementation. If the spell ID does not correspond to a known Mage
    spell, the method may return an invalid or default school value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MageSchool school = ai->GetSpellSchool(133); // Returns the school for\
      \ Fireball spell\nif (school == FIRE)\n{\n    // Handle fire-based spell logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Spell Selection Logic
    code: "uint32 spellId = GetNextSpellToCast();\nMageSchool currentSchool = ai->GetSpellSchool(spellId);\n\
      if (currentSchool == ARCANE)\n{\n    // Prioritize arcane spells in this situation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data tables or mappings that
    associate spell IDs with their respective schools. Developers should ensure that
    the provided spellId is valid and corresponds to a Mage-specific spell to avoid
    incorrect results. The implementation may cache school lookups for performance
    optimization.
  warnings: Using an invalid or non-Mage spell ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect school assignments. Ensure all spell IDs passed to this method are
    validated against known Mage spells before calling.
