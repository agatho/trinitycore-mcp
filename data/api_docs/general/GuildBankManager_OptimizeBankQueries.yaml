  class: GuildBankManager
  method: OptimizeBankQueries
  signature: void GuildBankManager::OptimizeBankQueries(int * guild)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes database queries for guild bank operations by reducing redundant
    or inefficient SQL calls.
  description: The OptimizeBankQueries method in GuildBankManager is designed to improve
    performance of guild bank related database interactions. It analyzes current query
    patterns and consolidates or restructures SQL operations to minimize the number
    of database hits required for common guild bank actions such as item retrieval,
    deposit, withdrawal, and log tracking. This optimization helps reduce server load
    and latency when multiple players interact with the guild bank simultaneously.
    The method typically runs during periodic maintenance or when significant changes
    occur in guild bank state, ensuring efficient resource utilization without affecting
    gameplay integrity.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      specifies which guild's bank queries should be optimized. The value must correspond
      to a valid guild ID in the database or NULL to optimize all guilds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Specific Guild
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager::OptimizeBankQueries(&guildId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing All Guilds
    code: 'int* allGuilds = nullptr;

      GuildBankManager::OptimizeBankQueries(allGuilds);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server's maintenance routines.
    Developers should not invoke this directly unless implementing custom guild bank
    optimization logic. The optimization process may temporarily lock certain database
    tables during execution to ensure consistency.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid guild ID pointer or NULL value may
    lead to undefined behavior or performance degradation. Ensure that any guild identifiers
    passed are valid before invoking the function.
