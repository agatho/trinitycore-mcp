  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: GetCapturedBases
  signature: int BattlegroundAI::GetCapturedBases(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bases captured by the specified player in the battleground.
  description: The GetCapturedBases method retrieves the count of bases captured by
    a specific player during the current battleground match. This method is typically
    used within the BattlegroundAI framework to track player performance and progress.
    The method takes an optional pointer to a player object, which if provided, will
    return the captured base count for that specific player. If no player is specified
    (or null), it may return the total captured bases across all players or behave
    according to internal logic. This functionality is essential for scoring systems,
    achievement tracking, and determining battleground victory conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a Player object representing the specific player whose
      captured bases are to be counted. If null, the method may return aggregated
      data or behave as a general query.
  returns: An integer value representing the number of bases captured by the specified
    player. Returns 0 if no bases have been captured or if the player is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get captured bases for a specific player
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player object is initialized\nint capturedBases\
      \ = bgAI->GetCapturedBases(player);\nif (capturedBases > 0)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ has captured some bases\n    sLog->outString(\"Player captured %d bases.\"\
      , capturedBases);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Get total captured bases for all players
    code: 'int totalCaptured = bgAI->GetCapturedBases(nullptr);

      sLog->outString("Total bases captured in battleground: %d", totalCaptured);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BattlegroundAI system and relies on internal state
    tracking. It's important to note that base capture counts are updated during gameplay
    and may not reflect real-time changes without proper synchronization. The method
    assumes valid player pointers and may produce undefined behavior if passed invalid
    data.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method might result in unexpected behavior
    or incorrect results depending on the implementation. Always validate player objects
    before calling this method, especially when dealing with potentially disconnected
    players.
