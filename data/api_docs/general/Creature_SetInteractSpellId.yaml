  method: SetInteractSpellId
  signature: void Creature::SetInteractSpellId(int32 interactSpellId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the interact spell ID for a creature, enabling interaction with players
    through specific spell mechanics.
  description: This method assigns a specific spell ID to a creature that determines
    how it interacts with players during quest or dialogue events. The interact spell
    ID is used to trigger specific actions when players interact with the creature,
    such as initiating quest givers or dialogues. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with other creature interaction methods to control how creatures respond
    to player actions. The spell ID should be a valid spell ID from the game database
    that corresponds to the intended interaction behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: interactSpellId
    description: The spell ID to assign for creature interaction. This value must
      be a valid spell ID from the game database, typically used for quest givers
      or dialogue interactions. A value of -1 indicates no interaction spell is set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting interact spell ID for quest givers
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetInteractSpellId(12345);

      // This sets the creature to respond with spell ID 12345 when players interact
      with it'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting default interaction spell
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetInteractSpellId(-1);

      // This sets no specific interaction spell, allowing normal creature behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects how creatures respond
    to player interactions. The spell ID must be valid and correspond to existing
    spells in the database. Setting an invalid spell ID may result in no interaction
    occurring or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Setting an interact spell ID that doesn't exist in the database can cause
    the creature to not respond properly to player interactions. Care should be taken
    to ensure the spell ID is valid and corresponds to actual game mechanics.
