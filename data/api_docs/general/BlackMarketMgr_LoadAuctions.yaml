  class: BlackMarketMgr
  method: LoadAuctions
  signature: void BlackMarketMgr::LoadAuctions()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all black market auctions from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadAuctions method initializes and populates the black market
    auction system by retrieving all active black market auctions from the database.
    This method is typically called during server startup or when the black market
    system needs to be refreshed. It processes the database entries and constructs
    internal auction objects that represent the available items for bidding. The method
    ensures that all black market auctions are properly loaded and ready for player
    interaction, including handling item data, bid information, and auction durations.
    This is a critical initialization step for the black market functionality within
    TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadBlackMarketAuctions()\n{\n    sBlackMarketMgr->LoadAuctions();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a complete refresh of black market data is required. It performs database queries
    and memory allocations, so calling it frequently may impact performance. The method
    assumes that the database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within auction processing loops or high-frequency
    update routines as it may cause database contention or performance degradation.
    Ensure that no player interactions are occurring during this load operation to
    prevent race conditions.
