  class: VoidformTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void VoidformTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the voidform tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in VoidformTracker is responsible for managing and
    synchronizing the voidform state of a player bot within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles the logic for tracking when a player enters or exits
    voidform, updating relevant timers, cooldowns, or buffs associated with the voidform
    ability. It ensures that the bot's behavior aligns with the game mechanics of
    voidform, including proper activation and deactivation sequences. The method operates
    on a single Player parameter representing the bot whose voidform state needs to
    be updated.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose voidform
      state will be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'VoidformTracker tracker;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot AI state management and should
    be called regularly during the bot's update cycle. It may involve checking for
    specific conditions such as mana levels, spell availability, or combat status
    before updating the voidform tracker.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null to prevent undefined behavior. The method assumes the player is a valid bot
    with appropriate voidform-related abilities enabled.
