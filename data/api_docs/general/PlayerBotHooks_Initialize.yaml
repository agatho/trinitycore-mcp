  signature: void PlayerBotHooks::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the player bot hooks system, setting up internal structures and
    registering necessary event handlers for bot functionality.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the PlayerBotHooks class for operation
    by establishing internal data structures, registering required event handlers
    with the game server, and configuring the hooking mechanism to intercept and process
    player bot-related events. This method must be called before any other PlayerBotHooks
    functionality can be used. It typically runs during the server startup phase or
    when a new bot instance is created. The initialization process ensures that all
    necessary resources are allocated and that the system is ready to handle bot-specific
    game events such as movement, combat, and interaction logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'PlayerBotHooks hooks;

      hooks.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a PlayerBotHooks
    instance. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    method performs no locking internally, so if used in a multi-threaded environment,
    external synchronization may be required.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can result in
    memory leaks and inconsistent state. Ensure that all bot instances are properly
    destroyed before calling Initialize again.
