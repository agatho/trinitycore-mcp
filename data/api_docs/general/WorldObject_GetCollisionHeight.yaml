  class: WorldObject
  method: GetCollisionHeight
  signature: float WorldObject::GetCollisionHeight() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the collision height of the WorldObject, which determines the vertical
    extent for collision detection.
  description: The GetCollisionHeight method retrieves the vertical collision height
    of a WorldObject, which is essential for determining how high an object can be
    considered when calculating collision with other objects or terrain. This value
    is crucial for gameplay mechanics involving line-of sight calculations, movement
    restrictions, and spatial interactions in the game world. The method returns a
    float representing the height in yards, typically used for determining whether
    an object can pass through or interact with other objects based on their vertical
    dimensions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the collision height in yards, which
    defines the vertical extent of the object for collision purposes. This value is
    typically positive and may vary based on the object's type and configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: float height = object->GetCollisionHeight();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in pathfinding and collision detection algorithms.
    It's important to note that the returned value may vary depending on the WorldObject
    type, such as creatures, gameobject, or player, and should be used carefully when
    calculating movement restrictions.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining actual height of objects
    unless explicitly needed for collision calculations. The value returned might
    not reflect real-world physical dimensions but rather a game mechanic related
    to collision detection.
