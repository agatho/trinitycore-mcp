  signature: void InstanceCoordination::HandleCoordinationError(Group * group, const
    std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Handles coordination errors within a group during instance encounters.
  description: The HandleCoordinationError method processes and manages error conditions
    that occur during group-based instance coordination in TrinityCore. This method
    is typically invoked when synchronization issues, timeout events, or invalid state
    transitions happen during dungeon or raid encounters. It ensures proper cleanup
    and notification of the group members about the failure state. The method likely
    sends error messages to players, updates internal coordination state, and may
    trigger fallback behaviors such as resetting the instance or notifying the player's
    client of the failure.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group experiencing the
      coordination error. Must not be null.
  - name: error
    description: String describing the specific error that occurred during instance
      coordination. Used for logging and client communication.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling in Instance
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (!group)\n        return;\n\n    // Simulate\
      \ a coordination error\n    sInstanceCoordination->HandleCoordinationError(group,\
      \ \"Timeout during encounter initialization\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal instance coordination system and should
    not be called directly from regular game logic unless implementing custom instance
    handling. It's designed to work in conjunction with other coordination mechanisms
    like group synchronization, encounter state management, and player communication.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null group pointer as it will likely cause
    a crash or undefined behavior. The error string should be carefully constructed
    to avoid exposing internal system details to players.
