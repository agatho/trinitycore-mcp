  method: ShouldUseCrowdControl
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::ShouldUseCrowdControl()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should apply crowd control abilities during combat.
  description: The ShouldUseCrowdControl method evaluates various combat conditions
    and AI state to decide if it is appropriate to use crowd control abilities such
    as stuns, fears, or silences. This method typically considers factors like target
    threat level, available mana, cooldowns, and the overall tactical situation. It
    serves as a decision point for the AI's behavior tree or action selection logic,
    ensuring that crowd control is used strategically rather than randomly. The method
    does not directly apply the crowd control effect but instead returns a boolean
    value indicating whether such an action should be considered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should consider using a crowd control ability in
    the current combat situation; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (combatBehavior->ShouldUseCrowdControl()) {\n    // Select and cast\
      \ a suitable crowd control spell\n    Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\n    if\
      \ (target && !target->HasAuraType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_FEAR)) {\n        // Cast fear\
      \ or similar spell\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework and should be called
    regularly during combat updates. It may integrate with internal state tracking
    such as threat levels, mana reserves, and cooldown timers to make informed decisions.
