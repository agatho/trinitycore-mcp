  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: SetTankThreatThreshold
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::SetTankThreatThreshold(float percent)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the threat threshold percentage for tank units in the threat coordinator
    system.
  description: The SetTankThreatThreshold method configures the percentage value that
    determines when a tank unit's threat level triggers specific behavior within the
    ThreatCoordinator. This threshold is used to manage aggro distribution and ensure
    proper tank positioning during combat encounters. The method updates the internal
    configuration of the threat coordinator without requiring a restart or reinitialization
    of the system. This setting directly influences how the AI handles threat management
    for tank classes such as Warriors, Paladins, and Death Knights in group and raid
    scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: percent
    description: The threat threshold percentage value (0.0 to 100.0) that defines
      when tank units are considered to have sufficient threat to maintain aggro.
      Values outside this range may be clamped or cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Tank Threat Threshold
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = sObjectAccessor->GetThreatCoordinator();

      coordinator->SetTankThreatThreshold(85.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Threat Threshold Based on Difficulty
    code: "ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = sObjectAccessor->GetThreatCoordinator();\n\
      if (difficulty == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\n    coordinator->SetTankThreatThreshold(90.0f);\n\
      else\n    coordinator->SetTankThreatThreshold(85.0f);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the global threat coordination settings which affect
    all mobs and players in the instance. Changes take immediate effect but may not
    persist across server restarts unless saved to configuration files. The value
    is typically between 75.0f and 95.0f for optimal tank performance in most encounters.
  warnings: Setting this threshold too low may cause tanks to lose aggro prematurely,
    while setting it too high can lead to inefficient threat management. Avoid using
    values outside the recommended range (0-100) as they might result in unexpected
    behavior or crashes.
