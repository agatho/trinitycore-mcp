documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the quest strategy is currently active for the specified
    bot AI instance.
  description: The IsActive method checks if a given QuestStrategy is currently active
    within the context of a specific BotAI instance. This method evaluates internal
    state flags or conditions that determine whether the strategy should be considered
    active, typically used during AI decision-making processes to filter out inactive
    strategies. The method does not modify any state and is read-only in nature. It's
    commonly invoked by the AI system when selecting appropriate quest-related actions
    or behaviors for a bot character.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest strategy is currently active for the provided
    BotAI instance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (strategy->IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Execute active strategy logic\n \
      \   strategy->Execute(ai);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    should be considered. The activation state may depend on various factors such
    as quest completion status, player level requirements, or proximity to quest givers.
