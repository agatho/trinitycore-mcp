  class: RoleAssignment
  method: GetRoleAssignmentIssues
  signature: int RoleAssignment::GetRoleAssignmentIssues(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Checks a group for role assignment issues and returns a count of detected
    problems.
  description: The GetRoleAssignmentIssues method evaluates the current role assignments
    within a specified group to identify potential conflicts or inconsistencies. It
    performs validation checks on player roles such as tank, healer, and damage dealer
    assignments, ensuring that each role is properly filled according to game mechanics
    and group composition requirements. This method is typically used during group
    creation, member changes, or raid setup to maintain proper role distribution for
    optimal performance. The method returns an integer representing the number of
    issues found, with zero indicating a valid role assignment configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the count of role assignment issues detected
    in the group. A return value of 0 indicates no issues were found, while any positive
    integer represents the number of problems identified during validation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nint issues = roleAssignment->GetRoleAssignmentIssues(myGroup);\n\
      if (issues > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"group\", \"Group has %d role assignment\
      \ issues.\", issues);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid group objects. The implementation
    may perform multiple checks including role distribution balance, required role
    availability, and player class compatibility with assigned roles. It is recommended
    to call this method before allowing a group to enter certain content types that
    require specific role configurations.
  warnings: The method does not modify the actual group roles or assignments; it only
    reports issues. Calling this method on a null group pointer will likely cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the Group pointer is valid before
    calling this method.
