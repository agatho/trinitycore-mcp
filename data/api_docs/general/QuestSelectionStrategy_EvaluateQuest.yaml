  signature: float QuestSelectionStrategy::EvaluateQuest(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a priority score for a quest based on bot's current
    state and quest requirements.
  description: The EvaluateQuest method computes a float value representing how desirable
    or suitable a given quest is for the specified bot player. This evaluation considers
    various factors such as quest level requirements, available quest items, player's
    current quest progress, and other contextual data relevant to the AI decision-making
    process. The returned score helps determine which quests should be prioritized
    by the bot when selecting actions. This method is typically used within the context
    of automated quest selection strategies in TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs to be evaluated. Must not
      be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the quest
      is being evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: A float value indicating the priority or desirability of the quest for
    the given bot. Higher values indicate higher priority. A negative value may indicate
    that the quest should not be pursued.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest selection logic
    code: "float score = strategy.EvaluateQuest(quest, bot);\nif (score > 0.5f) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with accepting or working on this quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using evaluation to select best quest from multiple options
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nQuest* bestQuest = nullptr;\nfor (auto& q : availableQuests)\
      \ {\n    float score = strategy.EvaluateQuest(q, bot);\n    if (score > bestScore)\
      \ {\n        bestScore = score;\n        bestQuest = q;\n    }\n}\nif (bestQuest\
      \ && bestScore > 0.0f) {\n    // Select the best quest based on evaluation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a strategy pattern used in AI quest selection logic.
    It does not modify any state directly but rather provides an assessment for decision-making
    purposes. The implementation likely checks player level, quest prerequisites,
    reputation requirements, and other conditions to compute the evaluation score.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'quest' and 'bot' parameters are valid non-null pointers
    before calling this method. Passing null values may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The returned float value should be interpreted carefully as it's a
    relative score used for comparison rather than an absolute measure.
