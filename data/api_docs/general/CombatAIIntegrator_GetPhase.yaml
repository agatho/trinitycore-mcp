documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current combat phase state of the AI integrator
  description: The GetPhase method returns the active combat phase that the CombatAIIntegrator
    is currently operating within. This phase determines the behavior and decision-making
    logic of the AI during different stages of combat, such as pre-combat, engagement,
    or post-combat states. The returned CombatPhase value represents a specific state
    in the AI's combat lifecycle which influences how the AI processes targets, selects
    abilities, and manages its overall tactical approach.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CombatPhase enum value indicating the current phase of combat behavior.
    Possible values may include PHASE_NONE, PHASE_PRECOMBAT, PHASE_COMBAT, PHASE_POSTCOMBAT,
    or other phase-specific states depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Retrieval
    code: "CombatPhase currentPhase = aiIntegrator->GetPhase();\nif (currentPhase\
      \ == PHASE_COMBAT)\n{\n    // AI is currently in combat mode\n    DoCombatBehavior();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Phase-Based Behavior Switching
    code: "void UpdateAI()\n{\n    CombatPhase phase = aiIntegrator->GetPhase();\n\
      \    switch (phase)\n    {\n        case PHASE_PRECOMBAT:\n            // Handle\
      \ pre-combat logic\n            break;\n        case PHASE_COMBAT:\n       \
      \     // Execute combat actions\n            break;\n        case PHASE_POSTCOMBAT:\n\
      \            // Clean up after combat\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles to determine
    current behavior state. The phase may change dynamically based on combat events
    such as target acquisition, health thresholds, or environmental conditions. The
    implementation should be thread-safe if accessed from multiple execution contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatAIIntegrator instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized AI component may result in
    undefined behavior. The returned phase value should not be modified directly -
    it represents a read-only state of the current combat situation.
