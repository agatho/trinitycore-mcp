documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of recent performance alerts from the bot performance monitor.
  description: The GetRecentAlerts method returns a vector containing the most recent
    performance alerts generated by the BotPerformanceMonitor. This method is typically
    used to retrieve and analyze performance issues or anomalies detected in bot behavior,
    such as high CPU usage, memory leaks, or unexpected performance drops. The returned
    alerts are ordered from newest to oldest, with the number of alerts limited by
    the specified maximum count parameter. This functionality is essential for monitoring
    and maintaining optimal performance of AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<PerformanceAlert> containing recent performance alerts. Each
    PerformanceAlert object represents a detected issue or anomaly in bot performance,
    including details such as alert type, timestamp, severity level, and associated
    bot identifier. The vector may be empty if no alerts have been recorded since
    the monitor was initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve up to 10 recent alerts
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\nstd::vector<PerformanceAlert> alerts =\
      \ monitor.GetRecentAlerts(10);\nfor (const auto& alert : alerts) {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Alert: \" << alert.GetMessage() << \" at \" << alert.GetTimestamp() <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for critical performance issues
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\nstd::vector<PerformanceAlert> alerts =\
      \ monitor.GetRecentAlerts(50);\nint criticalCount = 0;\nfor (const auto& alert\
      \ : alerts) {\n    if (alert.GetSeverity() == AlertSeverity::CRITICAL) {\n \
      \       ++criticalCount;\n    }\n}\nif (criticalCount > 0) {\n    // Handle\
      \ critical performance issues\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Detected {} critical\
      \ performance issues\", criticalCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads simultaneously
    without requiring external synchronization. The returned vector contains copies
    of the alert objects, so modifications to the returned alerts will not affect
    the internal state of the monitor. Performance of this method is optimized for
    frequent calls as it uses an internal circular buffer to store recent alerts.
  warnings: The method returns a copy of the internal alert data, which means that
    any modifications to the returned vector or its elements do not affect the original
    monitor's state. Be aware that retrieving a large number of alerts may cause performance
    overhead if the monitor has accumulated many entries over time.
