documentation:
  brief: Cancels all active shapeshift forms for the player
  description: The CancelAllShapeshifts method removes any active shapeshift form
    that the player currently has applied. This includes forms such as Cat Form, Bear
    Form, Moonkin Form, and other creature or elemental transformations. The method
    ensures that the player reverts to their normal human or humanoid form, removing
    any visual and gameplay effects associated with the shapeshift. It is typically
    called when a player needs to immediately exit a shapeshift state, such as during
    combat situations where the form is no longer beneficial, or when transitioning
    between different game states.

  - title: Cancel shapeshifts on player AI
    code: 'PlayerAI* ai = player->GetPlayerAI();

      ai->CancelAllShapeshifts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates and visual changes in
    the client to ensure that all shapeshift effects are properly removed. It may
    also reset any associated abilities or stats that were modified during the shapeshift.
