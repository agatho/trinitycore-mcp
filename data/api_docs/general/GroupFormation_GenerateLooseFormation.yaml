  class: GroupFormation
  method: GenerateLooseFormation
  signature: int GroupFormation::GenerateLooseFormation(uint32 memberCount, float
    spacing) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a loose formation for a group of units with specified spacing.
  description: The GenerateLooseFormation method calculates and assigns a loose, spread-out
    formation for a group of units within the GroupFormation class. This method is
    typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage how player characters
    or NPCs are positioned during group activities such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
    It ensures that group members maintain a certain distance from each other to avoid
    collision and improve gameplay mechanics. The formation is generated based on
    the number of members and the specified spacing parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: memberCount
    description: The total number of group members for which the formation will be
      calculated. Must be a positive integer.
  - name: spacing
    description: The minimum distance (in yards) that should be maintained between
      each group member. Should be a non-negative floating-point value.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the success status of the formation generation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values may indicate
    errors such as invalid parameters or insufficient resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nint result = formation.GenerateLooseFormation(5,\
      \ 3.0f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Formation successfully generated\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "GroupFormation formation;\nuint32 members = 8;\nfloat spacing = 2.5f;\n\
      int status = formation.GenerateLooseFormation(members, spacing);\nif (status\
      \ < 0) {\n    // Handle error case\n    std::cout << \"Failed to generate loose\
      \ formation\" << std::endl;\n} else if (status == 0) {\n    // Formation generated\
      \ successfully\n    std::cout << \"Loose formation created for \" << members\
      \ << \" members with spacing \" << spacing << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group members are already initialized and available
    for positioning. The actual implementation may vary depending on the underlying
    game state, such as terrain or object placement constraints. Performance considerations
    include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency updates.
  warnings: Ensure that memberCount is not zero or excessively large to prevent unexpected
    behavior or performance degradation. Invalid spacing values (e.g., negative numbers)
    might lead to undefined results or errors.
