  signature: void InterruptManager::HandleMythicPlusAffixes(uint8 mythicLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies Mythic+ affix effects based on the specified keystone
    level
  description: The HandleMythicPlusAffixes method manages the application of various
    affix effects that occur during Mythic+ dungeon runs. It takes a single parameter
    representing the keystone level (1-20) and determines which affixes should be
    active for that specific run. The method likely modifies player attributes, environment
    conditions, or encounter mechanics to reflect the selected affixes. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining the dynamic difficulty scaling and unique challenges
    presented by different Mythic+ levels.
  parameters:
  - name: mythicLevel
    description: The keystone level (1-20) that determines which affixes are active
      for the current Mythic+ run. Valid values range from 1 to 20, with higher levels
      typically introducing more challenging affix combinations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      interruptMgr.HandleMythicPlusAffixes(15); // Apply affixes for a 15-level keystone
      run'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Affix Application
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterMythicPlusDungeon(Player* player, uint8 level)\n{\n \
      \   InterruptManager interruptMgr;\n    interruptMgr.HandleMythicPlusAffixes(level);\n\
      \    // Additional logic for applying affix-specific effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's affix system and may trigger
    additional events or modifications to player stats, encounter difficulty, or environmental
    conditions. The implementation might cache affix data or use lookup tables for
    performance optimization.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input values between 1-20. Invalid values may
    cause undefined behavior or incorrect affix application. Ensure proper validation
    before calling this method in critical game flow logic.
