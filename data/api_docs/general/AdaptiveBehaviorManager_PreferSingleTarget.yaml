  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: PreferSingleTarget
  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::PreferSingleTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the adaptive behavior manager prefers single-target combat
    over multi-target engagement.
  description: The PreferSingleTarget method evaluates and returns a boolean value
    indicating if the current adaptive behavior configuration favors targeting a single
    enemy at a time. This is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine
    optimal combat strategies based on factors such as threat level, damage output
    potential, or encounter mechanics. The method does not modify any internal state
    but provides a read-only assessment of the manager's current preference setting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value where 'true' indicates that the adaptive behavior manager
    prefers single-target engagement, and 'false' indicates it prefers multi-target
    engagement or is neutral in its targeting preference.
  examples:
  - title: Check if AI prefers single target
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.PreferSingleTarget()) {\n    // AI will focus\
      \ on one enemy\n    DoSingleTargetAttack();\n} else {\n    // AI will consider\
      \ multiple enemies\n    DoMultiTargetAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger adaptive AI system that dynamically
    adjusts combat behavior based on environmental conditions and enemy positioning.
    It may be influenced by factors such as the number of nearby enemies, their threat
    levels, or specific encounter design requirements.
