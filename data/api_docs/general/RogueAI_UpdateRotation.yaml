  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void RogueAI::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the rogue's combat rotation based on current target and game state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate sequence of abilities for a rogue AI character during combat.
    It evaluates the current target, available energy, combo points, and other relevant
    factors to decide which abilities should be used next in the rotation. This method
    typically integrates with the rogue's decision-making logic to optimize damage
    output or utility based on the encounter context. The method modifies internal
    AI state and may trigger ability casting or movement decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier for the
      rogue's current focus. This value is used to determine which enemy to prioritize
      in the rotation logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of UpdateRotation with target
    code: 'int currentTarget = 12345;

      rogueAI->UpdateRotation(&currentTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI's update cycle and may be invoked
    repeatedly during combat. The target parameter should be a valid identifier for
    an existing unit in the game world. The method assumes that the rogue has already
    been initialized with proper combat state information.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid integer value before
    calling this method, as passing an invalid or null pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior. The method does not validate if the target is still alive or within
    range; such checks should be performed by calling code.
