documentation:
  brief: Dumps the contents of the group event queue to the console for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpEventQueue method is a diagnostic utility that outputs all
    pending events in the GroupEventBus queue to the system console or log. This method
    is typically used during development and debugging to inspect the state of event
    processing within a group context. It does not modify any internal state and serves
    purely for informational purposes. The output includes details about each queued
    event such as type, timestamp, and associated data. This method is usually disabled
    in production builds to avoid performance overhead.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'GroupEventBus eventBus;

      // ... add some events to the bus ...

      eventBus.DumpEventQueue(); // Prints all queued events to console'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for developers and debugging purposes.
    It may not be available or have any effect in release builds of TrinityCore. The
    output format depends on the implementation details of the event logging system.
  warnings: Using this method in a production environment may cause performance degradation
    due to console output operations. It should only be used during development or
    when explicitly debugging group-related events.
