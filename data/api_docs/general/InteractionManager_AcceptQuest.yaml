    uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts a quest from a quest giver for the specified player bot
  description: The AcceptQuest method facilitates the process of accepting a quest
    in World of Warcraft through the TrinityCore emulation framework. It handles the
    interaction between a player bot and a quest giver NPC to initiate a quest. The
    method requires a valid player instance, a pointer to the quest giver's identifier,
    and the unique quest ID. This function is typically used within AI scripts or
    quest automation systems where bots need to programmatically accept quests. The
    method performs validation checks on the quest giver and quest ID before attempting
    to accept the quest, ensuring that the player meets prerequisites such as level
    requirements and quest availability.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will accept
      the quest. Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest giver's identifier (typically
      a GUID or NPC entry ID). This value is modified during execution to reflect
      the actual quest giver involved in the transaction.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be accepted. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully accepted by the player bot,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, quest prerequisites
    not met, or network/session issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player instance\nint questGiver = 12345;\
      \ // NPC entry ID\nuint32 questId = 1001;\nbool success = sInteractionManager->AcceptQuest(bot,\
      \ &questGiver, questId);\nif (success) {\n    // Quest accepted successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to accept quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Acceptance with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint questGiver = 12345;\nuint32 questId = 1001;\nbool\
      \ result = sInteractionManager->AcceptQuest(bot, &questGiver, questId);\nif\
      \ (!result) {\n    // Log error or retry logic\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to accept quest %u for bot %s\", questId, bot->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot has proper access to the game world
    and that the quest giver is within interaction range. The questGiver parameter
    is modified during execution to reflect the actual quest giver involved in the
    transaction, which may be useful for logging or tracking purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest giver pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Passing invalid or null pointers can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Also, verify that the player bot has sufficient permissions and is not
    in a state that would prevent quest acceptance (e.g., dead, in combat).
