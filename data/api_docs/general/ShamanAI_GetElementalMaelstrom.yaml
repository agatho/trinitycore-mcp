documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current elemental maelstrom charge level of the shaman AI.
  description: The GetElementalMaelstrom method returns an integer value representing
    the current charge level of the elemental maelstrom ability for a shaman AI instance.
    This value typically corresponds to the number of times the shaman has cast elemental
    spells or accumulated maelstrom charges, which is used in various shaman abilities
    and talents such as Lava Burst, Earthquake, and Maelstrom Weapon. The method provides
    access to internal state tracking within the shaman's AI behavior system for managing
    elemental spellcasting mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the current elemental maelstrom charge level.
    This is typically a non-negative integer that increases with each eligible elemental
    spell cast by the shaman, up to a maximum defined by game mechanics (usually 5
    charges). A return value of 0 indicates no active maelstrom charges.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int maelstromCharges = shamanAI->GetElementalMaelstrom();\nif (maelstromCharges\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Perform action based on available maelstrom charges\n    DoSomethingWithMaelstrom(maelstromCharges);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Maelstrom Weapon Buff
    code: "int charges = shamanAI->GetElementalMaelstrom();\nif (charges >= 5)\n{\n\
      \    // Trigger Maelstrom Weapon proc or similar high-charge effect\n    DoMaelstromWeaponProc();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal AI state tracking for elemental maelstrom charges.
    The exact implementation may vary based on the specific shaman class specialization
    and active talents. The returned value should be used in conjunction with other
    shaman AI methods to determine appropriate spell casting behavior.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned value directly as it represents a read-only
    state. Changes to maelstrom charges should be handled through proper AI spell
    casting mechanisms rather than direct manipulation of this return value.
