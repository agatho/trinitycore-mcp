  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: TriggerLoadRecovery
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::TriggerLoadRecovery(uint32 targetIncrease)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a load recovery process to increase bot performance by adjusting
    resource allocation.
  description: The TriggerLoadRecovery method is designed to dynamically adjust system
    resources and performance parameters within the TrinityCore bot framework. This
    method is typically invoked when the system detects elevated load or performance
    degradation, allowing for automatic recovery mechanisms to be triggered. It accepts
    a target increase parameter that defines how much the system should scale up its
    resource allocation to improve bot responsiveness and overall server performance.
    The method operates at the core level of the bot management system and may involve
    adjustments to memory usage, CPU scheduling, or other performance-related metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: targetIncrease
    description: Specifies the desired percentage increase in resource allocation
      for load recovery. Valid values are typically between 10-100, representing the
      proportional boost to system resources such as memory or processing power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Load Recovery Trigger
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = BotPerformanceMonitor::GetInstance();

      monitor->TriggerLoadRecovery(50); // Increase resources by 50%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Load Recovery Based on Server Metrics
    code: "if (serverLoad > HIGH_LOAD_THRESHOLD) {\n    BotPerformanceMonitor* monitor\
      \ = BotPerformanceMonitor::GetInstance();\n    monitor->TriggerLoadRecovery(75);\
      \ // Aggressive recovery for high load\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active bot management operations.
    It may cause temporary performance fluctuations as resources are reallocated.
    The targetIncrease parameter is clamped to valid ranges to prevent system instability.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper load monitoring can
    lead to resource exhaustion or system instability. Ensure that the targetIncrease
    value is appropriate for current server conditions to avoid over-allocation.
