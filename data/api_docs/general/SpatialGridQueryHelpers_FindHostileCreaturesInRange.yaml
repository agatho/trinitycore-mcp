  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindHostileCreaturesInRange
  signature: int SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindHostileCreaturesInRange(Player * bot,
    float range, bool requireAlive)
documentation:
  brief: Finds hostile creatures within a specified range of the player.
  description: The FindHostileCreaturesInRange method searches for all hostile creatures
    located within a given range from the specified player. It is commonly used in
    AI logic to identify nearby threats or targets for combat actions. The method
    can optionally filter results to only include alive creatures. This function leverages
    the spatial grid system to efficiently query nearby objects without iterating
    through the entire world object list.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which to search for hostile creatures.
      Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which to search for hostile creatures.
      Must be a positive value.
  - name: requireAlive
    description: If true, only returns creatures that are currently alive. If false,
      includes dead creatures as well.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of hostile creatures found within
    the specified range. Returns zero if no hostile creatures are found or if the
    input parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find all nearby hostile creatures
    code: int count = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindHostileCreaturesInRange(player,
      30.0f, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Find hostile creatures with dead ones included
    code: int count = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindHostileCreaturesInRange(player,
      25.0f, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the TrinityCore's spatial grid system for optimized performance
    when searching large numbers of objects. It is recommended to use reasonable range
    values to avoid excessive processing overhead. The function does not modify the
    state of any creatures or the player object.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is a valid pointer to prevent crashes.
    Using excessively large ranges may impact performance due to increased query size.
    The method assumes that the player's current location and orientation are correctly
    set in the world.
