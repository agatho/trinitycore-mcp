  class: MovementPriorityMapper
  method: IsValidPriority
  signature: bool MovementPriorityMapper::IsValidPriority(uint8 value)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a given movement priority value is within the acceptable
    range for use in TrinityCore's movement system.
  description: The IsValidPriority method checks if a provided uint8 value represents
    a valid movement priority level within the TrinityCore framework. Movement priorities
    are used to determine the order and handling of various movement-related actions,
    such as pathfinding, waypoint following, or unit movement adjustments. This validation
    ensures that only recognized priority levels are accepted, preventing invalid
    or unexpected behavior in the game's movement mechanics. The method typically
    operates on predefined constants or ranges that correspond to different movement
    behaviors like idle, walk, run, or emergency movement states.
  parameters:
  - name: value
    description: The uint8 movement priority value to validate. This should represent
      a valid priority level used internally by the movement system, typically ranging
      from 0 to a maximum defined constant within the framework.
  returns: Returns true if the provided value corresponds to a valid movement priority
    level; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "MovementPriorityMapper mapper;\nuint8 priority = 2;\nif (mapper.IsValidPriority(priority))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with movement logic using this priority\n}\nelse {\n   \
      \ // Handle invalid priority value\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in movement command validation
    code: "void HandleSetMovementPriority(WorldSession* session, uint8 newPriority)\
      \ {\n    MovementPriorityMapper mapper;\n    if (!mapper.IsValidPriority(newPriority))\
      \ {\n        SendErrorMessage(session, \"Invalid movement priority specified.\"\
      );\n        return;\n    }\n    // Apply the valid priority to unit's movement\
      \ behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple range check against predefined constants
    or an internal lookup table. It is designed to be fast and lightweight, as it
    may be called frequently during movement processing. The exact valid range of
    priority values should align with the MovementPriority enum or constant definitions
    in TrinityCore's movement system.
  warnings: Ensure that the input value is properly sanitized before calling this
    method, as invalid values could lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely a validation check.
