  class: LFGMgr
  method: AllQueued
  signature: bool LFGMgr::AllQueued(const int & check)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if all players in a group are queued for LFG.
  description: The AllQueued method determines whether all members of a player's group
    are currently queued for Looking For Group (LFG) activity. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to validate group readiness for dungeon
    or raid matching. It evaluates the LFG status of each group member and returns
    true only if every player in the group has an active LFG queue. The check parameter
    likely represents a specific queue type or group identifier, though its exact
    meaning requires further context from the internal implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: check
    description: An integer identifier used to specify which LFG queue or group type
      to validate. The value may represent a dungeon ID, instance type, or other queue-specific
      criteria.
  returns: Returns true if all players in the current player's group are queued for
    the specified LFG activity; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if all group members are queued for a specific dungeon
    code: "if (sLFGMgr->AllQueued(1234)) {\n    // All group members are queued for\
      \ dungeon with ID 1234\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LFG_QUEUE_ALL_QUEUED);\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Not all members are queued\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LFG_QUEUE_NOT_ALL_QUEUED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during group formation and LFG matching processes.
    It relies on internal LFG queue tracking systems and may have performance implications
    when called frequently during active LFG operations.
  warnings: The behavior of this method depends heavily on the current state of the
    LFG system and group membership. Calling it outside of proper group contexts may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect results.
