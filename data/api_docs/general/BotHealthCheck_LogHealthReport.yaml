  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: LogHealthReport
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::LogHealthReport() const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a detailed health report for all active bot instances in the TrinityCore
    server environment.
  description: The LogHealthReport method generates and outputs a comprehensive health
    status summary for all currently active bot characters within the World of Warcraft
    server. This function is typically invoked during server maintenance, debugging
    sessions, or automated monitoring processes to assess the operational state of
    bot systems. The method collects data such as bot health points, mana levels,
    combat readiness, and other relevant metrics before writing this information to
    the server's log files. It serves as a diagnostic tool for administrators and
    developers to monitor bot performance and identify potential issues in real-time
    or post-incident analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Maintenance Script
    code: "void PerformBotHealthCheck() {\n    BotHealthCheck healthChecker;\n   \
      \ healthChecker.LogHealthReport();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Automated Monitoring System
    code: "class BotMonitor {\npublic:\n    void CheckAllBots() {\n        BotHealthCheck\
      \ checker;\n        checker.LogHealthReport();\n        // Additional monitoring\
      \ logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from the main server thread and may
    block briefly during log generation. It does not modify any bot states or data;
    it only reads current values for logging purposes. The output format in logs follows
    standard TrinityCore logging conventions.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently during high-traffic periods might impact
    server performance due to log file I/O operations. Ensure sufficient disk space
    is available for log files, especially when running multiple bots simultaneously.
