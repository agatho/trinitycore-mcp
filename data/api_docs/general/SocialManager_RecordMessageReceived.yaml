documentation:
  brief: Records a message receipt event for the player's social interactions.
  description: The RecordMessageReceived method is used to log or track when a chat
    message of a specific type has been received by the player. This functionality
    is typically part of the social system within TrinityCore, which manages player
    interactions such as whispers, guild chat, officer chat, and other communication
    channels. The method updates internal tracking mechanisms to ensure proper handling
    of message delivery and synchronization across the game world. It does not directly
    process or modify the received message but rather serves as a notification mechanism
    for the social manager.

  - title: Basic Usage in Social Manager Context
    code: "void SomeHandlerFunction()\n{\n    // Simulate receiving a whisper\n  \
      \  sSocialMgr->RecordMessageReceived(CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked internally by the core chat system when a message
    is successfully delivered to a player. It may be used for anti-spam mechanisms,
    logging purposes, or updating UI elements related to social interaction.
