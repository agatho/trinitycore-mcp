api:
  class: TankPositioning
  method: IsInSwapPosition
  signature: bool TankPositioning::IsInSwapPosition(Player * tank, Player * otherTank,
    Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified tank is in an appropriate position for swapping
    with another tank.
  description: The IsInSwapPosition method evaluates if a given player (tank) is positioned
    correctly relative to a target unit and another tank, typically used during group
    encounters or boss fights where tank swapping mechanics are implemented. This
    method likely checks positional proximity, orientation, and possibly line-of-sight
    conditions to ensure that a safe and effective tank swap can occur. The functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper combat dynamics in group content such as raid
    encounters or complex dungeon scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: tank
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the current tank that is
      being evaluated for swap eligibility.
  - name: otherTank
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the alternate tank that
      may be swapped with the primary tank.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit (e.g., boss
      or mob) that both tanks are engaging.
  returns: Returns true if all positional conditions for a tank swap are met, otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the tank is in a valid location to perform
    or accept a swap with another tank.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a tank swap check
    code: "if (tankPositioning->IsInSwapPosition(playerTank, otherTank, bossTarget))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with tank swap logic\n    playerTank->SwapTanks(otherTank);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a combat encounter loop
    code: "void CheckTankSwap(Player* tank1, Player* tank2, Unit* target) {\n    if\
      \ (tankPositioning->IsInSwapPosition(tank1, tank2, target)) {\n        // Perform\
      \ swap actions\n        tank1->SetInCombatWith(tank2);\n        tank2->SetInCombatWith(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger tank management system and may rely
    on internal positioning data such as distance, facing direction, and target engagement
    status. It's recommended to verify that both players are within acceptable proximity
    before invoking this check.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player and Unit pointers are valid and not null;
    otherwise, calling this method could result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that this function may have performance implications if called
    frequently during high-intensity combat scenarios.
