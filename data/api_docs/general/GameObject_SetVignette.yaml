  class: GameObject
  method: SetVignette
  signature: void GameObject::SetVignette(uint32 vignetteId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the vignette ID for the GameObject, determining its visual representation
    in the game world.
  description: This method assigns a specific vignette ID to the GameObject, which
    controls how the object appears visually within the World of Warcraft client.
    The vignette ID determines the visual effects and appearance of the GameObject,
    including its display in the game world. This method is typically used during
    object creation or modification to ensure proper visual representation. The method
    does not return any value and operates on the GameObject's internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: vignetteId
    description: The unique identifier that defines the visual appearance of the GameObject.
      This ID corresponds to a specific vignette in the game's database, determining
      how the object will be displayed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Vignette ID for a GameObject
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetVignette(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called during object initialization or when modifying
    the visual representation of an object. It may affect performance if used frequently
    in loops, as it updates internal state variables.
  warnings: This method should not be used on objects that are already spawned in
    the world without proper synchronization to avoid visual inconsistencies or client-side
    errors.
