  class: Battleground
  method: GetPlayerScoresSize
  signature: int Battleground::GetPlayerScoresSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of player scores currently stored in the battleground.
  description: The GetPlayerScoresSize method retrieves the count of player score
    records associated with the battleground instance. This value typically corresponds
    to the number of players who have participated in the battleground and whose scores
    are being tracked. The method is commonly used for iterating through player scores,
    validating score data integrity, or determining the size of internal collections
    related to player performance during the match. It does not modify any state and
    provides a read-only view of the current score collection size.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of player score entries currently stored
    in the battleground's score tracking system. Returns zero if no players have been
    scored or if the battleground has not yet initialized its score data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Player Score Count
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    int scoreCount = bg->GetPlayerScoresSize();\n    printf(\"Number of player\
      \ scores: %d\\n\", scoreCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the battleground system to manage
    and iterate over player score data. It's important to note that the returned value
    may change during a battleground's lifecycle as players join or leave, though
    in most cases it reflects the final count after the match ends.
