documentation:
  brief: Initiates character login process for all active bot sessions in the system.
  description: The TriggerCharacterLoginForAllSessions method is responsible for triggering
    the character login sequence across all currently active bot sessions managed
    by the BotSessionMgr. This method ensures that each bot session attempts to establish
    a valid character connection to the game server, typically invoked during system
    initialization or when reconnecting after a network disruption. The method does
    not return any value and operates on the internal collection of bot sessions,
    iterating through them to initiate their login procedures. It is commonly used
    in scenarios where bot accounts need to be reauthenticated or when the system
    requires all bots to synchronize their connection states with the server.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotSessionMgr* sessionManager = BotSessionMgr::Instance();

      sessionManager->TriggerCharacterLoginForAllSessions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all bot sessions are properly initialized and configured
    before invocation. It may cause performance overhead if a large number of bot
    sessions exist, as each session's login process is executed sequentially. The
    method does not handle individual session failures or provide feedback on the
    success status of each login attempt.
  warnings: Invoking this method while bots are already logged in might result in
    unexpected behavior or connection issues. Ensure that all existing sessions are
    properly closed or reset before calling this function to avoid conflicts with
    active connections.
