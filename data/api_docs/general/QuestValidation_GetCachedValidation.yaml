  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetCachedValidation
  signature: ValidationResult QuestValidation::GetCachedValidation(uint32 questId,
    uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves cached quest validation results for a specific quest and bot GUID.
  description: The GetCachedValidation method fetches precomputed validation data
    for a given quest ID and bot GUID from an internal cache. This method is used
    to avoid recomputing validation logic repeatedly for the same quest-bot combination,
    improving performance in scenarios where quests are validated multiple times.
    The cached results typically include information about whether the quest can be
    accepted, completed, or if there are any restrictions based on the bot's state
    or progress. This caching mechanism is particularly useful in automated questing
    systems or botting frameworks within TrinityCore-based servers.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate. Must be a valid quest
      entry from the database.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the bot instance performing the validation.
      Used to distinguish between different bots and their individual quest states.
  returns: A ValidationResult object containing the cached validation result for the
    specified quest and bot GUID. The result includes flags indicating if the quest
    is valid, can be accepted, completed, or has any restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "QuestValidation validation;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nuint32 botGuid =\
      \ 67890;\nValidationResult result = validation.GetCachedValidation(questId,\
      \ botGuid);\nif (result.IsValid()) {\n    // Proceed with quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Quest Acceptance
    code: "QuestValidation validation;\nuint32 questId = 12345;\nuint32 botGuid =\
      \ 67890;\nValidationResult result = validation.GetCachedValidation(questId,\
      \ botGuid);\nif (result.CanBeAccepted()) {\n    // Logic to accept the quest\n\
      } else if (result.IsCompleted()) {\n    // Logic to turn in the quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that validation data has already been computed and cached
    previously. If no cache entry exists for the given parameters, behavior may vary
    depending on implementation - it could return a default invalid result or trigger
    a new computation. The cache is likely thread-safe but should be used with caution
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Ensure that quest IDs and bot GUIDs are valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. Cache invalidation must be handled properly when
    quest data changes to prevent stale results from being returned.
