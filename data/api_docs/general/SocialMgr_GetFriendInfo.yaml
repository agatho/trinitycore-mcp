  class: SocialMgr
  method: GetFriendInfo
  signature: void SocialMgr::GetFriendInfo(Player * player, const int & friendGUID,
    FriendInfo & friendInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves detailed information about a specific friend from a player's social
    list.
  description: The GetFriendInfo method fetches comprehensive details about a specified
    friend of a given player, including their online status, relationship type, and
    other relevant social data. This method is typically used by the game's social
    system to display friend information in the user interface or to perform operations
    based on friend status. It requires a valid player object and a valid friend GUID
    to retrieve accurate information. The retrieved FriendInfo structure contains
    fields such as online status, friendship type, and notes associated with the friend.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose social list contains the friend.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: friendGUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the friend whose information is being
      retrieved. This should correspond to a valid player or creature GUID present
      in the player's social list.
  - name: friendInfo
    description: Reference to a FriendInfo structure where the retrieved friend details
      will be stored. The structure will be populated with data from the social manager
      based on the provided friendGUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Friend Information
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nint friendGUID = 12345;\n\
      FriendInfo info;\nSocialMgr::GetFriendInfo(player, friendGUID, info);\n// info\
      \ now contains the friend's details\nif (info.online)\n{\n    // Handle online\
      \ friend case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Friend Status Before Retrieval
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nint friendGUID = 12345;\n\
      FriendInfo info;\nif (player->GetSocial()->HasFriend(friendGUID))\n{\n    SocialMgr::GetFriendInfo(player,\
      \ friendGUID, info);\n    // Process friend info\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid friend GUID case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the social management system in TrinityCore and relies
    on internal data structures representing player relationships. It assumes that
    the provided player object has a valid social list and that the friendGUID exists
    within that list. The FriendInfo structure should be properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid potential memory issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer or a non-existent friend
    GUID may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs before
    invoking this method. Additionally, ensure that the player object is fully initialized
    and not in a transitional state (e.g., during login/logout processes).
