  method: HandleEventChanges
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::HandleEventChanges(int * player, uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies changes to guild events for a specified player.
  description: The HandleEventChanges method is responsible for managing updates and
    modifications to guild-related events for a given player. It processes event data,
    validates changes, and ensures that the guild's event system remains consistent
    with the player's current state or actions. This method typically handles synchronization
    between client-side event modifications and server-side event tracking, ensuring
    that all players in the guild are properly notified of any updates. The method
    operates on a per-player basis, using the provided player identifier to determine
    which events need updating.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) within the guild system. This value is used to locate and process specific
      event changes for that player.
  - name: eventId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific guild event that
      requires processing or modification. This ID corresponds to a registered event
      in the guild's event coordinator system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      uint32 eventId = 67890;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.HandleEventChanges(&playerId, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Events
    code: "int playerIds[] = {12345, 12346, 12347};\nuint32 eventIds[] = {67890, 67891,\
      \ 67892};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;\n\
      \    coordinator.HandleEventChanges(&playerIds[i], eventIds[i]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and event identifiers are valid and exist
    within the guild system. It may perform internal validation or error handling
    if invalid data is encountered. The method should be called only when there are
    actual changes to process, as unnecessary calls could impact performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the eventId corresponds to an existing event in the guild's event coordinator
    system to avoid processing non-existent events.
