  class: InterruptManager
  method: ScanForInterruptTargets
  signature: int InterruptManager::ScanForInterruptTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Scans for potential interrupt targets within the current encounter or combat
    state.
  description: The ScanForInterruptTargets method evaluates the current combat environment
    to identify and return a count of valid targets that can be interrupted. This
    typically occurs during spell casting or channeling when an interruptible action
    is in progress. The method iterates through nearby hostile units, checking for
    conditions such as ongoing cast times, specific spell effects, or other interruptible
    states. It serves as a core component in managing combat flow and ensuring proper
    handling of interrupt mechanics within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid interrupt targets found
    during the scan. A value of zero indicates no suitable targets were detected,
    while positive values indicate the count of interruptible entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat handler
    code: "int targetCount = interruptManager.ScanForInterruptTargets();\nif (targetCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interrupt logic\n    DoInterruptAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to determine interrupt eligibility
    code: "int interruptTargets = interruptManager.ScanForInterruptTargets();\nif\
      \ (interruptTargets > 0)\n{\n    // Set interrupt flag for current spell\n \
      \   currentSpell->SetInterruptible(true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Continue casting\n\
      \    currentSpell->ContinueCasting();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell update cycles or when interrupt
    conditions are checked. It relies on internal target validation logic that considers
    distance, line of sight, and combat state. Performance may vary depending on the
    number of nearby units and their active spell states.
  warnings: The method assumes valid combat context; calling it outside of an active
    encounter may produce unexpected results. Ensure proper initialization of the
    InterruptManager before usage to avoid undefined behavior.
