  brief: Initializes possess create spells for a charm
  description: The InitPossessCreateSpells method sets up the spell creation abilities
    for a possessed creature or unit. This method is typically called during the initialization
    of a charm's spell system to ensure that possess spells are properly configured
    and available for use. It handles the setup of spell-related data structures and
    ensures that the charm can utilize possess-based abilities as defined by the game
    mechanics.

    code: "CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();\nif (charmInfo)\n{\n   \
      \ charmInfo->InitPossessCreateSpells();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the CharmInfo object has been properly
    initialized and associated with a valid creature or unit. It is typically invoked
    internally by the TrinityCore framework during the charm creation process.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized CharmInfo object may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the CharmInfo instance is fully constructed
    before invoking this method.
