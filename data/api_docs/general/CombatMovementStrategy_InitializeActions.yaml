documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat movement actions for the AI strategy.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and configures all necessary movement
    behaviors and action priorities for a combat-focused AI strategy. This method
    is typically called during the initialization phase of an AI controller to establish
    the default set of actions that the creature or NPC will use when engaged in combat.
    It defines how the AI will approach, retreat, or maintain positioning relative
    to its target based on combat mechanics and predefined movement patterns.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'CombatMovementStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeActions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's initialization phase.
    Subsequent calls may result in undefined behavior or redundant setup operations.
    The method relies on internal state management and assumes that the AI context
    has been properly configured with valid target information.
