  class: BotScheduler
  method: GetTimeMultiplier
  signature: float BotScheduler::GetTimeMultiplier(int time, const ActivityPattern
    & pattern) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a time multiplier based on the provided time and activity
    pattern for bot scheduling.
  description: The GetTimeMultiplier method computes a floating-point value that represents
    a scaling factor for time-based activities within the bot scheduler. This multiplier
    is derived from the input time and an activity pattern, which likely defines when
    certain behaviors should be more or less frequent. The method is used internally
    by the BotScheduler to adjust timing logic according to configured schedules or
    patterns, such as varying bot activity levels during different hours of the day
    or specific game events. It ensures that bots behave appropriately in relation
    to time-sensitive game mechanics and player availability.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: An integer representing the current time in a standardized format
      (e.g., minutes since midnight or Unix timestamp). Used as input to determine
      the appropriate multiplier based on activity patterns.
  - name: pattern
    description: A constant reference to an ActivityPattern object that defines how
      activities should vary over time. This typically includes time ranges and associated
      multipliers for different periods (e.g., peak hours vs off-peak).
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated time multiplier. A value
    greater than 1.0 increases activity duration or frequency, while a value less
    than 1.0 decreases it. A value of 1.0 indicates no adjustment to normal timing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int currentTime = 14 * 60 + 30; // 2:30 PM in minutes

      ActivityPattern pattern;

      // Assume pattern is initialized with time ranges and multipliers

      float multiplier = scheduler.GetTimeMultiplier(currentTime, pattern);

      // multiplier will be used to adjust bot behavior timing'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Pattern
    code: '#include <chrono>

      using namespace std::chrono;

      auto now = system_clock::now();

      int minutesSinceMidnight = duration_cast<minutes>(now.time_since_epoch()).count()
      % (24 * 60);

      ActivityPattern dynamicPattern;

      dynamicPattern.AddTimeRange(0, 600, 0.5f);   // Low activity during early morning

      dynamicPattern.AddTimeRange(600, 1200, 1.5f); // High activity in afternoon

      float result = scheduler.GetTimeMultiplier(minutesSinceMidnight, dynamicPattern);

      // Adjusts bot behavior based on current time of day'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is const and does not modify internal state. It assumes that the
    ActivityPattern has been properly initialized with valid time ranges and multipliers.
    The time parameter should be normalized to a consistent unit (e.g., minutes since
    midnight) for accurate pattern matching.
  warnings: Ensure that the ActivityPattern passed into this method contains valid
    time range definitions, otherwise unexpected multiplier values may occur. Be cautious
    when using large time values or negative numbers as they might not map correctly
    to defined patterns.
