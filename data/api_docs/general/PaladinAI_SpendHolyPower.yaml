  method: SpendHolyPower
  signature: void PaladinAI::SpendHolyPower(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Spends available Holy Power to cast a spell or ability.
  description: The SpendHolyPower method is responsible for consuming the Paladin's
    current Holy Power resource to execute a specific spell or ability. This method
    typically checks if sufficient Holy Power is available and then deducts the required
    amount to perform the action. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this
    method is part of the PaladinAI class which governs the behavior of paladin NPCs
    or player-controlled paladins in combat situations. The method ensures proper
    resource management and spell execution according to the paladin's class mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      for the spell being cast using Holy Power. This parameter is used to determine
      which entity the paladin's Holy Power-based ability should be directed at.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Paladin AI
    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (HasHolyPower())\n   \
      \ {\n        int target = GetTargetGuid();\n        SpendHolyPower(&target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system during combat
    updates. It assumes that the paladin has sufficient Holy Power available and handles
    the resource deduction automatically. The target parameter should be validated
    before calling this method to prevent invalid targets.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking for available Holy Power may lead
    to incorrect behavior or errors in spell execution. Ensure proper validation of
    the target parameter to avoid undefined behavior.
