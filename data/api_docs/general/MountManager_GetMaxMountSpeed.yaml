  signature: MountSpeed MountManager::GetMaxMountSpeed(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum mount speed available to the player.
  description: The GetMaxMountSpeed method retrieves the highest possible speed at
    which a player can ride a mount in World of Warcraft. This value is determined
    by the player's current level, available mounts, and any applicable buffs or debuffs.
    The returned MountSpeed enum represents the base movement speed multiplier for
    mounted characters. This method does not consider temporary effects such as food
    buffs or potion effects that might increase mount speed beyond the base maximum.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MountSpeed enumeration value representing the maximum mount speed multiplier.
    Possible values typically include MS_NORMAL, MS_FAST, and MS_VERY_FAST depending
    on player level and available mounts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MountSpeed maxSpeed = mountManager->GetMaxMountSpeed();\nif (maxSpeed ==\
      \ MS_FAST) {\n    // Player can ride at fast mount speed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Mount Speed Against Player Level
    code: "int playerLevel = player->GetLevel();\nMountSpeed maxSpeed = mountManager->GetMaxMountSpeed();\n\
      if (playerLevel >= 70 && maxSpeed == MS_FAST) {\n    // Player at level 70 or\
      \ higher with fast mount speed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the base maximum mount speed and does not account for
    temporary modifiers such as consumables, talents, or achievements that may further
    increase mount speed. The MountSpeed enum values are typically defined in the
    TrinityCore codebase and correspond to specific movement multipliers used internally
    by the game engine.
  warnings: The returned value represents only the base maximum mount speed. Actual
    mount speed in-game may be higher due to temporary buffs or effects. Ensure proper
    handling of different MountSpeed values when implementing logic that depends on
    mount performance.
