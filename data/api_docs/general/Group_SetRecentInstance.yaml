  class: Group
  method: SetRecentInstance
  signature: void Group::SetRecentInstance(int mapId, int instanceOwner, int instanceId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the recent instance data for the group including map ID, instance owner,
    and instance identifier.
  description: The SetRecentInstance method updates the group's tracking of the most
    recently visited instance. This information is used by the game engine to manage
    instance-related mechanics such as instance locking, respawn timers, and player
    linking. The method stores the map ID, the instance owner (typically a player
    GUID or 0 for world instances), and the unique instance identifier. This data
    is crucial for maintaining proper group synchronization when players enter or
    leave instances. The method does not validate the provided parameters, so callers
    should ensure that the values are valid before invoking this function.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The ID of the map (instance) that was recently visited. Must be a
      valid map identifier from the game's map database.
  - name: instanceOwner
    description: The GUID of the player or entity that owns the instance, or 0 if
      the instance is not owned by a specific player.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The unique identifier for this specific instance. This value should
      be unique per instance and is used to distinguish between multiple instances
      of the same map.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set recent instance for a group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetRecentInstance(1234,\
      \ player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), 5678);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting recent instance with zero owner
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    // Setting a world\
      \ instance with no specific owner\n    group->SetRecentInstance(1001, 0, 9999);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal group state and should only be called
    when the group's instance tracking needs to be updated. It does not perform any
    network synchronization or send updates to clients; other systems must handle
    that separately.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    values may lead to unexpected behavior in instance-related systems. The method
    does not validate input and assumes correct usage by the caller.
