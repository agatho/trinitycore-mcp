  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: SpawnBotInZone
  signature: bool BotSpawnerOptimized::SpawnBotInZone(uint32 zoneId, uint32 mapId,
    uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns a bot within the specified zone and map with the given level.
  description: The SpawnBotInZone method is responsible for creating a new bot instance
    within a defined game zone and map. It takes a zone identifier, map identifier,
    and desired bot level as inputs to determine where and how the bot should be spawned.
    This method is typically used in automated bot systems or testing environments
    where dynamic creation of NPCs or player-controlled entities is required. The
    method returns true if the bot was successfully created and added to the game
    world, or false if the spawning process failed due to invalid parameters or system
    limitations.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where the bot should be spawned.
      This corresponds to the ZoneID field in the game's zone database.
  - name: mapId
    description: The map identifier specifying the game map where the bot will appear.
      Must correspond to a valid map entry in the game's map database.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot to be spawned. This determines the bot's stats
      and abilities, typically ranging from 1 to maximum player level in the game.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully spawned within the specified zone
    and map at the given level; otherwise returns false if spawning failed due to
    invalid parameters or system constraints.

    code: "if (botSpawner->SpawnBotInZone(1337, 0, 60)) {\n    // Bot successfully\
      \ spawned\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot spawned in Elwynn Forest (zone 1337) at\
      \ level 60\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to spawn bot\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to spawn bot in zone 1337\");\n}"

  - title: Conditional Bot Spawning Based on Zone
    code: "uint32 currentZone = player->GetZoneId();\nuint32 currentMap = player->GetMapId();\n\
      uint32 botLevel = player->getLevel();\n\nif (currentZone != 0 && currentMap\
      \ != 0) {\n    if (botSpawner->SpawnBotInZone(currentZone, currentMap, botLevel))\
      \ {\n        sLog->outString(\"Bot successfully spawned in current zone at player's\
      \ level.\");\n    } else {\n        sLog->outError(\"Failed to spawn bot in\
      \ current zone.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore bot system and assumes that the necessary
    bot configurations are already loaded. The method may perform internal checks
    for valid zone/map combinations and level ranges. It is recommended to validate
    parameters before calling this method to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid zoneId or mapId values can result in
    undefined behavior or failed spawns. Ensure that the provided level does not exceed
    the maximum allowed bot level for your server configuration. Repeated calls without
    proper cleanup may lead to resource exhaustion.
