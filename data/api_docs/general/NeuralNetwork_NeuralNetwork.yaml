documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NeuralNetwork class for AI-driven decision
    making in game entities.
  description: The NeuralNetwork constructor initializes a new neural network instance
    used by game entities to make intelligent decisions based on environmental inputs
    and learned behaviors. This implementation is typically used within AI systems
    to enable non-player characters (NPCs) or creatures to exhibit more sophisticated
    behavior patterns, such as pathfinding, combat tactics, or interaction responses.
    The constructor sets up the basic structure of the neural network including layer
    configurations, weight initialization, and activation functions necessary for
    processing game state data into actionable decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Neural Network Initialization
    code: "class CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    NeuralNetwork* aiNetwork;\n    \n   \
      \ void Initialize()\n    {\n        aiNetwork = new NeuralNetwork();\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object initialization or when
    a new AI instance is required. The neural network will not be functional until
    training data has been provided and the network has been properly configured with
    input/output layers.
  warnings: Calling this constructor without proper memory management may lead to
    memory leaks. Ensure that NeuralNetwork instances are properly destroyed using
    the destructor when no longer needed.
