documentation:
  brief: Loads immunities for a creature based on a template ID
  description: This method initializes the immunity state of a Creature object by
    loading predefined immunities from the database using the provided template ID.
    It is typically called during creature creation or loading to ensure that the
    creature has the correct set of damage and spell immunities as defined in the
    creature_template table. The method retrieves immunity data associated with the
    given creatureImmunitiesId parameter and applies it to the current creature instance,
    affecting how the creature responds to various harmful effects in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureImmunitiesId
    description: The unique identifier referencing a specific immunity template in
      the database. This ID corresponds to entries in the creature_template table's
      immunity field which defines what types of damage and spells the creature is
      immune to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading immunities for a creature during spawn
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->LoadTemplateImmunities(12345);

      // The creature now has immunities defined in template with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within a custom creature AI module
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnSpawn()\n{\n    if (m_creature->GetEntry() == 12345)\n\
      \    {\n        m_creature->LoadTemplateImmunities(9876);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the creature's internal immunity state and
    should only be called once during creature initialization. The immunities loaded
    are typically permanent for the lifetime of the creature instance unless overridden
    by dynamic changes.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same creature instance may result
    in undefined behavior or duplicate immunity entries. Ensure that the provided
    creatureImmunitiesId corresponds to a valid entry in the database, otherwise the
    creature might not have proper immunity definitions.
