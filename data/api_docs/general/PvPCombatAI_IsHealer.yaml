  signature: bool PvPCombatAI::IsHealer(int * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI-controlled unit is classified as a healer in PvP
    combat.
  description: The IsHealer method checks if the current AI unit is designated as
    a healer within the context of PvP (Player versus Player) combat. This classification
    typically affects behavior such as target selection, spell casting priorities,
    and overall tactical approach during battleground or arena encounters. The method
    evaluates internal AI state and possibly class-specific roles to determine if
    the unit should prioritize healing over other combat actions. It is commonly used
    by AI systems to dynamically adjust behavior based on role assignment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI unit is classified as a healer; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether the unit's current role in PvP combat is focused
    on healing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (pvpAI->IsHealer()) {\n    // Unit is a healer, prioritize healing spells\n\
      \    DoHealSpell();\n} else {\n    // Unit is not a healer, focus on damage\
      \ or support\n    DoDamageSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal AI state tracking and may be influenced
    by the unit's class, specialization, or role assignment during PvP encounters.
    It is intended for use within the AI decision-making loop and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI instance is properly initialized before calling this
    method, as accessing uninitialized state could lead to undefined behavior. The
    method assumes the unit has been assigned a valid PvP role; otherwise results
    may be unreliable.
