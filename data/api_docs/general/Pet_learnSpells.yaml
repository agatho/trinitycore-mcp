documentation:
  brief: Teaches specified spells to the pet.
  description: The learnSpells method adds a list of spells to the pet's spell book,
    making them available for use. This method is typically used when a pet gains
    new abilities through leveling up, quest rewards, or other game mechanics. The
    spell IDs provided must correspond to valid spells in the game's database. This
    operation modifies the pet's current spell set and may trigger updates to the
    pet's UI display and behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: spellIds
    description: An integer reference containing a list of spell identifiers to be
      learned by the pet. These IDs must correspond to valid spells in the TrinityCore
      database.

    code: 'Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();

      int spellList[] = {12345, 12346, 12347};

      myPet->learnSpells(spellList);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided spell IDs are valid and exist in the
    game's spell database. It does not perform validation on the spell IDs themselves,
    so invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors during runtime.
  warnings: Using invalid spell IDs can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Ensure
    all spell IDs passed to this method are verified against the game's spell database
    before calling.
