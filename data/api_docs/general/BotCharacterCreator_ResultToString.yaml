  class: BotCharacterCreator
  method: ResultToString
  signature: const char * BotCharacterCreator::ResultToString(CreateResult result)
documentation:
  brief: Converts a character creation result enum into a human-readable string representation.
  description: The ResultToString method takes a CreateResult enumeration value and
    returns a constant character pointer to a descriptive string that represents the
    outcome of a character creation operation. This utility function is commonly used
    in bot systems or automated character management within TrinityCore to provide
    meaningful feedback about the success or failure of character creation attempts.
    The returned string is static and should not be modified or freed by the caller.
    This method does not perform any validation on the input parameter, so passing
    an invalid CreateResult value may result in undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant character pointer to a null-terminated string describing the
    creation result. Possible return values include strings like "Success", "AlreadyExists",
    "InvalidName", "ServerLimitReached", or "UnknownError" depending on the specific
    CreateResult value passed in.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotCharacterCreator creator;

      CreateResult result = creator.CreateCharacter("TestBot", CLASS_WARRIOR, RACE_HUMAN);

      const char* message = BotCharacterCreator::ResultToString(result);

      printf("Character creation result: %s\n", message);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling with String Output
    code: "CreateResult result = botCreator.CreateCharacter(\"BadBotName\", CLASS_MAGE,\
      \ RACE_ORC);\nconst char* description = BotCharacterCreator::ResultToString(result);\n\
      if (strcmp(description, \"Success\") != 0) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Character\
      \ creation failed: %s\", description);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is managed internally by the method and is valid only
    until the next call to ResultToString or until program termination. This function
    is typically used for logging, UI display, or debugging purposes where a human-readable
    representation of the creation result is needed. The implementation assumes that
    CreateResult values are properly defined within the scope of the BotCharacterCreator
    class.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned string pointer as it points
    to static memory. Passing an invalid CreateResult value (outside the expected
    enum range) may cause undefined behavior or return unexpected strings. This method
    is not thread-safe if the underlying implementation uses static buffers.
