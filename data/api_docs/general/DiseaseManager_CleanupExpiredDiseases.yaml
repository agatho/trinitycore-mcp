documentation:
  brief: Removes all expired disease effects from active targets in the game world
  description: The CleanupExpiredDiseases method iterates through all active disease
    effects applied to players and creatures within the game world, identifying and
    removing those that have exceeded their duration. This method is typically invoked
    during periodic cleanup routines to maintain accurate state tracking of afflictions.
    It ensures that expired diseases do not persist in the system, preventing potential
    issues with stacking, healing, or combat calculations. The method operates on
    the disease manager's internal registry of active afflictions and performs necessary
    cleanup operations without requiring external input.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    diseaseManager.CleanupExpiredDiseases();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called periodically as part of the game's main
    update loop or during specific cleanup phases. It internally manages the iteration
    and removal process, so external code should not attempt to manually modify the
    disease registry during execution. The method may have performance implications
    if a large number of diseases are active simultaneously.
