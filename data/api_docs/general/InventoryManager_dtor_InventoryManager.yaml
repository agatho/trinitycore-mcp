  signature: void InventoryManager::~InventoryManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InventoryManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~InventoryManager destructor is automatically invoked when an InventoryManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of inventory-related data structures, including releasing memory allocated
    for item containers, clearing reference counts, and notifying the game server
    of any pending inventory changes. The destructor is part of the standard C++ RAII
    (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern and should not be called manually
    unless performing explicit object destruction. It is typically invoked during
    player logout, character deletion, or when the owning object is destroyed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destructor Call
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    // InventoryManager will\
      \ be automatically destroyed here\n    // when player object goes out of scope\
      \ or is deleted\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for preventing
    memory leaks and maintaining data integrity. It may trigger database synchronization
    to persist inventory changes before destruction. Developers should not manually
    invoke this destructor unless implementing custom object management patterns.
