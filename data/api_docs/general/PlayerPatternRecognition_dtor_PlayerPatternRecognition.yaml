  method: ~PlayerPatternRecognition
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::~PlayerPatternRecognition()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerPatternRecognition instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerPatternRecognition class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    This method is automatically invoked when a PlayerPatternRecognition object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's player
    behavior system, this class likely manages pattern recognition data for player
    actions, such as movement patterns or interaction sequences. The destructor ensures
    proper resource deallocation to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability
    during player logout or session termination.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerPatternRecognition instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PlayerPatternRecognition recognizer;\n    //\
      \ ... use recognizer ...\n    // recognizer is automatically destroyed here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of PlayerPatternRecognition pointer
    code: 'PlayerPatternRecognition* recognizer = new PlayerPatternRecognition();

      // ... use recognizer ...

      delete recognizer; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory
    through pointers. TrinityCore's object lifecycle management typically handles
    destruction automatically. If this class holds references to other objects, those
    references should be properly invalidated or cleared in the destructor to prevent
    dangling pointers.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it will
    lead to undefined behavior. Be cautious when using raw pointers to PlayerPatternRecognition
    objects; ensure proper cleanup to avoid memory leaks.
