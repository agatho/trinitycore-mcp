documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's honor next level threshold based on current honor points
    and progression.
  description: The UpdateHonorNextLevel method recalculates and updates the honor
    points required for the player to reach their next honor level. This method is
    typically invoked when a player's honor points change, ensuring that the client
    UI accurately reflects the progress toward the next honor tier. It handles internal
    state management for honor progression and may trigger UI updates or notifications
    to the player. The method does not directly modify honor points but adjusts the
    threshold needed for advancement.

    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateHonorNextLevel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core when honor points
    are gained or lost. Developers should not need to call this manually unless implementing
    custom honor progression logic.
