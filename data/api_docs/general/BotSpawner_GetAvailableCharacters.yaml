api:
  class: BotSpawner
  method: GetAvailableCharacters
  signature: int BotSpawner::GetAvailableCharacters(uint32 accountId, const int &
    request)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of available bot characters for a given account ID.
  description: The GetAvailableCharacters method determines how many bot characters
    are currently available for use by a specific player account. This method is typically
    used in the context of TrinityCore's bot system, where players can manage and
    spawn automated characters (bots) to assist with various gameplay activities such
    as questing, grinding, or testing. The method takes an account ID and a request
    parameter that may influence how the count is calculated or filtered. It returns
    an integer representing the number of available bot characters associated with
    the specified account.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the player account for which to retrieve
      available bot characters. This value must correspond to a valid account in the
      database.
  - name: request
    description: An integer reference that may be used to specify additional filtering
      criteria or request types when determining available characters. The exact meaning
      and usage of this parameter depends on internal implementation logic within
      the BotSpawner class.
  returns: An integer representing the number of bot characters currently available
    for use by the specified account. Returns zero if no bots are available or if
    an error occurs during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint request = 0;\nint availableCount = botSpawner->GetAvailableCharacters(accountId,\
      \ request);\nif (availableCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spawning bots\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Request Parameter for Filtering
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint request = 1; // Example: filter by specific\
      \ bot type or status\nint availableCount = botSpawner->GetAvailableCharacters(accountId,\
      \ request);\nif (availableCount > 0)\n{\n    // Spawn bots based on filtered\
      \ results\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to fetch information about
    bot characters associated with the given account. It may perform caching or query
    optimization internally, depending on how the BotSpawner class is implemented.
    The request parameter could be used for future extensibility to support different
    filtering mechanisms.
  warnings: Ensure that the accountId provided corresponds to an existing account
    in the database; otherwise, the method might return unexpected results or throw
    exceptions. Be cautious when using the request parameter as its behavior may not
    be fully documented and could change with updates.
