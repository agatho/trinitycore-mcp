  signature: void ComplaintTicket::SetMinorCategoryFlags(ReportMinorCategory minorCategoryFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minor category flags for a complaint ticket, defining the specific
    type of report being submitted.
  description: The SetMinorCategoryFlags method assigns a set of minor category flags
    to a ComplaintTicket instance. These flags define the precise nature of the complaint
    or report being filed by a player. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    this method is used internally to categorize player complaints for administrative
    review and processing. The minor category flags help distinguish between different
    types of violations such as harassment, cheating, or game exploit abuse. This
    method typically follows the initialization of a ticket and before it is submitted
    to the complaint system.
  parameters:
  - name: minorCategoryFlags
    description: A ReportMinorCategory enum value that specifies the detailed type
      of complaint being reported. Valid values include categories like REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_CHAT,
      REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_GUILD, REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_TRADE, and others related
      to specific game interactions or behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Chat Violation Flag
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ticket->SetMinorCategoryFlags(REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_CHAT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Minor Category Flags
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ReportMinorCategory flags = REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_CHAT | REPORT_MINOR_CATEGORY_GUILD;

      ticket->SetMinorCategoryFlags(flags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other ticket management
    functions and should be called before the ticket is finalized. The minor category
    flags are stored internally as bit flags, allowing for multiple categories to
    be combined in a single complaint.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the minor category flags may result in the complaint
    being misclassified or ignored by the administrative system. Ensure that the provided
    ReportMinorCategory value corresponds to valid game interaction types.
