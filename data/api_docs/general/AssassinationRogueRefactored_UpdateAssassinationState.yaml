  method: UpdateAssassinationState
  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::UpdateAssassinationState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state of the assassination rogue class, including combo
    points, abilities, and combat mechanics.
  description: The UpdateAssassinationState method is responsible for maintaining
    and updating the current state of an assassination rogue character within the
    TrinityCore framework. This includes managing combo points, checking ability cooldowns,
    updating target information, and ensuring that all relevant combat mechanics are
    properly synchronized with the player's current actions. The method typically
    gets called during combat updates or when specific events occur that affect the
    rogue's tactical positioning or resource management. It serves as a central coordination
    point for the rogue's assassination specialization logic, ensuring that abilities
    like Mutilate, Garrote, and other stealth-based attacks are properly tracked and
    executed based on the current state of the character.

  examples:
  - title: Basic State Update Call
    code: "void UpdateAssassinationState()\n{\n    // Called during combat tick\n\
      \    if (m_player->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        m_assassinationRogue->UpdateAssassinationState();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    Unit::Update(diff);\n    \n  \
      \  if (IsInCombat())\n    {\n        if (GetSpecialization() == SPEC_ASSASSINATION)\n\
      \        {\n            m_assassinationRogue->UpdateAssassinationState();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure accurate
    tracking of combo points and ability states. The implementation may involve checking
    for target validity, updating cooldown timers, and managing stealth state transitions.
    Performance is critical as this method may be called frequently during active
    combat.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of combat or without proper
    player state checks can lead to incorrect combo point tracking or ability execution.
    Ensure that all prerequisite conditions are met before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior.
