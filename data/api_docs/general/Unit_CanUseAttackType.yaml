  method: CanUseAttackType
  signature: bool Unit::CanUseAttackType(uint8 attacktype) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit can use a specific attack type.
  description: This method checks if a Unit (such as a player or creature) is capable
    of using a particular attack type, which is defined by the attacktype parameter.
    It evaluates various conditions including weapon compatibility, stance requirements,
    and class-specific restrictions to determine if the attack type can be used. The
    method is commonly used in combat mechanics to validate attack actions before
    execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit can use the specified attack type, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the attack type is valid for the current unit's state and
    configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->CanUseAttackType(ATTACK_TYPE_NORMAL)) {\n    // Perform normal\
      \ attack\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically relies on internal state checks and may involve complex
    logic related to stance, weapon type, and class-specific abilities. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple boolean check.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combat situations as incorrect
    usage can lead to invalid attack attempts or failed attacks. Ensure that the attacktype
    parameter aligns with valid game mechanics.
