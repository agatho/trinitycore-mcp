  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CheckItemRequirement
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckItemRequirement(::Player * bot, uint32
    itemId, uint32 count) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the required items for interaction.
  description: The CheckItemRequirement method validates whether a specified player
    possesses the necessary quantity of a given item. This function is typically used
    in quest or interaction validation logic to ensure players meet prerequisites
    before proceeding with certain actions or dialogues. It performs a lookup within
    the player's inventory to determine if the required item count is available.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character being validated.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item to check for in the player's inventory.
  - name: count
    description: The minimum required quantity of the specified item.
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified count of the given
    item; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (validator.CheckItemRequirement(player, 12345, 2)) {\n    // Player\
      \ has at least 2 of item ID 12345\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You\
      \ have the required items.\");\n} else {\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You need more items.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Quest Logic
    code: "uint32 requiredItem = 18765;\nuint32 requiredCount = 5;\nif (validator.CheckItemRequirement(player,\
      \ requiredItem, requiredCount)) {\n    // Proceed with quest completion or reward\n\
      \    player->AddItem(requiredItem, requiredCount);\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Notify player they lack sufficient items\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not have enough %s.\", sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(requiredItem)->Name[0]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the player's inventory; it only checks for item
    availability. It may be used in conjunction with other validation functions to
    build comprehensive interaction rules.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId provided corresponds to an actual item in the game
    database, as invalid IDs could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during lookup.
