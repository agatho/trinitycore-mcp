  class: GameEventMgr
  method: ChangeEquipOrModel
  signature: void GameEventMgr::ChangeEquipOrModel(int16 event_id, bool activate)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates equipment and model changes for a specified game
    event.
  description: The ChangeEquipOrModel method manages the application of equipment
    and model modifications associated with a specific game event. When activated,
    it applies the event's defined equipment and model overrides to applicable creatures
    and game objects. When deactivated, it reverts these changes, restoring the original
    states. This method is typically used in conjunction with game event systems to
    dynamically modify in-game visuals and item configurations during special occasions
    or seasonal events.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event for which equipment and model
      changes should be applied or reverted. Must be a valid event ID registered with
      the GameEventMgr.
  - name: activate
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to activate (true) or deactivate
      (false) the event's equipment and model modifications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate Equipment and Model Changes for Event 42
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->ChangeEquipOrModel(42, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate Equipment and Model Changes for Event 42
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->ChangeEquipOrModel(42, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the global GameEventMgr singleton instance. It is
    typically called during game event start/end times to modify creature appearances
    or inventory items. The changes are applied immediately and affect all creatures
    and objects currently registered with the specified event.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual inconsistencies or incorrect
    item displays. Ensure that event IDs are valid and that equipment/model definitions
    exist before calling this method. Avoid frequent toggling during active gameplay
    as it may cause performance issues.
