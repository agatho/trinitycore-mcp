  class: FormationUtils
  method: CalculateOptimalSpacing
  signature: float FormationUtils::CalculateOptimalSpacing(const int & members, FormationType
    formation)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal spacing between members of a formation based on formation
    type and member count.
  description: The CalculateOptimalSpacing method determines the appropriate distance
    between units in a group formation. This utility is used primarily for positioning
    AI-controlled creatures or player characters within structured formations such
    as lines, circles, or groups. The calculation takes into account both the number
    of members in the formation and the specific formation type to ensure proper spacing
    for gameplay mechanics like combat positioning, movement coordination, and visual
    grouping. The method returns a float value representing the calculated spacing
    distance in game units (typically yards). This function is essential for maintaining
    consistent and visually appealing group formations across different scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: members
    description: The number of members in the formation. Must be a positive integer
      greater than zero.
  - name: formation
    description: The type of formation to calculate spacing for. Should be one of
      the predefined FormationType enum values such as LINE, CIRCLE, or GROUP.
  returns: A float value representing the optimal spacing distance between members
    in the specified formation. Returns 0.0 if invalid parameters are provided.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate spacing for a line formation with 5 members
    code: 'float spacing = FormationUtils::CalculateOptimalSpacing(5, LINE);

      // Returns optimal spacing for a line of 5 units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using calculated spacing in formation positioning
    code: 'int memberCount = 3;

      FormationType type = CIRCLE;

      float spacing = FormationUtils::CalculateOptimalSpacing(memberCount, type);

      // Use ''spacing'' to position units in a circular formation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all members of the formation have similar size and
    movement characteristics. The actual implementation may vary based on game engine
    settings or configuration files. For performance-critical code paths, consider
    caching results for frequently used member counts and formation types.
  warnings: Passing negative values or zero for 'members' will likely result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect spacing calculations. Ensure that the FormationType parameter
    corresponds to valid predefined formation types to avoid unexpected results.
