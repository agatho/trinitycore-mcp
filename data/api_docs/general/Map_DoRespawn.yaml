  signature: void Map::DoRespawn(SpawnObjectType type, int spawnId, uint32 gridId)
documentation:
  brief: Respawns objects of a specified type and spawn ID on the given grid.
  description: The DoRespawn method is responsible for respawning game objects such
    as creatures or game objects on a specific grid within the map. It takes into
    account the spawn type (creature or game object), a unique spawn identifier, and
    the grid ID where the respawn should occur. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with spawn management systems to restore entities that have been despawned or
    removed from the world. The method ensures that objects are properly re-added
    to the map's active state at their designated locations.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of object to respawn, indicating whether it is a creature
      or game object. Valid values are typically defined by an enumeration such as
      SpawnObjectType::Creature or SpawnObjectType::GameObject.
  - name: spawnId
    description: A unique identifier for the specific spawn instance. This ID corresponds
      to a particular spawn point or group of spawns within the map's spawn system.
  - name: gridId
    description: The grid ID where the respawn should occur. Grids are used in TrinityCore
      to manage spatial partitioning and optimize object loading and unloading.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Respawn a creature on grid 1234
    code: map->DoRespawn(SpawnObjectType::Creature, 5678, 1234);
    language: cpp
  - title: Respawn a game object on grid 9012
    code: map->DoRespawn(SpawnObjectType::GameObject, 3456, 9012);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the map's internal spawn management system and should
    only be called when necessary to avoid performance issues. It assumes that the
    spawn data for the given type and ID exists within the map's spawn manager.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the spawn data can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the provided spawnId corresponds
    to an existing spawn entry before calling this method.
