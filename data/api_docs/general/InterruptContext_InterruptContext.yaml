  class: InterruptContext
  method: InterruptContext
  signature: void InterruptContext::InterruptContext(int caster, uint32 spell, uint32
    interrupt)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an interrupt context for handling spell interruption events in
    the game engine.
  description: The InterruptContext constructor initializes a context used to manage
    and process spell interruption events within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    sets up internal state variables that track caster information, spell identifiers,
    and interruption types. It is typically invoked when a spell casting is interrupted
    by external factors such as damage, movement, or other game mechanics. The method
    prepares the context for subsequent processing of interruption logic without directly
    performing any interruption actions itself.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The identifier (GUID) of the unit that initiated the spell casting.
      This parameter determines which entity's casting state will be affected by the
      interruption.
  - name: spell
    description: The SpellID of the spell being interrupted. This identifies the specific
      spell whose casting process is being halted or modified.
  - name: interrupt
    description: The type of interruption to be processed, typically representing
      an interrupt flag or mechanism such as 'Interrupted by damage' or 'Interrupted
      by movement'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Context Initialization
    code: 'InterruptContext context(12345, 98765, 1);

      // Initializes an interrupt context for caster ID 12345,

      // spell ID 98765, with interruption type 1 (e.g., damage interrupt)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt Context in Spell Handling
    code: "void HandleSpellInterrupt(Unit* caster, uint32 spellId, uint32 interruptType)\n\
      {\n    InterruptContext context(caster->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), spellId, interruptType);\n\
      \    // Further processing of the interruption context\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal game state management system and should
    only be called during appropriate spell handling phases. The parameters must represent
    valid entity identifiers and spell IDs within the TrinityCore database to ensure
    correct behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values may lead to undefined behavior or crashes in
    the spell interruption system. Ensure that the caster GUID, spell ID, and interrupt
    type are all valid before calling this method.
