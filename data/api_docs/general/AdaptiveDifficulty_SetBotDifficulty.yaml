  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: SetBotDifficulty
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::SetBotDifficulty(BotAI * bot, float difficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the difficulty level for a specified bot AI instance.
  description: The SetBotDifficulty method configures the adaptive difficulty setting
    for a given BotAI object. This allows developers to adjust how challenging an
    AI-controlled bot should be, which is particularly useful in game modes where
    dynamic difficulty adjustment enhances player engagement. The method modifies
    internal difficulty parameters within the bot's AI framework without requiring
    a complete reinitialization of the AI system. It is typically used during runtime
    to modify bot behavior based on game state or player performance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance whose difficulty level will be modified.
      Must not be null.
  - name: difficulty
    description: Floating-point value representing the desired difficulty level for
      the bot. Typically ranges from 0.0 (easiest) to 1.0 (hardest), though exact
      values may depend on game implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAI* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      AdaptiveDifficulty::SetBotDifficulty(myBot, 0.75f);

      // Sets the bot''s difficulty to 75%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
    code: "void AdjustBotDifficulty(Player* player, BotAI* bot) {\n    float playerSkill\
      \ = CalculatePlayerSkill(player);\n    float newDifficulty = std::min(1.0f,\
      \ std::max(0.1f, playerSkill * 0.8f));\n    AdaptiveDifficulty::SetBotDifficulty(bot,\
      \ newDifficulty);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the bot's internal difficulty state and may
    affect AI decision-making processes such as target selection, spell usage, and
    combat tactics. It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections of
    code since it might trigger recalculations within the bot's AI subsystem.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'bot' will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crash. Ensure that the difficulty value is within valid bounds (typically 0.0
    to 1.0) to avoid unexpected AI behavior.
