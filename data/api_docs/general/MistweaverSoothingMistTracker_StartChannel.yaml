  method: StartChannel
  signature: void MistweaverSoothingMistTracker::StartChannel(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the channeling of Soothing Mist for a specified player GUID
  description: The StartChannel method begins the process of channeling the Soothing
    Mist ability for a given player identified by their GUID. This method is typically
    invoked when a Mistweaver player activates the Soothing Mist spell, which allows
    them to heal allies over time. The method sets up internal tracking mechanisms
    to manage the channel duration, healing application, and resource consumption.
    It ensures that the channeling state is properly initialized for the specified
    player within the context of the Mistweaver's healing rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is starting to channel
      Soothing Mist. This value must correspond to a valid player object in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MistweaverSoothingMistTracker tracker;

      tracker.StartChannel(123456); // Begins channeling for player with GUID 123456'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player with the given GUID is a valid Mistweaver
    class and has sufficient resources to begin channeling. The actual healing effects
    are applied during the channel duration through separate update mechanisms.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the player's class or
    available resources may lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the healing system.
