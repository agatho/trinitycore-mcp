  class: PathfindingManager
  method: SetMaxNodes
  signature: void PathfindingManager::SetMaxNodes(uint32 maxNodes)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of nodes allowed for pathfinding calculations.
  description: The SetMaxNodes method configures the upper limit on the number of
    nodes that can be processed during pathfinding operations within the PathfindingManager.
    This parameter directly influences the complexity and performance of pathfinding
    algorithms, particularly in environments with high node density or complex navigation
    meshes. Adjusting this value allows developers to balance between pathfinding
    accuracy and computational efficiency. The method is typically used during initialization
    or configuration phases to tune pathfinding behavior for specific map layouts
    or game scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: maxNodes
    description: The maximum number of nodes that the pathfinding system will process
      in a single operation. Valid values are positive integers. Higher values allow
      for more complex paths but may increase memory usage and processing time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Nodes for Pathfinding
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = sPathfindingManager;

      manager->SetMaxNodes(5000);

      // Configures the pathfinding system to process up to 5000 nodes per operation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Pathfinding Node Limit Adjustment
    code: "void AdjustPathfindingLimit(uint32 newLimit)\n{\n    if (newLimit > 1000\
      \ && newLimit < 50000)\n    {\n        sPathfindingManager->SetMaxNodes(newLimit);\n\
      \        TC_LOG_INFO(\"pathfinding\", \"Pathfinding node limit updated to %u\"\
      , newLimit);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"pathfinding\",\
      \ \"Invalid node limit: %u\", newLimit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all subsequent pathfinding operations performed by the
    PathfindingManager instance. Changes to this value may require reinitialization
    of internal data structures and could impact existing path calculations. The default
    value is typically set based on map complexity and performance requirements.
  warnings: Setting maxNodes too low may result in incomplete or suboptimal paths,
    while setting it too high can cause performance degradation or memory issues.
    This method should be used carefully during development and testing phases to
    ensure optimal balance between pathfinding quality and system resources.
