  method: CommandPetStay
  signature: void HunterAI::CommandPetStay()
documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to stop moving and remain in place.
  description: The CommandPetStay method instructs the hunter's summoned pet to cease
    all movement and remain stationary at its current location. This command is typically
    issued when the hunter wants to hold their pet in position, often during combat
    situations where positioning is critical. The method affects the pet's AI behavior
    by setting its movement state to 'stay' mode, which suppresses any automatic following
    or roaming behavior. This functionality aligns with the hunter class's control
    mechanics over their companion, allowing for tactical positioning during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Hunter AI Context
    code: "void MyHunterAI::HandleCombatSituation()\n{\n    // When entering a combat\
      \ stance that requires pet positioning\n    CommandPetStay();\n    // Pet will\
      \ now remain stationary until further command\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the HunterAI class and directly interacts with the
    pet's movement state. It should be called in response to combat situations or
    tactical positioning needs. The implementation likely modifies internal pet AI
    flags or states rather than sending network messages directly.
  warnings: Ensure this method is only called when the pet has been successfully summoned
    and is under the hunter's control. Calling it on a non-existent or uncontrolled
    pet may result in undefined behavior or errors.
