  signature: bool TargetScanner::IsHealer(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified target unit is classified as a healer in
    the context of AI targeting logic.
  description: The IsHealer method evaluates whether a given Unit object is categorized
    as a healer within the TrinityCore AI system. This classification typically involves
    checking the unit's role, class, or specific AI behavior flags that indicate healing
    capabilities. The method is commonly used by AI scripts and target selection logic
    to prioritize or avoid certain types of units during combat scenarios. It may
    consider factors such as the unit's current spell casting state, pet ownership,
    or predefined healer roles assigned to NPCs. This functionality is crucial for
    intelligent targeting systems in both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player
    (PvP) contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is classified as a healer; otherwise, returns
    false. A healer unit typically has abilities or behaviors associated with healing,
    such as casting healing spells or having a healing pet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI targeting
    code: "if (scanner.IsHealer(targetUnit))\n{\n    // Avoid targeting healers in\
      \ certain combat strategies\n    targetUnit = nullptr;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsHealer to filter targets for AoE abilities
    code: "if (scanner.IsHealer(target))\n{\n    // Skip healers when using area-of-effect\
      \ damage spells\n    continue;\n}\n// Apply damage to non-healers\nApplyDamage(target);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely relies on internal unit classification flags or
    spell casting state checks. This method may not be suitable for real-time performance-critical
    code due to potential complex condition evaluations. It's recommended to cache
    the result if the same target is evaluated multiple times.
  warnings: This method might return false positives or negatives depending on how
    the AI system classifies units. Ensure that your logic accounts for edge cases
    where a unit may temporarily not be actively healing but still qualifies as a
    healer based on its role or class.
