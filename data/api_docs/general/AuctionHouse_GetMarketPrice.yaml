api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetMarketPrice
  signature: float AuctionHouse::GetMarketPrice(uint32 itemId, uint32 stackSize)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the market price for a specified item based on current
    auction house data.
  description: The GetMarketPrice method retrieves the average or calculated market
    value of a given item in the auction house system. This function is typically
    used to determine fair pricing for items being listed or to provide players with
    an estimate of an item's worth. The calculation may take into account recent bids,
    buyouts, and historical data from the auction house. It's important to note that
    this price can fluctuate based on supply and demand within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which to retrieve the market
      price. This corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in the database.
  - name: stackSize
    description: The number of items in the stack for which to calculate the market
      price. This affects the total value returned, especially for items that can
      be stacked.
  returns: A float representing the calculated market price for the specified item
    and stack size. Returns 0.0 if the item is not found or if there's insufficient
    data to determine a valid price.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float price = auctionHouse->GetMarketPrice(12345, 1);

      // Returns the market price for one unit of item ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stacked Item Pricing
    code: 'uint32 itemId = 67890;

      uint32 stackSize = 20;

      float totalPrice = auctionHouse->GetMarketPrice(itemId, stackSize);

      // Returns the total market price for a stack of 20 items of ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries to fetch recent auction data. It's
    recommended to cache results when frequently querying the same item IDs to improve
    performance. The returned value is an approximation and may not reflect real-time
    market conditions.
  warnings: The method might return 0.0 for items that are not currently auctioned
    or have no recent transaction history, which could lead to incorrect pricing assumptions
    if not handled properly in calling code.
