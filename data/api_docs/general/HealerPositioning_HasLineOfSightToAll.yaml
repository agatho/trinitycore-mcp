  class: HealerPositioning
  method: HasLineOfSightToAll
  signature: bool HealerPositioning::HasLineOfSightToAll(const int & healerPos, const
    int & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a healer has line of sight to all specified allies.
  description: The HasLineOfSightToAll method determines whether a healer unit can
    maintain unobstructed vision to every ally within a given set. This is crucial
    for healing mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly when determining if a
    healer can effectively target and cast spells on multiple allies without being
    blocked by environment or other units. The method evaluates the spatial relationship
    between the healer's position and each ally's position, ensuring no obstacles
    impede the line of sight. It returns true only if all allies are within clear
    view of the healer.
  parameters:
  - name: healerPos
    description: The integer-based position identifier or coordinate of the healer
      unit in the game world. This typically represents a unique location or index
      used by the TrinityCore engine to track unit positions.
  - name: allies
    description: An integer representing a collection or bitmask of ally positions
      or identifiers that the healer must have line of sight to. The exact format
      depends on how allies are stored and referenced within the AI system.
  returns: Returns true if the healer has unobstructed line of sight to all specified
    allies, false otherwise. If any ally is blocked by an obstacle or another unit,
    the method will return false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check line of sight for a group of allies
    code: "int healerPosition = 100;\nint allyGroup = 0b111; // Example bitmask representing\
      \ 3 allies\nbool result = healerPositioning.HasLineOfSightToAll(healerPosition,\
      \ allyGroup);\nif (result) {\n    // Proceed with healing logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal pathfinding or raycasting algorithms to
    determine visibility. Performance may be impacted when checking many allies simultaneously.
    The method assumes that positions are valid and properly initialized within the
    game world context.
  warnings: Ensure that both healerPos and allies parameters represent valid units/positions
    in the current game state, as invalid inputs could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results.
