documentation:
  brief: Destroys a scoped learning session, cleaning up associated resources and
    reverting temporary changes.
  description: The ~ScopedLearningSession destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up and finalizing a learning session that was initiated using the ScopedLearningSession
    class. This method ensures that any temporary modifications or state changes made
    during the session are reverted, resources are freed, and the system returns to
    its original state. It typically handles cleanup of internal data structures,
    resets player learning states, and may notify other subsystems about the completion
    of the learning process. The destructor is automatically invoked when the ScopedLearningSession
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Function Scope
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ScopedLearningSession session;\n    // Perform\
      \ learning operations here\n    // Session automatically destroyed when going\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion Example
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    ScopedLearningSession* session = new ScopedLearningSession();\n\
      \    // Perform learning operations\n    delete session; // Triggers destructor\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, meaning it can be safely called on base class
    pointers to derived class objects. The destructor should not throw exceptions
    as it's called during stack unwinding. It's recommended to avoid calling this
    destructor directly unless explicitly managing object lifetime.
  warnings: Do not manually call the destructor unless you're explicitly managing
    object lifecycle. The destructor assumes that all learning operations have been
    completed or properly rolled back. Calling it in an inconsistent state may lead
    to resource leaks or corrupted internal state.
