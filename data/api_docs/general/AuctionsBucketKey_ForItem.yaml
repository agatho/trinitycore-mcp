  class: AuctionsBucketKey
  method: ForItem
  signature: AuctionsBucketKey AuctionsBucketKey::ForItem(const Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new AuctionsBucketKey instance based on the provided
    item's properties for use in auction house bucket management.
  description: The ForItem method constructs an AuctionsBucketKey object using the
    specified item's identifying characteristics, primarily its item template ID and
    other relevant properties. This key is used internally by the auction house system
    to group similar items into buckets for efficient processing and display. The
    method ensures that items with identical properties are correctly categorized
    together within the auction system's bucket structure. It serves as a factory
    method for generating bucket keys from item data, which is essential for maintaining
    organized and performant auction listings.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AuctionsBucketKey object initialized with the relevant properties of
    the input item, suitable for use in auction house bucket operations.
  examples:
  - title: Creating an AuctionsBucketKey from an Item
    code: "Item* myItem = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, 0);\nif (myItem)\n\
      {\n    AuctionsBucketKey bucketKey = AuctionsBucketKey::ForItem(myItem);\n \
      \   // Use bucketKey for auction house operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses item properties such as class, subclass, and
    quality to construct the bucket key. It may be used internally by the auction
    house system when processing new auctions or querying existing ones.
