documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotWorldSessionMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotWorldSessionMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global bot world session
    management functionality, which handles bot-related world sessions, their creation,
    destruction, and management within the TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer
    provides access to all bot session-related operations such as adding/removing
    bots, managing their states, and handling session-specific events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotWorldSessionMgr instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer to the singleton instance; it never returns NULL.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Bot World Session Manager
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgr* sessionMgr = BotWorldSessionMgr::instance();

      // Use sessionMgr to manage bot sessions

      sessionMgr->AddBotSession(botSession);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is typically initialized
    during application startup. The implementation relies on a static local variable
    which ensures proper initialization even in multi-threaded environments.
