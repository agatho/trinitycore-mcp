documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a possessed creature enters combat, typically invoked
    by the AI system.
  description: The JustEnteredCombat method is called when a possessed creature (such
    as a player-controlled NPC or summoned creature) transitions into combat state.
    This method is part of the PossessedAI class and is responsible for executing
    specific behaviors or actions upon entering combat. It may be used to initialize
    combat-related variables, trigger special abilities, or notify other systems about
    the change in state. The method does not take any parameters and is typically
    invoked internally by the TrinityCore AI framework when a possessed creature's
    combat state changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Custom AI
    code: "class MyPossessedAI : public PossessedAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEnteredCombat(int*\
      \ who) override {\n        // Custom logic when entering combat\n        SendChatMessage(\"\
      I'm in combat!\");\n        // Call base implementation if needed\n        PossessedAI::JustEnteredCombat(who);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be overridden by derived AI classes to implement
    custom behavior. It's typically called during the AI update cycle when a possessed
    creature begins combat, and should not be called directly unless necessary for
    inheritance purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that any custom implementation of JustEnteredCombat does not cause
    infinite loops or recursive calls that could lead to stack overflow. Be cautious
    when modifying state within this method as it may affect the creature's behavior
    during combat.
