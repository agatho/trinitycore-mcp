  class: Unit
  method: ReplaceAllUnitFlags3
  signature: void Unit::ReplaceAllUnitFlags3(UnitFlags3 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all unit flags with the specified UnitFlags3 value
  description: This method replaces all existing unit flags on a Unit object with
    the provided UnitFlags3 value. It is used to completely reset or update the flags
    that define a unit's state and behavior in the game world. The method ensures
    that only the specified flags are set, removing any previous flags that may have
    been present. This functionality is commonly used when updating unit states during
    combat or movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The UnitFlags3 value to replace all current unit flags with. This
      parameter defines the new state of the unit's flags, including any combination
      of flags such as unit flags, dynamic flags, or other flag types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();

      UnitFlags3 newFlags = UNIT_FLAG_PVP;

      target->ReplaceAllUnitFlags3(newFlags);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = GetPlayer();

      UnitFlags3 flags = UNIT_FLAG_SIT;

      player->ReplaceAllUnitFlags3(flags);

      // This sets the player to sit mode, removing all other flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other flag manipulation
    methods to ensure complete control over unit state. It may be called during combat
    or movement updates where flag changes are required. Performance considerations
    include avoiding frequent flag updates as they can impact game object processing.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected behavior in unit states,
    particularly if flags are not properly set. Care should be taken when using this
    method to ensure that all previous flags are correctly removed before setting
    new ones.
