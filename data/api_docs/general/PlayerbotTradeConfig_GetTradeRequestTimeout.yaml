  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: GetTradeRequestTimeout
  signature: uint32 PlayerbotTradeConfig::GetTradeRequestTimeout()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the timeout duration for trade requests in milliseconds.
  description: This method returns the configured timeout value for player bot trade
    requests. When a player bot initiates a trade with another player, this timeout
    determines how long the bot will wait for a response before automatically canceling
    the trade request. The value is typically defined in the configuration files and
    represents the maximum time interval (in milliseconds) that a trade request can
    remain pending. This mechanism helps prevent stale trade requests from hanging
    indefinitely and ensures efficient resource management within the player bot system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the timeout duration for trade requests in
    milliseconds. This value indicates how long a trade request will be allowed to
    remain active before being automatically canceled by the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 timeout = playerbotTradeConfig->GetTradeRequestTimeout();

      LOG_INFO("playerbot", "Trade request timeout is set to {} milliseconds", timeout);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Timeout in Trade Logic
    code: "uint32 timeout = playerbotTradeConfig->GetTradeRequestTimeout();\nif (timeout\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Schedule trade request cancellation after timeout\n    scheduler.ScheduleAtTime(timeout,\
      \ [this]() {\n        CancelPendingTradeRequest();\n    });\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned value is typically loaded from the configuration file (e.g.,
    playerbot.conf) and represents a fixed timeout duration. This method should be
    called frequently to ensure consistent behavior across different game states.
    The timeout value may vary between different server configurations or player bot
    profiles.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned timeout value is within
    acceptable ranges. It's recommended to verify that the timeout value is reasonable
    (e.g., not zero or excessively large) before using it in time-sensitive operations.
