documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all quest giver data from the database into memory
    for active quest handling.
  description: The LoadQuestGiverDatabase method is responsible for loading all quest
    giver information from the TrinityCore database into the server's memory. This
    includes fetching quest IDs, associated NPC identifiers, quest requirements, rewards,
    and other metadata needed to properly handle quest turn-ins and interactions.
    The method typically executes during server startup or when quest data needs to
    be refreshed. It ensures that all quest givers in the game world have their quest
    data available for player interaction, enabling proper quest progression mechanics.
    This method is crucial for maintaining accurate quest state and preventing issues
    with missing or outdated quest information.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeQuestSystem()\n{\n    sQuestTurnIn->LoadQuestGiverDatabase();\n\
      \    // Quest givers are now ready for player interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    database content is known to have changed. Repeated calls may cause duplicate
    entries or performance degradation. The method performs database queries and caching
    operations that could block the main thread if not properly managed.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate quest giver entries. It should not be invoked during
    active gameplay sessions as it may disrupt ongoing quest states.
