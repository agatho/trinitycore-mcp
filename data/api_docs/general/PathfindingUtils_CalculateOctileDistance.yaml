  signature: float PathfindingUtils::CalculateOctileDistance(const int & a, const
    int & b)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the octile distance between two points in a grid-based pathfinding
    system.
  description: The CalculateOctileDistance method computes the octile distance, which
    is a heuristic used in pathfinding algorithms like A* to estimate the cost of
    moving from one point to another on a grid. This distance metric accounts for
    both horizontal/vertical movement (cost 1) and diagonal movement (cost sqrt(2)),
    making it more accurate than Manhattan distance for grid-based environments. The
    method takes two integer parameters representing coordinates in a grid system,
    typically used for NPC movement or AI pathfinding calculations within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: a
    description: The first coordinate value (typically x or y position) used to calculate
      the distance.
  - name: b
    description: The second coordinate value (typically x or y position) used to calculate
      the distance.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the octile distance between the two
    points. The result is always non-negative and represents the estimated movement
    cost in a grid-based pathfinding system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for calculating distance between two grid points
    code: 'int x1 = 10, y1 = 15;

      int x2 = 20, y2 = 25;

      float distance = PathfindingUtils::CalculateOctileDistance(x1, x2); // Calculates
      horizontal distance

      // Note: This example assumes a simplified usage; actual implementation likely
      requires both coordinates'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using octile distance in pathfinding context
    code: "class Pathfinder {\npublic:\n    float EstimateCost(int startX, int startY,\
      \ int endX, int endY) {\n        return PathfindingUtils::CalculateOctileDistance(startX,\
      \ endX) + \n               PathfindingUtils::CalculateOctileDistance(startY,\
      \ endY);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in pathfinding algorithms to provide an admissible
    heuristic that estimates the minimum cost to reach a goal. The octile distance
    is particularly useful for grid-based movement where diagonal moves are allowed
    at a cost of sqrt(2). Performance-wise, this method is very fast as it only performs
    basic arithmetic operations.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes two integer parameters but does
    not specify which coordinate system it operates on. Developers should ensure that
    the parameters passed represent valid coordinates in the intended grid space.
    Incorrect parameter ordering may lead to unexpected results.
