documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a guild object by its name from the guild manager.
  description: The GetGuildByName method searches through all registered guilds within
    the TrinityCore server instance and returns a pointer to the Guild object that
    matches the specified guild name. This method is commonly used in game logic to
    perform operations on specific guilds, such as checking membership, modifying
    guild properties, or handling guild-related events. The method performs a case-sensitive
    lookup and will return NULL if no guild with the given name exists. It's important
    to note that this function may involve database lookups depending on how the GuildMgr
    is implemented internally.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Guild object if a guild with the specified name exists;
    otherwise, returns NULL if no matching guild is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildByName(\"The Champions\");\nif (guild)\n\
      {\n    // Guild exists, perform operations\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Guild found: %s\", guild->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildByName(\"NonExistentGuild\");\nif (!guild)\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where guild does not exist\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Guild not found.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with guild operations\n   \
      \ guild->SendGuildPacket();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries depending on how the GuildMgr caches
    guild data. It's recommended to cache results if frequently accessed. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the guild exists in memory and has not been deleted.
  warnings: Always check for NULL return values before using the returned Guild pointer
    to avoid segmentation faults. Be cautious when modifying guild data directly through
    this pointer, as it may affect other parts of the system that depend on the guild's
    state.
