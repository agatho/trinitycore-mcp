documentation:
  brief: Sets the specified player flag for the current player.
  description: This method allows developers to set specific player flags that control
    various gameplay behaviors and states within the TrinityCore framework. Player
    flags are used to modify player behavior, such as enabling or disabling certain
    game mechanics, affecting visibility, or changing player state. The method operates
    on the player's internal flag system, which is crucial for implementing custom
    game rules or modifying player behavior in a controlled manner.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player Flag
    code: 'player->SetPlayerFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS_PVP);

    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's internal flags structure. It should
    be used carefully as it affects player behavior and may have unintended side effects
    if not properly understood. The method is typically used in conjunction with other
    flag-related methods like GetPlayerFlag or ResetPlayerFlag.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior changes in
    player state, including disabling crucial game mechanics or affecting visibility.
    It should be used only when necessary and after understanding the implications
    of each flag being set.
