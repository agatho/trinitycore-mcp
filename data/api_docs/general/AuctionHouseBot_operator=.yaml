documentation:
  brief: Moves an AuctionHouseBot instance to another AuctionHouseBot instance, transferring
    all resources and leaving the source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for the AuctionHouseBot class transfers
    ownership of all managed resources from the source object to the target object.
    This operation is typically used when you want to efficiently transfer the state
    of one AuctionHouseBot instance to another without performing expensive deep copies.
    The source object will be left in a valid but unspecified state after the move,
    meaning it should not be used for further operations unless reassigned. In the
    context of TrinityCore's AuctionHouseBot implementation, this method likely handles
    moving internal data structures such as auction lists, configuration settings,
    or resource handles that manage the bot's behavior within the auction house system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target AuctionHouseBot instance after the move operation
    has completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot bot1;

      AuctionHouseBot bot2 = std::move(bot1); // Move bot1 to bot2

      // bot1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'AuctionHouseBot bot1, bot2, bot3;

      bot3 = std::move(bot2) = std::move(bot1); // Chained move assignments

      // bot1 and bot2 are now in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be implemented
    to efficiently transfer resources. The implementation must ensure that the source
    object remains in a valid state after the move, even though its contents are unspecified.
    This method is particularly important for performance optimization when dealing
    with large objects or those managing system resources.
  warnings: After a move operation, the source object should not be used for any operations
    except assignment or destruction. Using it afterward may lead to undefined behavior
    or resource corruption. Additionally, if the AuctionHouseBot manages external
    resources like database connections or file handles, ensure that these are properly
    handled during the move operation.
