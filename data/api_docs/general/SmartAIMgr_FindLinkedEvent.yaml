  class: SmartAIMgr
  method: FindLinkedEvent
  signature: SmartScriptHolder & SmartAIMgr::FindLinkedEvent(SmartAIEventList & list,
    uint32 link)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns a linked SmartScriptHolder event from a list based on the
    specified link ID.
  description: The FindLinkedEvent method searches through a provided SmartAIEventList
    to locate a SmartScriptHolder that matches the given link identifier. This functionality
    is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI system to retrieve specific events that are
    linked together, enabling complex conditional logic and event chaining within
    smart scripts. The method performs a linear search through the list of events
    and returns a reference to the matching SmartScriptHolder. It is typically invoked
    during AI execution when an event needs to be triggered or referenced by another
    event using link-based referencing.
  parameters:
  - name: list
    description: The SmartAIEventList containing the collection of SmartScriptHolder
      events to search through.
  - name: link
    description: The unique identifier (uint32) used to match against the link field
      of SmartScriptHolder events.
  returns: A reference to the SmartScriptHolder that matches the specified link ID.
    If no matching event is found, behavior is undefined and may result in a crash
    or invalid reference.
  examples:
  - title: Finding a linked event in AI script
    code: 'SmartAIEventList eventList;

      // ... populate eventList with SmartScriptHolder events ...

      uint32 targetLink = 12345;

      SmartScriptHolder& foundEvent = sSmartAIMgr->FindLinkedEvent(eventList, targetLink);

      // Use foundEvent for further processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the list parameter contains valid SmartScriptHolder
    objects and that the link ID exists within the list. The method does not perform
    bounds checking or validation on the input parameters, so calling code must ensure
    correctness. Performance is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list.
  warnings: Calling this method with a non-existent link ID will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that all links referenced exist within the provided event list
    before calling this method. The returned reference should not be used after the
    original list has been modified or destroyed.
