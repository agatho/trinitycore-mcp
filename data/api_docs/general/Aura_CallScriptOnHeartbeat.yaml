documentation:
  brief: Invokes the script handler for an aura's heartbeat event, executing scripted
    behavior during each tick.
  description: The CallScriptOnHeartbeat method is responsible for triggering the
    associated script handler of an Aura object during each heartbeat interval. This
    method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when an aura's
    periodic effect needs to be processed. It allows custom scripts attached to auras
    to execute logic such as damage over time, healing effects, or status updates
    at regular intervals. The method does not take any parameters and performs no
    direct return value operations; its purpose is purely to delegate execution to
    the script handler.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Script
    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnHeartbeat()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Custom logic executed on each heartbeat tick\n\
      \        if (GetCaster()->GetHealth() > 0)\n            GetTarget()->CastSpell(GetTarget(),\
      \ SPELL_HEALING_AURA, true);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is generally invoked automatically by the core engine during
    aura tick processing. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom heartbeat logic within a script context. The execution of scripts through
    this method may impact performance if complex operations are performed per tick.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations inside the
    script handler called by this method, as it can cause frame drops or lag in the
    game loop. Also, ensure that all references to target and caster objects remain
    valid during execution to prevent memory access violations.
