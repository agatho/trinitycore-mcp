  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: Update
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown stacking optimizer with the specified time difference.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing cooldown
    stacks within the CooldownStackingOptimizer class. It accepts a time delta (diff)
    in milliseconds and uses this to advance internal cooldown timers, determine when
    cooldowns expire, and manage stack counts accordingly. This method is typically
    called from the game loop or update system to ensure that cooldown states are
    accurately maintained and updated over time. The method performs no direct actions
    on game objects but rather manages the state of cooldown stacks internally.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to advance internal cooldown timers and determine expiration states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      // In game loop or update handler

      uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();

      optimizer.Update(diff);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Custom Time Delta
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      // Simulate time passing in a test scenario

      uint32 customDiff = 1000; // 1 second

      optimizer.Update(customDiff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly, typically once per game tick or update
    cycle. It's important that the diff parameter accurately reflects the elapsed
    time to maintain proper cooldown behavior. The optimizer maintains its own internal
    state and does not require external synchronization.
  warnings: Do not call this method with negative values for diff as it may cause
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the diff value represents actual elapsed time
    rather than arbitrary or simulated values unless specifically intended for testing
    purposes.
