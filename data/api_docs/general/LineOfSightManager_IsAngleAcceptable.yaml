  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsAngleAcceptable
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsAngleAcceptable(const int & from, const int
    & to, float maxAngle)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the angular difference between two angles is within a
    specified maximum angle threshold.
  description: The IsAngleAcceptable method evaluates if the angular difference between
    two given angles (from and to) is less than or equal to a provided maximum angle.
    This utility function is commonly used in game mechanics such as line-of-sight
    calculations, NPC facing behavior, and spell targeting systems where it's necessary
    to determine if an object is within a certain angular field of view. The method
    handles angle wrapping, ensuring correct comparison even when angles cross the
    0/360 degree boundary. It assumes angles are provided in degrees and uses standard
    trigonometric conventions.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting angle in degrees, typically representing a reference
      direction or source orientation.
  - name: to
    description: The target angle in degrees, typically representing the direction
      being evaluated or destination orientation.
  - name: maxAngle
    description: The maximum allowable angular difference in degrees. If the absolute
      difference between 'from' and 'to' is less than or equal to this value, the
      method returns true.
  returns: Returns true if the angular difference between 'from' and 'to' is within
    the specified 'maxAngle'; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Angle Comparison
    code: 'LineOfSightManager losManager;

      int sourceAngle = 45;

      int targetAngle = 60;

      float maxAllowedAngle = 20.0f;

      bool result = losManager.IsAngleAcceptable(sourceAngle, targetAngle, maxAllowedAngle);

      // Result will be true since |60 - 45| = 15 <= 20'
    language: cpp
  - title: Crossing Angle Boundary Check
    code: 'LineOfSightManager losManager;

      int sourceAngle = 350;

      int targetAngle = 10;

      float maxAllowedAngle = 25.0f;

      bool result = losManager.IsAngleAcceptable(sourceAngle, targetAngle, maxAllowedAngle);

      // Result will be true since the shortest angular path is 20 degrees (360 -
      350 + 10), which is <= 25'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs angle normalization to handle cases where angles cross
    the 0/360 degree boundary. It treats all angles as unsigned values in the range
    [0, 360). The implementation assumes that input angles are valid degrees and does
    not perform bounds checking.
  warnings: Be cautious when using large 'maxAngle' values near 180 degrees, as this
    could lead to unexpected behavior due to angle wrapping. Also, ensure that the
    'from' and 'to' parameters represent meaningful angular orientations for your
    specific use case.
