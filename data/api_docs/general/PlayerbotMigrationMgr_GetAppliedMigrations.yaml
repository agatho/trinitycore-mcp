documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of migration identifiers that have been applied to the playerbot
    system
  description: The GetAppliedMigrations method returns a vector of strings representing
    the identifiers of all migrations that have been successfully executed within
    the playerbot framework. This method is typically used during system initialization
    or maintenance to verify which version-specific changes have already been applied
    to the playerbot configuration. The returned list can be used to determine if
    additional migrations are required or to track the current state of the migration
    process. This functionality supports the playerbot system's ability to automatically
    update and adapt to new features or changes in the TrinityCore codebase without
    manual intervention.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing the identifiers of all applied migrations.
    Each string represents a unique migration identifier that has been processed and
    completed successfully by the PlayerbotMigrationMgr.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Applied Migrations
    code: "std::vector<std::string> appliedMigrations = sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->GetAppliedMigrations();\n\
      for (const auto& migration : appliedMigrations)\n{\n    LOG_INFO(\"playerbots\"\
      , \"Applied migration: {}\", migration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when checking the
    migration status of playerbot configurations. The returned vector may be empty
    if no migrations have been applied yet, or it may contain multiple entries if
    several updates have been processed. The method does not perform any side effects
    and is read-only in nature.
