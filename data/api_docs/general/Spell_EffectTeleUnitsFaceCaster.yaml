  brief: Teleports units to face the caster
  description: This method performs a teleportation operation that moves units to
    face the caster's orientation, typically used in spell effects where the target
    needs to be positioned relative to the caster. The method ensures that the unit's
    facing direction is set correctly after teleportation, which is essential for
    maintaining proper game mechanics and positioning during combat scenarios.

    effect needs to be applied to units. It requires the caster to have valid orientation
    data and may involve internal calculations for positioning.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect positioning or facing
    direction, potentially causing issues with combat mechanics or player movement
    in World of Warcraft.
