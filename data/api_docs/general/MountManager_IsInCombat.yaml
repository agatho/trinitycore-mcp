  signature: bool MountManager::IsInCombat(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is currently in combat.
  description: The IsInCombat method determines whether a specified player character
    is currently engaged in combat. This method evaluates the player's current combat
    state, including whether they are attacking or being attacked, and returns true
    if any combat activity is detected. The method is typically used by mount systems
    and other game mechanics that need to prevent certain actions while a player is
    in combat. It may also consider factors such as recent combat events or temporary
    combat states that persist after an attack has ended.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's combat state should be checked.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is currently in combat, false otherwise.
    The method will return false if the player is not found or if they are not actively
    engaged in combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is in combat
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool isInCombat = mountManager.IsInCombat(&playerId);\n\
      if (isInCombat) {\n    // Player is in combat, prevent mounting\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You cannot mount while in combat.\");\n} else {\n    // Player is not in combat,\
      \ allow mounting\n    MountPlayer(playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal player state tracking to determine combat
    status. It may not immediately reflect changes in combat status due to potential
    caching or delay in state updates. The method assumes that the player ID passed
    is valid and corresponds to an existing player character in the game world.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in time-sensitive contexts, as combat
    states can change rapidly during active combat. Ensure that the player pointer
    is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
