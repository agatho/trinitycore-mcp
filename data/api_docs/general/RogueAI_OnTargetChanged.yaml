  class: RogueAI
  method: OnTargetChanged
  signature: void RogueAI::OnTargetChanged(int * newTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the rogue AI's target reference when the current target changes
  description: The OnTargetChanged method is invoked by the RogueAI class to handle
    transitions between different targets. This method is typically called when a
    rogue's target is lost, switched, or otherwise modified during combat. It allows
    the AI to react appropriately to target changes, potentially updating internal
    state, resetting abilities, or recalculating combat behavior. The method serves
    as a key hook in the AI's decision-making loop, ensuring that the rogue responds
    correctly to dynamic battlefield conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: newTarget
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the new target's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter may be null if no target is present.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Change Handling
    code: "void RogueAI::OnTargetChanged(int* newTarget)\n{\n    if (newTarget !=\
      \ nullptr)\n    {\n        m_currentTarget = *newTarget;\n        // Reset combat\
      \ abilities\n        m_comboPoints = 0;\n        m_nextAbility = ABILITY_NONE;\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_currentTarget = 0;\n        // Handle target\
      \ loss\n        m_isInCombat = false;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI's main update loop or
    as a result of combat events. It should be implemented to handle both valid and
    null target pointers gracefully. The implementation may involve resetting ability
    cooldowns, updating threat tables, or modifying behavior based on the new target.
  warnings: Ensure that the newTarget pointer is properly validated before dereferencing
    it. Improper handling of a null pointer can lead to crashes or undefined behavior
    in combat situations.
