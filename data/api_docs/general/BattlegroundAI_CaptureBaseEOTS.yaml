documentation:
  brief: Captures the base at end of time in battleground
  description: The CaptureBaseEOTS method is responsible for handling the capture
    of a base during a battleground scenario when time has expired. This method typically
    manages the transition of control over a contested base from one faction to another
    upon the conclusion of a timed objective phase. It may involve updating game state,
    awarding points, triggering visual effects, and notifying players of the change
    in control. The method is usually invoked as part of the battleground's AI logic
    during the final moments of a capture event.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the base was successfully captured and false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether the capture operation completed without errors
    or was prevented by game conditions such as insufficient players or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground AI
    code: "if (bgAI->CaptureBaseEOTS(nullptr)) {\n    // Base captured successfully\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_CAPTURED_ALLIANCE, \"Base Name\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battleground AI system
    during time-based capture events. It assumes that all necessary preconditions
    for base capture have been validated prior to invocation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method outside of the intended battleground context
    may lead to inconsistent game state or unexpected behavior. Ensure proper synchronization
    when calling from multiple threads.
