  class: SoloCombatStrategy
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool SoloCombatStrategy::IsActive(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the solo combat strategy is currently active for the specified
    bot AI instance.
  description: The IsActive method evaluates if the current SoloCombatStrategy is
    applicable and active for a given BotAI instance. This method typically checks
    various conditions such as player state, combat status, environment factors, or
    strategy-specific flags to determine if the strategy should be engaged. It serves
    as a decision point in the AI's strategy selection process, ensuring that only
    appropriate strategies are executed at any given time. The method is commonly
    used within the TrinityCore bot AI framework to manage behavior switching based
    on game state and context.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the solo combat strategy is currently active and applicable
    for the provided BotAI instance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Strategy Evaluation
    code: "if (strategy->IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Execute solo combat actions\n   \
      \ ai->ExecuteStrategy(\"solo_combat\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Logic
    code: "class MyBotAI : public BotAI {\npublic:\n    void Update() override {\n\
      \        if (soloCombatStrategy.IsActive(this)) {\n            // Perform solo\
      \ combat logic\n            HandleSoloCombat();\n        } else {\n        \
      \    // Fall back to other strategies\n            HandleDefaultBehavior();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    should be considered. It may internally access or modify AI state variables and
    should not be used in contexts where thread safety is a concern without proper
    synchronization.
  warnings: This method relies on the internal state of the BotAI object. Calling
    it with an uninitialized or improperly configured AI instance may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the AI has been properly initialized before invoking this
    method.
