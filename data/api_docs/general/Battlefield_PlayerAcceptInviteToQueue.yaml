  method: PlayerAcceptInviteToQueue
  signature: void Battlefield::PlayerAcceptInviteToQueue(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a player's acceptance of a battlefield queue invitation.
  description: The PlayerAcceptInviteToQueue method handles the logic when a player
    accepts an invitation to join a battlefield queue. This typically occurs after
    a player has been invited to participate in a specific battlefield instance, such
    as those found in Wintergrasp or other world PvP zones. The method validates the
    player's eligibility, checks if they are already queued for another battlefield,
    and proceeds to add them to the appropriate queue. It also manages any necessary
    state changes in the battlefield system and may trigger notifications or updates
    to the player's UI regarding their queue status.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is accepting the battlefield queue
      invitation. Must be a valid player instance, cannot be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void HandleBattlefieldInvite(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->GetMap()->IsBattleGround())\n\
      \    {\n        Battlefield* bg = static_cast<Battlefield*>(player->GetMap());\n\
      \        bg->PlayerAcceptInviteToQueue(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already received a valid battlefield
    invitation and is intended to be called from within the context of a battlefield
    or battleground system. The method may internally perform checks for player eligibility,
    such as level requirements or existing queue participation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent crashes. This method should only be invoked when the player is eligible
    and has received an actual invitation to join a battlefield queue.
