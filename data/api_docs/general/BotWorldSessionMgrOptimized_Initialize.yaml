  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the optimized bot world session manager, setting up internal
    data structures and preparing for bot session handling.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized class
    for managing bot sessions by initializing internal data structures, registering
    necessary callbacks, and ensuring all required subsystems are ready. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when the bot system is enabled. It
    sets up session tracking mechanisms, configures memory pools for efficient session
    allocation, and ensures thread-safe operations are in place. The initialization
    process may also involve loading configuration settings specific to bot behavior
    and establishing connections to necessary game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized* sessionManager = new BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized();

      sessionManager->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of the object.
    Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method
    is designed to be thread-safe and can be safely called from any thread context.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can cause memory
    leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that all bot sessions are properly
    terminated before calling this method again.
