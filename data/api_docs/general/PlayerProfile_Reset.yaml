documentation:
  brief: Resets the player profile to its default state, clearing all customizations
    and restoring base settings.
  description: The Reset method clears all customizations and modifications made to
    a player's profile, returning it to its original default state. This includes
    resetting any saved preferences, achievements, or character-specific data that
    may have been altered during gameplay. The operation is typically used when a
    player wants to start fresh with their character or when system maintenance requires
    profile restoration. This method does not affect the core player data such as
    account information, character name, or basic stats, but rather focuses on profile-specific
    settings and customizations.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it permanently removes all customizations
    from the profile. It is recommended to confirm with the player before invoking
    this method, especially in scenarios where profile data might be valuable or irreplaceable.
  warnings: Invoking Reset will permanently delete any saved customizations and settings
    within the player profile. This action cannot be undone without a backup of the
    original profile state.
