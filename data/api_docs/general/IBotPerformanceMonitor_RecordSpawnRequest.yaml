documentation:
  brief: Records a spawn request event for performance monitoring purposes.
  description: The RecordSpawnRequest method is used to log and track spawn requests
    within the TrinityCore AI bot system. This method is typically invoked when a
    bot attempts to spawn or respawn in the game world, allowing the performance monitor
    to collect data on spawn frequency, timing, and resource usage. The recorded information
    helps developers analyze bot behavior patterns and optimize spawn mechanics for
    better server performance. This method does not require any parameters and performs
    no direct actions beyond logging the event.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Logic
    code: "void BotAI::OnSpawnRequest()\n{\n    sBotPerformanceMonitor->RecordSpawnRequest();\n\
      \    // Additional spawn logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within bot AI logic or spawn-related
    systems. It's important to note that this method only records the event and does
    not perform any actual spawning operations. The monitoring data collected may
    be used for debugging, performance analysis, or in-game statistics tracking.
