  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateDemonHunterAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a Demon Hunter AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateDemonHunterAI method is responsible for instantiating and
    configuring a specialized AI behavior tailored for Demon Hunter class bots within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method likely allocates memory for a Demon Hunter-specific
    AI instance, sets up appropriate combat strategies, ability usage patterns, and
    resource management routines that align with the Demon Hunter's unique mechanics
    such as Fury generation, Soul Fragments, and abilities like Eye Beam, Fel Rush,
    and Darkness. The method may also handle initial state setup, including pet management,
    cooldown tracking, and positioning logic specific to Demon Hunter gameplay. It
    is typically invoked when a bot player selects or switches to the Demon Hunter
    class for automated gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the success status of AI creation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero values
    may denote various error conditions such as invalid player reference, unsupported
    class, or allocation failures. The exact meaning of different return codes should
    be verified against the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Demon Hunter AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume a valid bot player object\nint result = factory->CreateDemonHunterAI(bot);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for the Demon Hunter bot\n\
      \    printf(\"Demon Hunter AI created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to create Demon Hunter AI with code:\
      \ %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system which extends standard TrinityCore
    AI capabilities. The implementation likely involves dynamic allocation of AI behavior
    objects and integration with existing bot management systems. Developers should
    ensure that the Player object passed to this method is valid and properly initialized
    before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-Demon Hunter player may result in undefined
    behavior or failure. Ensure that the bot player's class is confirmed to be Demon
    Hunter before invoking this method. Additionally, improper handling of return
    values could lead to runtime errors or inconsistent AI states.
