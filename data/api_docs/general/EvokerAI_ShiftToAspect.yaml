  class: EvokerAI
  method: ShiftToAspect
  signature: void EvokerAI::ShiftToAspect(EvokerAspect aspect)
documentation:
  brief: Changes the evoker's current aspect to the specified aspect.
  description: The ShiftToAspect method is used to transition an evoker AI character
    from its current aspect to a new specified aspect. This method is typically invoked
    during combat or strategic decision-making to switch between different evoker
    aspects such as Aspect of the Turtle, Aspect of the Eagle, etc. The method handles
    the internal state changes required for the aspect transition and may trigger
    associated visual effects or gameplay mechanics related to the new aspect. It
    is important that this method be called only when the evoker is in a valid state
    to change aspects, typically during combat or when the AI has determined a strategic
    shift is necessary.
  parameters:
  - name: aspect
    description: The EvokerAspect enum value representing the desired aspect to transition
      to. Valid values include aspects such as EVOKER_ASPECT_TURTLE, EVOKER_ASPECT_EAGLE,
      etc., depending on the game's implementation and available evoker aspects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aspect Shift
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->ShiftToAspect(EVOKER_ASPECT_EAGLE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Aspect Switching
    code: "if (evoker->GetCurrentAspect() != EVOKER_ASPECT_TURTLE)\n{\n    evoker->ShiftToAspect(EVOKER_ASPECT_TURTLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state updates and may involve cooldowns
    or resource checks before allowing an aspect change. It is recommended to verify
    the evoker's current state before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling ShiftToAspect without verifying that the evoker is in a valid
    state (e.g., not stunned, rooted, or otherwise incapacitated) may result in undefined
    behavior or failed transitions. Additionally, ensure that the EvokerAspect enum
    values passed are valid and supported by the current game version.
