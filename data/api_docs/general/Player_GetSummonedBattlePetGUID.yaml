documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the player's summoned battle pet
  description: This method retrieves the GUID of the battle pet currently summoned
    by the player. The GUID represents a unique identifier within the game world that
    distinguishes the pet from other pets. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with battle pet mechanics and can be essential for tracking pet ownership or performing
    actions related to the pet's state. It returns an integer value representing the
    GUID, which may be zero if no pet is currently summoned.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the summoned battle pet. A
    value of 0 indicates that no battle pet is currently summoned, while non-zero
    values represent a valid GUID for the summoned pet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int petGUID = player->GetSummonedBattlePetGUID();\nif (petGUID != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Pet is currently summoned\n    // Do something with the GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battle pet system and should be used in context
    with other battle pet related functions. The GUID returned by this method may
    vary depending on the player's current battle pet state and can change when a
    new pet is summoned or when the pet is dismissed.
  warnings: Be aware that this method will return 0 if no battle pet is currently
    summoned, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about pet ownership. Always
    verify the pet's existence before using this GUID for actions.
