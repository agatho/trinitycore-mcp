  class: KitingManager
  method: UpdateKiting
  signature: void KitingManager::UpdateKiting(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the kiting state for all players in the manager's tracking list.
  description: The UpdateKiting method is responsible for processing and updating
    the kiting behavior of players managed by this KitingManager instance. It typically
    handles movement adjustments, threat management, and AI decision-making related
    to kiting mechanics. This method is called periodically by the game loop with
    a time delta parameter to ensure timely updates. The implementation likely evaluates
    player positions, target states, and environmental factors to determine appropriate
    kiting actions such as maintaining distance or adjusting movement patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. Used to calculate
      time-based movements and cooldowns for kiting behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateKiting Usage
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    kitingManager.UpdateKiting(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Updates
    code: "class PlayerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n     \
      \   // Handle player AI logic\n        kitingManager.UpdateKiting(diff);\n \
      \       // Continue with other updates\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to maintain
    accurate kiting behavior. The diff parameter is crucial for time-based calculations
    and ensures consistent movement regardless of frame rate fluctuations.
