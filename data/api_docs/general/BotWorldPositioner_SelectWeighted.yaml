documentation:
  brief: Selects a weighted zone choice from a list of candidates based on configured
    weights.
  description: The SelectWeighted method performs a weighted random selection among
    available zone choices, typically used in AI pathfinding or bot behavior logic
    within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates the provided candidate zones and
    applies internal weighting mechanisms to determine the most suitable zone for
    the current context. This method is commonly utilized in world positioner systems
    where bots need to make decisions about which area to navigate toward based on
    various factors such as threat level, loot distribution, or player proximity.
    The method assumes that candidates have already been preprocessed and weighted
    according to game-specific rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a ZoneChoice object representing the selected zone based on weighted
    probability. The ZoneChoice contains information about the chosen area including
    its ID, coordinates, and other relevant metadata used for navigation or decision-making.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SelectWeighted
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      int candidates = 5;

      ZoneChoice selected = positioner.SelectWeighted(candidates);

      // Process the selected zone choice

      std::cout << "Selected zone ID: " << selected.GetZoneId() << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state and configuration data that may affect
    how weights are applied. It should only be called after the candidate zones have
    been properly initialized and weighted. The implementation uses a pseudo-random
    number generator for selection, so results may vary between calls unless seeded
    consistently.
  warnings: Ensure that the input candidates parameter is valid and non-negative before
    calling this method, as negative values could lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    be aware that repeated calls without proper state management might not produce
    expected weighted distribution if internal randomization isn't handled correctly.
