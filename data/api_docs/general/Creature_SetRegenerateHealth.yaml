documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature regenerates health.
  description: This method controls the creature's health regeneration behavior, determining
    whether the creature will automatically regenerate health over time. When set
    to true, the creature will regenerate health according to its defined regeneration
    rate; when set to false, health regeneration is disabled. This setting affects
    the creature's behavior during combat and non-combat situations, particularly
    influencing how often it regenerates health in the absence of damage or other
    triggers.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetRegenerateHealth(true);

      // Creature will now regenerate health

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's internal regeneration logic and
    may influence performance if used frequently. The setting is typically applied
    during creature initialization or when changing behavior dynamically.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected creature behavior,
    especially in combat situations where health regeneration is expected to occur.
    Ensure that all changes are properly tested in game context.
