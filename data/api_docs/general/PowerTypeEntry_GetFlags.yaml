  signature: int PowerTypeEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with this power type entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of a specific power type in
    the game. These flags are typically used to determine how a power type behaves
    within the game mechanics, such as whether it can be displayed on the player's
    UI, if it supports regen, or if it has special interaction rules. The returned
    value is a combination of predefined flag constants that can be checked using
    bitwise operations. This method is commonly used in conjunction with other power
    type data to configure character abilities and resource management systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask flags for this power type entry. Each
    bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific property or behavior of the
    power type, such as display settings, regeneration properties, or interaction
    rules. The exact meaning of each flag bit depends on the game's internal definitions
    and should be checked against the relevant flag constants.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a power type supports regeneration
    code: "const PowerTypeEntry* entry = sPowerTypeStore.LookupEntry(POWER_MANA);\n\
      if (entry && (entry->GetFlags() & POWER_TYPE_FLAG_REGEN)) {\n    // This power\
      \ type supports regeneration\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining multiple flag checks for power type behavior
    code: "const PowerTypeEntry* entry = sPowerTypeStore.LookupEntry(POWER_RAGE);\n\
      int flags = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & POWER_TYPE_FLAG_DISPLAY) {\n   \
      \ // Display this power type in UI\n}\nif (flags & POWER_TYPE_FLAG_REGEN) {\n\
      \    // Enable regeneration for this power type\n}\nif (!(flags & POWER_TYPE_FLAG_NO_COST))\
      \ {\n    // This power type requires cost to use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined as constants in the
    TrinityCore codebase, such as POWER_TYPE_FLAG_DISPLAY, POWER_TYPE_FLAG_REGEN,
    etc. Developers should be aware that flag values may change between game versions
    and should not rely on hardcoded bit positions. The method is read-only and does
    not modify any internal state.
  warnings: The returned integer value represents a bitmask, so bitwise operations
    must be used to check individual flags rather than direct equality comparisons.
    Incorrectly interpreting the flag values can lead to unexpected behavior in power
    type handling systems.
