documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified faction entry represents a renown reputation
    faction.
  description: The IsRenownReputation method checks if a given faction entry is classified
    as a renown reputation faction within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is used to distinguish between standard reputation factions and those that are
    specifically designated for renown progression, which typically involve special
    rewards or progression mechanics in World of Warcraft. The method evaluates the
    faction's properties to determine if it qualifies for renown-based reputation
    tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified faction entry is a renown reputation faction;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Faction is Renown
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (player->GetReputationMgr().IsRenownReputation(faction))\
      \ {\n    // Handle renown faction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal faction data flags or properties to determine
    if a faction is designated for renown tracking. Developers should ensure that
    the FactionEntry pointer passed is valid and corresponds to an actual faction
    in the game database.
