documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the creature is immune to NPC interactions.
  description: This method controls whether a creature is immune to NPC-related interactions,
    such as being attacked or targeted by player characters. When applied, it prevents
    the creature from being affected by player actions that would normally trigger
    hostile behavior. This is commonly used for NPCs that should not engage in combat
    with players or for special NPCs that require specific immunity behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetImmuneToNPC(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's AI behavior and should be used
    carefully during initialization or when setting up special NPC configurations.
    The immunity state is typically set during creature creation or through specific
    event triggers.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause creatures to become unresponsive
    to player interactions or lead to unexpected behavior in combat scenarios. This
    method should not be used for general combat behavior but rather for special cases
    like boss encounters or specific NPC mechanics.
