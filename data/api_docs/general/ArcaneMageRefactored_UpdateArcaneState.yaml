documentation:
  brief: Updates the arcane state of the mage, managing spell casting and resource
    allocation.
  description: The UpdateArcaneState method is responsible for managing the internal
    arcane state of an Arcane Mage class instance. This includes handling spell casting
    mechanics, updating arcane power resources, and ensuring proper synchronization
    between arcane effects and the mage's current casting state. The method typically
    executes during each update cycle to maintain consistent arcane spell behavior
    and resource management within the TrinityCore framework. It may interact with
    other arcane-related systems such as arcane charge tracking, spell cooldowns,
    and arcane potency calculations.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually in most cases. The implementation may vary depending on
    the specific arcane spell rotation or class specialization being used.
