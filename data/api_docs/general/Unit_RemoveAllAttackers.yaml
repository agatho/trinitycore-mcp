  brief: Removes all attackers from the unit's attack list.
  description: This method clears the attacker list for the specified unit, effectively
    removing all entities that are currently attacking the unit. It is commonly used
    during combat reset scenarios or when a unit needs to be freed from its current
    attack state. The method ensures that no attacker references remain in the unit's
    internal attacker list, which helps prevent potential issues with ongoing combat
    mechanics and prevents unwanted behavior during subsequent combat interactions.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat-related methods
    to ensure proper cleanup of attacker references. It should be called before any
    new attack state is established to avoid conflicts.
