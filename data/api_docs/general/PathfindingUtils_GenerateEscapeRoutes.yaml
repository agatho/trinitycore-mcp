  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: GenerateEscapeRoutes
  signature: int PathfindingUtils::GenerateEscapeRoutes(const int & current, uint32
    routeCount, float distance)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a set of escape routes from a given location using pathfinding
    algorithms.
  description: The GenerateEscapeRoutes method computes and returns a collection of
    possible escape routes from a specified current position. It utilizes internal
    pathfinding logic to determine viable paths that move away from the provided location,
    considering distance constraints and navigation mesh data. This method is typically
    used in AI behavior for NPCs to find safe retreat paths when under threat or during
    combat situations. The generated routes are intended to be used by the entity's
    movement system to navigate away from danger.
  parameters:
  - name: current
    description: The current position index or identifier from which escape routes
      are calculated. This parameter represents the starting point for route generation
      and is usually a node or waypoint in the navigation mesh.
  - name: routeCount
    description: The number of distinct escape routes to generate. Specifies how many
      alternative paths should be computed from the current position, each with different
      directions or strategies.
  - name: distance
    description: The minimum distance that each generated escape route must extend
      from the current position. This ensures that the escape paths are sufficiently
      far away to provide safety from immediate threats.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid escape routes successfully
    generated. A return value of zero indicates no suitable routes were found, while
    a positive integer indicates the count of available escape paths.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for NPC Escape Pathfinding
    code: "int routeCount = 3;\nfloat escapeDistance = 10.0f;\nint generatedRoutes\
      \ = PathfindingUtils::GenerateEscapeRoutes(currentNode, routeCount, escapeDistance);\n\
      if (generatedRoutes > 0) {\n    // Proceed with using the generated routes for\
      \ NPC movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Escape Route Generation Failure
    code: "int result = PathfindingUtils::GenerateEscapeRoutes(5, 2, 15.0f);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // No escape routes available; consider alternative AI behavior\n\
      \    // e.g., flee to nearest safe zone or engage in combat\n}\nelse if (result\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Use the generated routes for movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh and pathfinding system,
    so it may return fewer routes than requested if no valid paths exist within the
    specified distance. The implementation assumes that the 'current' parameter refers
    to a valid node in the pathfinding graph. Performance can be affected by complex
    terrain or dense obstacle configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'current' parameter is a valid and accessible node in
    the navigation mesh, otherwise the method may return zero routes without error.
    Avoid calling this method too frequently during high-frequency AI updates as it
    could impact performance. The distance parameter should be chosen carefully to
    balance between safety and practicality of escape paths.
