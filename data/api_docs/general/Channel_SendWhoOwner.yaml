  class: Channel

documentation:
  brief: Sends a message to the channel owner indicating who owns the channel.
  description: The SendWhoOwner method is used within the TrinityCore WoW emulator
    to notify the owner of a channel about the identity of the player who initiated
    a specific action related to the channel. This typically occurs when a player
    attempts to perform an operation that requires ownership verification, such as
    changing channel settings or kicking members. The method ensures proper communication
    between the client and server regarding channel ownership status.

  - title: Basic Usage in Channel Management
    code: "void HandleChannelOwnerCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const std::string&\
      \ args)\n{\n    if (args.empty())\n        return;\n\n    Player* player = handler->GetPlayer();\n\
      \    Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(args, player);\n    if (!channel\
      \ || !channel->IsOwner(player))\n        return;\n\n    channel->SendWhoOwner(player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the channel management system
    when ownership verification is required. It's important to note that this method
    does not directly modify any channel state, but rather communicates ownership
    information to the relevant player.
