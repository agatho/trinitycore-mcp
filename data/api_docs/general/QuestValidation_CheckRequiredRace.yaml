  class: QuestValidation
  method: CheckRequiredRace
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckRequiredRace(const Quest * quest, Player *
    bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player meets the required race restrictions for a given quest.
  description: The CheckRequiredRace method evaluates whether a player's race aligns
    with the race requirements specified in a quest. It compares the player's race
    against the quest's allowed races and returns true if the player is permitted
    to accept or complete the quest based on racial restrictions. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring players only engage with
    quests appropriate to their character's race. The method typically integrates
    with the broader quest validation system to enforce game rules and prevent invalid
    quest interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing race requirements to be validated
      against the player
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose race will be checked against the
      quest's requirements
  returns: Returns true if the player's race meets the quest's required race criteria,
    false otherwise. If the quest has no race restrictions defined, it typically returns
    true by default.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Race Validation
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* player = ...;\
      \ // Valid player object\nbool isValid = QuestValidation::CheckRequiredRace(quest,\
      \ player);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Player can accept or complete the quest\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player meets race requirements for quest %u\", quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot proceed with this quest\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player does not meet race requirements for quest %u\", quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses the quest's required race bitmask or array and
    compares it against the player's race value. It may be called during quest acceptance,
    quest completion, or validation checks. The implementation should handle edge
    cases where quests have no race restrictions or when player races are invalid.
  warnings: Ensure that both quest and bot parameters are valid pointers before calling
    this method to avoid crashes. Race validation might not account for temporary
    race changes or transformations that could affect gameplay.
