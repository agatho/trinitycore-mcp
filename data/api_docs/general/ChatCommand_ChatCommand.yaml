documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ChatCommand instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in the TrinityCore chat system.
  description: The ChatCommand constructor initializes a new instance of the ChatCommand
    class, setting up internal data structures and default configurations required
    for handling in-game chat commands within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    ensures that all necessary member variables are properly initialized before the
    command can be processed by the game's command handler system. The initialization
    includes setting up command name, help text, access levels, and other essential
    properties needed for proper command execution and validation. This constructor
    is typically invoked when creating new command entries in the command table or
    when dynamically registering chat commands during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ChatCommand instance
    code: 'ChatCommand myCommand;

      // This creates a new ChatCommand object with default initialization

      // Ready to be registered with the command system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal command handling mechanism in TrinityCore.
    Developers should not directly instantiate ChatCommand objects unless they are
    implementing custom command registration logic. The typical usage involves using
    the provided macros or command registration functions that internally create these
    instances.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of ChatCommand objects without proper context may
    lead to undefined behavior or command system failures. Always use the recommended
    command registration methods provided by the TrinityCore API rather than calling
    this constructor directly.
