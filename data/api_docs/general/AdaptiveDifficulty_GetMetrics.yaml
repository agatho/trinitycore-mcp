documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current difficulty metrics for adaptive difficulty calculations
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a DifficultyMetrics structure containing
    key statistical data used by the adaptive difficulty system. This includes player
    count, average player level, group composition details, and other relevant factors
    that influence how difficulty scaling is calculated for encounters. The returned
    metrics are essential for dynamically adjusting encounter difficulty based on
    the player group's capabilities and characteristics. The method performs no modifications
    to internal state and is designed to be called frequently during gameplay without
    performance impact.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DifficultyMetrics object containing statistical data about the current
    player group including player count, average level, and group composition information
    used for adaptive difficulty calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DifficultyMetrics metrics = adaptiveDifficulty->GetMetrics();

      uint32 playerCount = metrics.playerCount;

      uint32 avgLevel = metrics.averageLevel;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Metrics for Difficulty Adjustment
    code: "DifficultyMetrics metrics = adaptiveDifficulty->GetMetrics();\nif (metrics.playerCount\
      \ >= 5 && metrics.averageLevel > 80)\n{\n    // Apply higher difficulty scaling\n\
      \    encounter->SetDifficultyScaling(1.5f);\n}\nelse if (metrics.playerCount\
      \ < 3)\n{\n    // Apply lower difficulty scaling\n    encounter->SetDifficultyScaling(0.7f);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned DifficultyMetrics object is a copy of the internal data, so modifications
    to it won't affect the original metrics. Performance is optimized for frequent
    calls as this method is used extensively during encounter initialization and difficulty
    recalculations.
  warnings: The returned metrics may not reflect real-time changes if the player group
    composition has recently changed. For critical gameplay decisions, consider calling
    this method after group composition updates have fully propagated through the
    system.
