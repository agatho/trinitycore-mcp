documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotWorldEntryQueue instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotWorldEntryQueue class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the queue. This
    method is automatically invoked when a BotWorldEntryQueue object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource management and prevents memory
    leaks within the TrinityCore bot system's world entry handling mechanism. The
    destructor typically handles cleanup of internal data structures such as linked
    lists, containers, or other dynamic allocations used to manage queued world entries
    for bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotWorldEntryQueue
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BotWorldEntryQueue queue;\n    // ... use the\
      \ queue ...\n    // queue is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotWorldEntryQueue pointer
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue* queue = new BotWorldEntryQueue();

      // ... use the queue ...

      delete queue; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the standard C++ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is
    Initialization) pattern. It's crucial that this method properly cleans up all
    internal resources to prevent memory leaks. The destructor should not throw exceptions
    as it's called during object destruction, and throwing from a destructor can lead
    to undefined behavior.
