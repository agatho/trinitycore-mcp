documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CombatBehaviorIntegration instance and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the CombatBehaviorIntegration class is responsible
    for releasing any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were acquired
    during the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data
    structures, such as behavior trees, AI state machines, or cached combat-related
    information. It is automatically invoked when an instance of CombatBehaviorIntegration
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system,
    this method plays a crucial role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable
    performance during creature AI updates.

  - title: Basic destruction of CombatBehaviorIntegration instance
    code: 'CombatBehaviorIntegration* behavior = new CombatBehaviorIntegration();

      // ... use the behavior object ...

      delete behavior; // Triggers ~CombatBehaviorIntegration()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The cleanup performed by
    this destructor may include releasing references to AI scripts, clearing internal
    caches, and resetting state variables.
