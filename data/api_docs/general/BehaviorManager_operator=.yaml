  brief: Moves the behavior manager's resources to another behavior manager instance
  description: The move assignment operator for BehaviorManager transfers all resources
    from the source behavior manager to the current instance, leaving the source in
    a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used to efficiently
    transfer ownership of AI behaviors and associated data without unnecessary copying.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this allows for efficient management
    of creature AI states during object lifecycle operations such as spawning, despawning,
    or reassignment to different entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current BehaviorManager instance after the move operation
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'BehaviorManager manager1;

      // ... initialize manager1 ...

      BehaviorManager manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move constructor

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in AI Context
    code: "CreatureAI* ai = creature->GetAI();\nif (ai)\n{\n    BehaviorManager newBehavior;\n\
      \    newBehavior = std::move(ai->GetBehaviorManager()); // Move assignment\n\
      \    // The old behavior manager's resources are now owned by newBehavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation, which is typically more efficient
    than copy operations. The source object after the move should not be used in any
    way that requires valid state. The implementation likely involves transferring
    pointers or handles to underlying AI data structures rather than deep copying.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source BehaviorManager object should
    not be accessed as its state is undefined. Using it afterward may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. This is a standard move semantics pattern and follows RAII
    principles for resource management.
