documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given spell ID corresponds to a finisher ability for
    the rogue class.
  description: The IsFinisher method evaluates whether the specified spell ID represents
    a finisher ability within the Rogue class mechanics. Finishers are high-damage
    abilities that typically require specific conditions or combo points to be executed.
    This method is used internally by the RogueAI system to identify and handle finisher
    spells appropriately during combat decision-making processes. The method does
    not validate if the spell is actually available or usable, but rather checks against
    a predefined list of known finisher abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided spell ID corresponds to a rogue finisher ability;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Spell is a Finisher
    code: "if (rogueAI->IsFinisher(2098)) {\n    // Handle finisher logic\n    //\
      \ 2098 is the spell ID for Eviscerate\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on an internal lookup table or list of known rogue
    finisher spell IDs. The implementation may be updated with new content or balance
    changes in future patches. This check is typically performed during AI decision-making
    to determine optimal combat actions.
