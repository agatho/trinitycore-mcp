  class: AuctionHouseMgr
  method: GetCommodityAuctionDeposit
  signature: uint64 AuctionHouseMgr::GetCommodityAuctionDeposit(const int * item,
    int time, uint32 quantity)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the auction deposit required for a commodity item listed on the
    auction house.
  description: The GetCommodityAuctionDeposit method computes the required bid deposit
    amount for placing a commodity item (such as a currency or trade good) on the
    auction house. This deposit is refundable upon successful sale or removal of the
    auction. The calculation takes into account the item's base value, the auction
    duration, and the quantity being auctioned. This method is typically invoked when
    preparing to list an item for auction to determine how much gold the player must
    pay upfront as a security deposit.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the commodity item's properties,
      including its ID and other relevant metadata. The exact structure is determined
      by the internal auction house system.
  - name: time
    description: The auction duration in seconds. Valid values are typically 1 hour
      (3600), 2 hours (7200), or 12 hours (43200).
  - name: quantity
    description: The number of items being auctioned. Must be a positive integer greater
      than zero.
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the total gold amount required as an
    auction deposit for the specified commodity item, duration, and quantity.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Deposit for 100 Gold Coins
    code: 'int itemData[] = {51397, 0}; // Example commodity item ID

      uint64 deposit = auctionHouseMgr->GetCommodityAuctionDeposit(itemData, 3600,
      100);

      // Returns the deposit amount for listing 100 gold coins on a 1-hour auction'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate Deposit for Rare Trade Goods
    code: 'int itemData[] = {12345, 0}; // Example rare trade good ID

      uint64 deposit = auctionHouseMgr->GetCommodityAuctionDeposit(itemData, 43200,
      1);

      // Returns the deposit amount for listing one rare trade good on a 12-hour auction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core auction house logic and interacts with internal
    item and pricing systems. It may be called multiple times during an auction creation
    process to validate deposit amounts before finalizing the listing.
  warnings: Ensure that the item pointer points to valid data, as invalid or null
    pointers can lead to undefined behavior. The time parameter must match one of
    the supported auction durations; otherwise, the result may not reflect correct
    pricing.
