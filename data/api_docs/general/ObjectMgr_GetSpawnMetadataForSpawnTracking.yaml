documentation:
  brief: Retrieves spawn tracking metadata associated with a given spawn tracking
    identifier.
  description: The GetSpawnMetadataForSpawnTracking method retrieves metadata information
    linked to a specific spawn tracking ID. This functionality is typically used within
    TrinityCore's object management system to track and manage the spawning behavior
    of game entities such as creatures or game objects. The method likely accesses
    internal data structures that store spawn-related metadata, which may include
    spawn timers, respawn conditions, or other tracking attributes. It is designed
    to be a read-only operation that provides contextual information about how a particular
    spawn instance should behave within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the metadata associated with the
    specified spawn tracking ID. The exact meaning of this integer depends on the
    internal implementation, but it typically encodes information such as respawn
    timers, spawn conditions, or other behavioral flags that control how the tracked
    entity behaves in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spawn Metadata for Tracking
    code: "int metadata = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnMetadataForSpawnTracking(12345);\nif\
      \ (metadata > 0)\n{\n    // Process the spawn metadata\n    printf(\"Spawn metadata:\
      \ %d\\n\", metadata);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing dynamic spawns
    in World of Warcraft. It may be used internally by the server to determine when
    and how entities should respawn, or to track spawn-related events. The method
    signature suggests it's a const function, implying thread-safe access to metadata.
  warnings: The returned integer value must be interpreted according to the internal
    metadata format used by TrinityCore. Incorrect interpretation of this value could
    lead to unexpected behavior in spawn tracking logic. Ensure that the spawnTrackingId
    parameter is valid before calling this method.
