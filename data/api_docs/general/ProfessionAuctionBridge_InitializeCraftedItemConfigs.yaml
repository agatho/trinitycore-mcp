  brief: Initializes crafted item configurations for the profession auction bridge
    system
  description: This method sets up and loads all necessary configuration data for
    crafted items within the profession auction system. It prepares internal data
    structures that map crafted item templates to their auction properties, including
    pricing rules, auction durations, and item restrictions. The method is typically
    called during server initialization or when the auction house system is being
    set up to ensure all crafted items are properly configured for bidding and selling.
    This initialization process ensures that crafted items can be correctly displayed,
    priced, and managed within the auction interface.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ProfessionAuctionBridge* bridge = sObjectMgr->GetProfessionAuctionBridge();

      bridge->InitializeCraftedItemConfigs();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. It performs
    heavy data loading operations and may block the main thread temporarily. The configurations
    loaded by this method are cached for performance reasons and do not need to be
    reloaded unless configuration files change.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate configurations. Ensure that any existing configurations
    are properly cleared before calling this method again.
