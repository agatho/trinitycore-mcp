  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: CreateBotSession
  signature: std::shared_ptr<BotSession> BotSessionFactory::CreateBotSession(uint32
    accountId, int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new bot session instance for the specified account
    and character.
  description: The CreateBotSession method is responsible for instantiating a new
    BotSession object that represents a bot player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method takes an account identifier and a character GUID to associate the
    session with a specific user account and in-game character. The returned shared
    pointer manages the lifetime of the bot session, ensuring proper resource cleanup
    when no longer referenced. This functionality is essential for managing automated
    player behavior in bot systems, particularly in scenarios involving multiple accounts
    or characters controlled by bots.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account to which the bot session belongs.
      Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  - name: characterGuid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the character associated with this bot
      session. A value of -1 typically indicates no specific character is assigned.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<BotSession> pointing to the newly created bot session
    instance. Returns nullptr if the creation fails due to invalid parameters or internal
    errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Session Creation
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint characterGuid = 67890;\nstd::shared_ptr<BotSession>\
      \ session = factory->CreateBotSession(accountId, characterGuid);\nif (session)\n\
      {\n    // Use the bot session\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Session Without Specific Character
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nstd::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = factory->CreateBotSession(accountId,\
      \ -1);\nif (session)\n{\n    // Session created for account but not tied to\
      \ a specific character\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the provided accountId and characterGuid are valid
    and exist in the database. The returned BotSession object will be initialized
    with default settings unless further configuration is performed. This method may
    throw exceptions or return nullptr if the underlying resources cannot be allocated.
  warnings: Passing invalid account IDs or character GUIDs can lead to undefined behavior
    or failed session creation. Always validate input parameters before calling this
    method, especially when dealing with user-provided data.
