documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the movement speed of a player based on kiting mechanics and game
    state conditions.
  description: The AdjustMovementSpeed method modifies a player's current movement
    speed to reflect kiting behavior within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    is typically invoked during movement updates to ensure that players maintain appropriate
    speeds while engaging in combat or evasive maneuvers. It considers factors such
    as player state, combat status, and environmental conditions to dynamically adjust
    speed. The method does not return any value but directly modifies internal movement
    parameters of the associated player object.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Movement Update
    code: "void Player::UpdateMovement()\n{\n    // ... other movement logic ...\n\
      \    kitingManager.AdjustMovementSpeed();\n    // ... continue with updated\
      \ speed ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the kiting system and may be called frequently during
    player movement updates. It relies on accurate internal state tracking to determine
    appropriate speed adjustments.
