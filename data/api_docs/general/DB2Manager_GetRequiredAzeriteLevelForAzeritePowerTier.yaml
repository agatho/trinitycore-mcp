    azeriteUnlockSetId, ItemContext context, uint32 tier) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the required Azerite level needed to unlock a specific Azerite
    power tier within an Azerite unlock set.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum Azerite level required to unlock
    a given tier of Azerite powers for a specified Azerite unlock set and item context.
    It is used in the game's Azerite system to determine progression requirements
    for Azerite traits and abilities. The method takes into account both the Azerite
    unlock set ID, which identifies the specific set of Azerite powers, and the item
    context, which defines where or how the Azerite is applied (e.g., weapon, armor).
    The tier parameter specifies which tier of the power set to query for. This information
    is essential for enforcing game mechanics related to Azerite progression and ensuring
    players meet prerequisites before accessing higher-tier abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: azeriteUnlockSetId
    description: The unique identifier for an Azerite unlock set, which defines a
      specific group of Azerite powers that can be unlocked. Each item or item type
      may have its own unlock set.
  - name: context
    description: The item context indicating where the Azerite is applied (e.g., weapon,
      chest piece). This affects which Azerite powers are available and their unlock
      requirements.
  - name: tier
    description: The tier number of the Azerite power to query. Tiers typically correspond
      to different levels or stages of Azerite power unlocking, with higher tiers
      requiring more Azerite level.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the minimum required Azerite level needed
    to unlock the specified tier of the given Azerite unlock set in the provided context.
    If no data is found for the combination of parameters, it may return 0 or an appropriate
    default value depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Get Required Level for Tier 3 of Azerite Unlock Set
    code: uint32 requiredLevel = sDB2Manager->GetRequiredAzeriteLevelForAzeritePowerTier(1234,
      ITEM_CONTEXT_NORMAL, 3);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Unlock Requirement for Weapon Azerite Tier
    code: "uint32 level = sDB2Manager->GetRequiredAzeriteLevelForAzeritePowerTier(5678,\
      \ ITEM_CONTEXT_WEAPON, 5);\nif (level > player->GetAzeriteLevel()) {\n    //\
      \ Player does not meet the required Azerite level\n    SendNotification(\"You\
      \ need at least %u Azerite level to unlock this power.\", level);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal DB2 data tables that define Azerite unlock
    sets and their associated tier requirements. It's expected to be called during
    gameplay logic, particularly when checking if a player can access higher-tier
    Azerite powers or abilities. The implementation likely caches or indexes these
    values for performance.
  warnings: Ensure the provided parameters are valid before calling this method, as
    invalid IDs or contexts may lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior. Also,
    be aware that this function is part of the core DB2 manager and should not be
    called during critical sections where database consistency is paramount.
