  class: FormationManager
  method: CalculateFormationRadius
  signature: float FormationManager::CalculateFormationRadius()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the formation radius used for group positioning in
    combat.
  description: The CalculateFormationRadius method determines the optimal distance
    at which units should maintain their position relative to each other within a
    group or formation. This value is crucial for AI behavior, particularly when managing
    mob formations, player group positioning, and maintaining tactical spacing during
    combat encounters. The calculation typically considers factors such as unit size,
    movement speed, and combat engagement range. The method does not accept any parameters
    and returns a floating-point value representing the radius in yards.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated formation radius in yards. This
    value indicates the distance units should maintain from their formation center
    during group activities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float radius = formationManager.CalculateFormationRadius();\n// Use radius\
      \ to set positioning for group members\nif (radius > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Apply\
      \ formation spacing logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during formation initialization or when unit
    positioning needs to be recalculated based on dynamic conditions such as movement
    speed changes or combat state transitions. The result may vary depending on the
    specific implementation of the FormationManager class and its associated AI logic.
