  brief: Moves the contents of another RBACData object to this object, leaving the
    source in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The move assignment operator for RBACData transfers all resources from
    the right-hand side RBACData object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used to efficiently transfer ownership of data without performing deep copies.
    After the move, the source object will be left in a valid but unspecified state,
    meaning it can still be safely destroyed or assigned to, but its contents are
    not guaranteed to be in any particular form. In the context of TrinityCore's RBAC
    (Role-Based Access Control) system, this method allows for efficient management
    of permission data structures during object lifecycle operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current RBACData object, allowing for chaining of assignment
    operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'RBACData data1;

      RBACData data2 = std::move(data1); // Move-assigns data1 to data2

      // data1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'RBACData data1, data2, data3;

      // ... populate data1 and data2 ...

      data3 = std::move(data1); // Move-assign to data3

      data3 = std::move(data2); // Move-assign again

      // data1 and data2 are now in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics standard and should be used
    when transferring ownership of resources. It's particularly useful for performance
    optimization in scenarios where objects are frequently moved rather than copied,
    such as in containers or during function returns. The implementation assumes that
    the source object remains destructible after the move operation.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object should not be used in any way
    that relies on its previous state, as it's left in a valid but unspecified state.
    Attempting to use the moved-from object for operations that require its original
    contents will result in undefined behavior.
