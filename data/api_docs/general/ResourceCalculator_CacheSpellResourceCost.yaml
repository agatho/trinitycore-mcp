  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: CacheSpellResourceCost
  signature: void ResourceCalculator::CacheSpellResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Caches the resource cost of a specified spell for efficient lookup during
    spell casting.
  description: The CacheSpellResourceCost method stores the resource requirements
    (such as mana, rage, or energy) associated with a given spell ID in an internal
    cache. This allows the game engine to quickly retrieve resource costs without
    repeatedly querying the database or performing expensive calculations. The caching
    mechanism is typically invoked during spell initialization or loading phases to
    ensure that resource data is readily available when players cast spells. This
    method does not validate the existence of the spell ID, so it's expected that
    the caller ensures the spell ID is valid before invoking this function.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Caching Resource Cost for a Spell
    code: 'ResourceCalculator calculator;

      calculator.CacheSpellResourceCost(12345); // Caches the resource cost for spell
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an internal caching system designed to improve performance
    during spell casting. The cache should be invalidated or updated if spell resource
    costs are modified dynamically during runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect resource cost lookups. Ensure that the spell ID exists in the game's
    spell database before calling this function.
