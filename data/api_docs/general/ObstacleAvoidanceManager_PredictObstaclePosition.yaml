  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: PredictObstaclePosition
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::PredictObstaclePosition(const ObstacleInfo
    & obstacle, float timeAhead)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the future position of an obstacle based on its current state and
    time ahead.
  description: The PredictObstaclePosition method calculates where an obstacle will
    be located at a specified time in the future, using its current position, velocity,
    and other movement attributes. This functionality is crucial for AI pathfinding
    and avoidance behaviors in TrinityCore's navigation system. The method takes into
    account the obstacle's movement pattern to determine its projected location, which
    helps units avoid collisions. It requires valid obstacle data and a positive time
    value to produce meaningful results.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: Reference to an ObstacleInfo structure containing current obstacle
      properties such as position, velocity, and movement characteristics.
  - name: timeAhead
    description: Float value representing the time duration (in seconds) ahead to
      predict the obstacle's position. Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns an integer status code indicating success or failure of the prediction
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values
    may indicate invalid input parameters or calculation errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle position prediction
    code: "ObstacleInfo obs;\nobs.position = {10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f};\nobs.velocity\
      \ = {1.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f};\nint result = obstacleManager.PredictObstaclePosition(obs,\
      \ 2.5f);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Prediction successful\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using prediction for AI path avoidance
    code: "float timeToPredict = 3.0f;\nObstacleInfo currentObstacle;\n// ... populate\
      \ obstacle data ...\nint predictionStatus = obstacleManager.PredictObstaclePosition(currentObstacle,\
      \ timeToPredict);\nif (predictionStatus == 0) {\n    // Proceed with pathfinding\
      \ using predicted position\n    // to avoid collision\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI obstacle avoidance system and relies on accurate
    obstacle state data. The prediction accuracy depends on the fidelity of the input
    ObstacleInfo structure, particularly velocity and movement direction. Performance
    may be impacted by frequent calls with many obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure that the ObstacleInfo parameter contains valid data before calling
    this method; otherwise, results may be undefined or cause errors. The timeAhead
    parameter must be positive to avoid invalid predictions. This method does not
    validate input parameters beyond basic type checking.
