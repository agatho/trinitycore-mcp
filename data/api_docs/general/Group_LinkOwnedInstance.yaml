  class: Group
  method: LinkOwnedInstance
  signature: void Group::LinkOwnedInstance(GroupInstanceReference * ref)
documentation:
  brief: Links an owned instance reference to the group, associating it with the group's
    instance management system.
  description: The LinkOwnedInstance method is used to associate a GroupInstanceReference
    object with a Group. This allows the group to manage and track ownership of specific
    instances, such as dungeons or raids, within the World of Warcraft game world.
    The method integrates the provided reference into the group's internal instance
    tracking system, ensuring that when players in the group enter or leave an instance,
    proper ownership and tracking mechanisms are maintained. This is particularly
    important for maintaining proper loot distribution, instance reset timers, and
    player tracking across shared instances. The method does not perform any validation
    on the reference itself but assumes it has been properly initialized and represents
    a valid instance relationship.
  parameters:
  - name: ref
    description: A pointer to a GroupInstanceReference object that contains the instance
      ownership data to be linked with this group. This reference must be a valid,
      initialized object representing an instance that the group should own or track.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of LinkOwnedInstance
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    GroupInstanceReference*\
      \ instanceRef = new GroupInstanceReference();\n    // Initialize instanceRef\
      \ with appropriate data\n    group->LinkOwnedInstance(instanceRef);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server when managing
    group instance ownership. It does not perform any automatic cleanup of the reference,
    so developers must ensure proper memory management. The method assumes that the
    GroupInstanceReference object passed to it has been properly initialized with
    valid data before being linked.
  warnings: This method should only be called with a properly initialized GroupInstanceReference
    object. Passing a null pointer or an uninitialized reference can lead to undefined
    behavior and potential crashes. Additionally, this method does not validate whether
    the instance referenced is actually accessible or valid for the group members.
