  signature: void BotWorldEntry::SendInitialPacketsAfterMap()
documentation:
  brief: Sends initial network packets to a bot player after they have been added
    to a map.
  description: The SendInitialPacketsAfterMap method is responsible for transmitting
    essential game data and state information to a bot player once the bot has been
    successfully added to a world map. This typically includes sending the player's
    initial position, orientation, character data, and any relevant world objects
    or environment details needed for the bot to properly render and interact within
    the game world. The method ensures that the bot client receives all necessary
    packets to establish a functional connection and visual representation in the
    game. It is generally called as part of the bot initialization sequence after
    map loading but before the bot becomes fully active.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotWorldEntry* entry = new BotWorldEntry();

      entry->SendInitialPacketsAfterMap();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore bot system
    during the process of spawning a new bot player. It assumes that the bot's map
    and associated data structures are already initialized. The method may involve
    sending multiple packets over the network, which could impact performance if called
    frequently or in bulk.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal state
    management of bot players. Improper usage can lead to incomplete packet delivery
    or client-side errors. Ensure that the bot is properly initialized before calling
    this method.
