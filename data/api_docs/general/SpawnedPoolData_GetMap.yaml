  class: SpawnedPoolData
  method: GetMap
  signature: Map * SpawnedPoolData::GetMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Map object associated with the spawned pool data.
  description: The GetMap method retrieves a pointer to the Map instance that the
    SpawnedPoolData object is associated with. This allows access to map-specific
    information and functionality, such as map dimensions, terrain data, or other
    map-related systems. The returned pointer is typically used to interact with the
    game world's map context for spawning or managing creatures, game objects, or
    other entities within a specific map area. This method does not perform any operations
    on the map itself but provides access to it for further use.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Map object associated with this SpawnedPoolData instance.
    Returns nullptr if no valid map is associated with the data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Map from SpawnedPoolData
    code: "SpawnedPoolData* poolData = ...;\nMap* map = poolData->GetMap();\nif (map)\n\
      {\n    // Use map for further operations\n    uint32 mapId = map->GetId();\n\
      \    // Process map-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Map pointer is valid only as long as the SpawnedPoolData object
    remains alive and properly initialized. This method is commonly used in spawning
    systems where pool data needs to be linked to a specific map context for proper
    positioning or zone-based operations.
