  signature: void SceneObject::RemoveFromWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the scene object from the game world, making it invisible and inactive
    to players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes a SceneObject from the active game
    world state. This operation typically involves removing the object from all relevant
    spatial partition systems, clearing its presence from player clients, and ensuring
    that it no longer participates in world updates or interactions. The object remains
    in memory but is no longer considered part of the active world simulation. This
    method is commonly used when an object needs to be temporarily or permanently
    removed from gameplay, such as during destruction, fading out, or transitioning
    between different world states.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic removal of a scene object
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = ...; // Get reference to scene object

      sceneObj->RemoveFromWorld(); // Remove from world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on objects that are currently in the world.
    Calling it on an already removed object may result in undefined behavior. The
    method typically performs cleanup operations such as removing the object from
    grid managers and notifying subsystems about the removal.
  warnings: Do not call RemoveFromWorld on objects that are already removed or destroyed,
    as this can lead to memory corruption or invalid memory access. Ensure proper
    reference counting and lifecycle management before calling this method.
