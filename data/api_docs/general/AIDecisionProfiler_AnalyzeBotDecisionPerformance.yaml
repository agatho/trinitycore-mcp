  method: AnalyzeBotDecisionPerformance
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeBotDecisionPerformance(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the performance of a bot's AI decision-making process for the specified
    GUID.
  description: The AnalyzeBotDecisionPerformance method evaluates and logs the effectiveness
    of an AI-controlled bot's decision-making behavior. It processes data related
    to the bot's choices, actions, and outcomes over time to generate performance
    metrics. This method is typically used in debugging or optimizing AI behavior
    within TrinityCore's bot system. The analysis includes evaluating reaction times,
    decision accuracy, and overall strategic effectiveness. The method requires a
    valid bot GUID to operate correctly and may trigger internal profiling mechanisms
    that collect data for further processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.AnalyzeBotDecisionPerformance(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger profiling system and may have performance
    implications when called frequently. It should only be invoked with valid bot
    GUIDs to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the bot exists and is properly initialized
    before invoking this method.
