documentation:
  brief: Deletes the charm information associated with the unit, removing any linked
    charm data.
  description: The DeleteCharmInfo method removes all charm-related data from a Unit
    object, effectively breaking the connection between the unit and its charm. This
    method is typically used when a charm needs to be removed from a creature or player,
    such as during a charm removal event or when the unit is no longer capable of
    being controlled by a player. The operation ensures that any references to the
    charm are cleared, preventing potential memory leaks or invalid access to charm
    data.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->DeleteCharmInfo();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a charm is removed from the unit, and
    it may be called as part of a larger cleanup process. It's important to note that
    this method does not destroy the charm object itself; it only removes references
    to it within the unit.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to dangling pointers or invalid memory
    access if the charm data is still referenced elsewhere after deletion. Ensure
    that all references to the charm are properly cleared before calling this method.
