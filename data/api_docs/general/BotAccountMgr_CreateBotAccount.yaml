  method: CreateBotAccount
  signature: uint32 BotAccountMgr::CreateBotAccount(const std::string & requestedEmail)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot account with the specified email address and returns its
    unique identifier.
  description: The CreateBotAccount method is responsible for generating a new bot
    account within the TrinityCore database using the provided email address. It ensures
    that the email is unique and assigns a new unique identifier (GUID) to the account.
    This method is typically used in automated systems or scripts that manage multiple
    bot accounts for testing, automation, or gameplay assistance purposes. The method
    performs validation on the input email to ensure it meets basic formatting requirements
    and uniqueness constraints within the database. It returns the GUID of the newly
    created bot account, which can then be used to reference or manipulate the account
    in subsequent operations.
  parameters:
  - name: requestedEmail
    description: The email address to be associated with the new bot account. Must
      be a valid, unique email string that follows standard email formatting conventions.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    newly created bot account. If the creation fails due to invalid input or database
    constraints, it may return 0 to indicate an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Account Creation
    code: "uint32 accountId = sBotAccountMgr->CreateBotAccount(\"bot123@example.com\"\
      );\nif (accountId != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Successfully created bot account with\
      \ ID: %u\\n\", accountId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Failed to create bot account.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Account Creation with Error Handling
    code: "std::string email = \"testbot_\" + std::to_string(time(nullptr)) + \"@example.com\"\
      ;\nuint32 newAccountId = sBotAccountMgr->CreateBotAccount(email);\nif (newAccountId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with additional bot setup using the account ID\n\
      \    printf(\"Created bot account with GUID: %u\\n\", newAccountId);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Log error or handle failure case\n    printf(\"Could not create bot\
      \ account for email: %s\\n\", email.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAccountMgr singleton is properly initialized
    and accessible. The method may perform database operations, so it's recommended
    to call it from a context where database transactions are safe. It's designed
    to be thread-safe for concurrent usage but may require locking in high-concurrency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with an already existing email address will likely
    result in failure or undefined behavior. Ensure that the email is unique before
    calling this method. Also, be aware that creating too many bot accounts rapidly
    might trigger anti-abuse measures or database performance issues.
