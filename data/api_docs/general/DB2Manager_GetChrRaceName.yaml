  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetChrRaceName
  signature: const char * DB2Manager::GetChrRaceName(uint8 race, LocaleConstant locale)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized name of a character race from the DB2 database based
    on the provided race ID and locale.
  description: The GetChrRaceName method fetches the display name of a character race
    from the DB2 database files, using the specified race ID and locale. This function
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-server communication to provide localized
    race names for player characters, NPCs, or UI elements. The method accesses internal
    DB2 data structures that contain race-related information such as names, descriptions,
    and visual properties. It requires a valid race ID (typically between 1-10 for
    Alliance races and 11-15 for Horde races) and a valid LocaleConstant to return
    the appropriate localized string. The returned pointer points to an internal static
    buffer which may be overwritten on subsequent calls.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The numeric ID representing the character race (e.g., 1 for Human,
      2 for Dwarf, etc.). Valid values typically range from 1-15, with specific IDs
      mapping to different racial types in the game.
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant specifying which language version of the name
      to return (e.g., LOCALE_en, LOCALE_fr, etc.). Must be a valid locale identifier
      supported by the server configuration.
  returns: A const char* pointer to the localized race name string. Returns NULL if
    the race ID is invalid or no data exists for the specified locale. The returned
    string is stored in an internal static buffer and should not be freed by the caller.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const char* raceName = sDB2Manager->GetChrRaceName(1, LOCALE_en);\nif (raceName)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Race Name: %s\\n\", raceName);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Character
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nuint8 raceId = player->getRace();\n\
      const char* raceName = sDB2Manager->GetChrRaceName(raceId, LOCALE_en);\nif (raceName)\n\
      {\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"Your race is: %s\"\
      , raceName);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses DB2 data files which are loaded at server startup. The
    returned string is cached in a static buffer, so multiple calls with different
    parameters will overwrite previous results. For thread safety, ensure this function
    is called from within a thread-safe context or use appropriate synchronization
    mechanisms if accessed concurrently.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free the returned pointer as it points to internal static
    memory. Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency loops due to potential
    performance impact from accessing DB2 data structures. Invalid race IDs or locales
    may return NULL without error reporting.
