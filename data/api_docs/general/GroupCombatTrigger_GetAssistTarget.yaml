documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the target unit that a bot should assist within a
    group context.
  description: The GetAssistTarget method identifies and returns the most appropriate
    target unit for a bot to assist in combat, based on group dynamics and player
    behavior. This method is typically used by AI systems to determine which enemy
    or ally requires assistance. It evaluates the current combat state, group composition,
    and player roles to select an appropriate assist target. The returned Unit pointer
    may be null if no suitable target exists or if the bot is not in a valid combat
    scenario.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit that should be assisted by the bot. Returns nullptr
    if no valid assist target is found or if the bot is not in a combat situation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "Unit* target = groupCombatTrigger->GetAssistTarget(bot, group);\nif (target\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Proceed with assisting the target\n    bot->Attack(target,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for valid assist target before action
    code: "Unit* assistTarget = groupCombatTrigger->GetAssistTarget(bot, group);\n\
      if (assistTarget && assistTarget->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Ensure the target is\
      \ alive and valid\n    bot->SetTarget(assistTarget->GetGUID());\n    bot->CastSpell(assistTarget,\
      \ 12345, true); // Example spell cast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's group management and AI
    systems to determine optimal combat behavior. It may consider factors such as
    threat levels, player roles (tank, healer, damage dealer), and proximity to the
    bot when selecting an assist target.
  warnings: The returned Unit pointer should always be checked for null before use
    to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior. In certain edge cases involving
    group disbanding or invalid combat states, this method may return nullptr unexpectedly.
