  class: QuestManager
  method: MoveToQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestManager::MoveToQuestGiver(WorldObject * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the player to the quest giver's location.
  description: The MoveToQuestGiver method initiates a movement action for the player
    character to navigate to the specified quest giver's position. This method is
    typically used within the context of quest management to ensure the player can
    interact with the quest giver object. It handles pathfinding and movement logic
    internally, ensuring smooth traversal to the destination. The method returns true
    if the movement was successfully initiated, or false if it failed due to invalid
    parameters or movement restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject representing the quest giver. This object
      must be a valid quest giver with a valid position and should not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the movement to the quest giver was successfully initiated,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid input parameters,
    movement restrictions, or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToQuestGiver
    code: "if (questManager->MoveToQuestGiver(questGiverObject)) {\n    // Movement\
      \ initiated successfully\n    // Proceed with quest interaction logic\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle movement failure\n    // Possibly notify the player or log\
      \ an error\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying movement system of TrinityCore and may
    be affected by factors such as terrain, obstacles, or player state. It is recommended
    to validate that the questGiver object is valid and accessible before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the questGiver pointer is not null before invoking this method.
    Failure to do so can result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also, be aware that
    movement may be blocked by various game mechanics such as combat state, zoning
    restrictions, or server-side limitations.
