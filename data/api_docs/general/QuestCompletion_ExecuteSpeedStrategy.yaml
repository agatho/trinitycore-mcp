    & progress)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the speed strategy for quest completion, optimizing player actions
    based on quest progress and available resources.
  description: The ExecuteSpeedStrategy method is designed to optimize a player's
    quest completion behavior by evaluating current quest progress and determining
    the most efficient path to finish objectives. This method typically manages resource
    allocation, action prioritization, and decision-making logic to minimize time
    and effort spent on quest-related activities. It interacts with the player's current
    quest data and may adjust behavior based on available items, quest requirements,
    and game state conditions. The implementation likely considers factors such as
    quest rewards, objective priorities, and player capabilities when making decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the AI-controlled character
      that will execute the speed strategy. This parameter must be a valid player
      instance with active quest data.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to QuestProgressData containing current quest progress
      information, including completed objectives, available items, and remaining
      requirements for the active quest.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteSpeedStrategy
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player instance

      QuestProgressData progress = ...; // Get current quest progress

      QuestCompletion completion;

      completion.ExecuteSpeedStrategy(player, progress);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest update handling
    code: "void OnQuestUpdate(Player* player, QuestProgressData& progress)\n{\n  \
      \  QuestCompletion completion;\n    completion.ExecuteSpeedStrategy(player,\
      \ progress);\n    // Additional logic for quest handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest progression updates or when
    the AI needs to make decisions about optimal quest completion paths. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific quest type and available resources. It's recommended
    to ensure that both parameters are valid before calling this method to prevent
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player object passed is not null and has valid quest data.
    Improper handling of quest progress data could lead to incorrect strategy execution
    or unexpected behavior in quest completion.
