  class: LfgProposal
  method: LfgProposal
  signature: void LfgProposal::LfgProposal(uint32 dungeon)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LFG proposal for the specified dungeon.
  description: The LfgProposal constructor initializes a new Looking for Group (LFG)
    proposal for the specified dungeon. This method sets up the internal state of
    the proposal object, preparing it to manage group matching and dungeon assignment
    for players seeking coordinated adventures. The dungeon parameter determines which
    specific dungeon instance this proposal will be associated with, enabling proper
    tracking of group composition and dungeon selection during LFG operations. This
    constructor is typically invoked when a player initiates an LFG search or when
    a group leader creates a proposal for a specific dungeon.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeon
    description: The unique identifier for the dungeon this LFG proposal is associated
      with. This value corresponds to the dungeon ID used internally by TrinityCore's
      LFG system, typically matching entries in the dbc files or database tables that
      define dungeon configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an LFG Proposal for a Specific Dungeon
    code: 'LfgProposal proposal(1234);

      // This creates a new LFG proposal for dungeon ID 1234 (e.g., a specific raid
      instance)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal LFG system implementation and should
    typically not be called directly by external code. The LfgProposal object is usually
    managed by the LFG manager system which handles proposal lifecycle, group matching,
    and dungeon assignment automatically.
