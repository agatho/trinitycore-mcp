documentation:
  brief: Loads localized quest offer reward text from the database into memory for
    use in the World of Warcraft client.
  description: The LoadQuestOfferRewardLocale method retrieves localized quest offer
    reward text entries from the database and stores them in an internal lookup structure.
    This allows the game to display appropriate reward descriptions based on the player's
    locale. The method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations to ensure that all localized quest data is available for active quests.
    It processes entries from the quest_offer_reward_locale table, mapping each entry
    by its quest ID and locale code to provide accurate text translations for quest
    rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::Initialize() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadQuestOfferRewardLocale();\n\
      \    // Continue with other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection is established. The loaded data is
    stored in memory for fast lookup during quest reward display operations, so performance
    is critical. This method does not directly interact with the game world state
    but prepares data structures needed by other systems.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that database connections are properly
    initialized before invoking this method. The method assumes all required database
    tables exist and contain valid data.
