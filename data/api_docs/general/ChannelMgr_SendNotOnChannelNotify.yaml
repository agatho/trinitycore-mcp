  class: ChannelMgr
  method: SendNotOnChannelNotify
  signature: void ChannelMgr::SendNotOnChannelNotify(const Player * player, const
    std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a notification to a player that they are not on the specified channel.
  description: The SendNotOnChannelNotify method is used to inform a player that they
    are attempting to perform an action on a chat channel they are not currently part
    of. This typically occurs when a player tries to send a message to a channel they
    have not joined, or when trying to leave a channel they are not in. The method
    sends a specific error message to the player's client, notifying them of their
    channel membership status. This is an internal utility function used by the ChannelMgr
    class to maintain proper channel access control and user experience.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that should receive the notification.
      Must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: name
    description: The name of the channel that the player is not on. This string represents
      the channel identifier used for the notification message.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ChannelMgr* channelMgr = sChannelMgr;

      Player* player = ...; // valid player instance

      std::string channelName = "General";

      channelMgr->SendNotOnChannelNotify(player, channelName);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Channel Management Context
    code: "void HandleChannelMessage(Player* player, std::string const& message, std::string\
      \ const& channelName)\n{\n    Channel* ch = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(channelName,\
      \ player);\n    if (!ch || !ch->HasMember(player))\n    {\n        sChannelMgr->SendNotOnChannelNotify(player,\
      \ channelName);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with sending message...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the ChannelMgr class when a
    player attempts to interact with a channel they are not a member of. The implementation
    likely sends a specific packet to the player's client that displays an error message
    in their chat interface, informing them that they are not on the requested channel.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null or invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, make
    sure the channel name string is properly formatted and does not contain unexpected
    characters that might affect client-side display.
