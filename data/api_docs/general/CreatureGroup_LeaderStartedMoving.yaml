  method: LeaderStartedMoving
  signature: void CreatureGroup::LeaderStartedMoving()
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the creature group that the leader has started moving, triggering
    group movement behavior.
  description: The LeaderStartedMoving method is invoked when a creature group's leader
    begins to move, signaling other members of the group to follow. This method typically
    handles synchronization of group movement states and ensures that all creatures
    in the group respond appropriately to the leader's actions. It is part of the
    AI system for grouped creatures and plays a key role in maintaining formation
    during movement. The method does not take any parameters and performs internal
    state updates within the creature group.

  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnLeaderStartedMoving()\n{\n    if (creatureGroup)\n\
      \        creatureGroup->LeaderStartedMoving();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core AI system when a group
    leader's movement state changes. Developers should not call this directly unless
    implementing custom group behavior logic.
