  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32
    enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the unholy death knight's AoE rotation logic for targeting multiple
    enemies
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for an unholy
    death knight's ability to perform area-of-effect attacks against multiple targets.
    This method determines optimal spell usage and resource management when facing
    groups of enemies, prioritizing damage output while maintaining efficient rune
    regeneration and cooldown management. The function takes into account the number
    of enemies present and selects appropriate abilities such as Death Coil, Scourge
    Strike, and other AoE spells to maximize damage per second in group combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an array of target identifiers for the current group of
      enemies. Each element represents a single enemy target that the death knight
      should consider for attack.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: The total number of enemies in the current combat group. This value
      determines how many targets will be processed and influences spell selection
      decisions for optimal AoE damage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: "void ExecuteAoERotation(int* targets, uint32 count) {\n    // Implementation\
      \ would iterate through targets and apply appropriate spells\n    for (uint32\
      \ i = 0; i < count; ++i) {\n        // Logic to determine which spell to cast\
      \ on each target\n        // Based on current resources and enemy positioning\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Manager
    code: "void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (IsInCombat()\
      \ && GetEnemyCount() > 1) {\n        int targets[5]; // Assuming max 5 enemies\n\
      \        uint32 count = GetNearbyEnemies(targets, 5);\n        ExecuteAoERotation(targets,\
      \ count);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the death knight has sufficient runes and energy
    to cast AoE spells. The implementation should account for movement restrictions
    and positioning requirements of certain abilities. Performance considerations
    include minimizing target selection overhead and optimizing spell casting sequences
    for maximum throughput.
  warnings: Ensure that the target array is properly initialized before calling this
    function, as invalid pointers may cause crashes. This method does not handle single-target
    scenarios - it's specifically designed for multi-enemy situations where AoE damage
    is optimal.
