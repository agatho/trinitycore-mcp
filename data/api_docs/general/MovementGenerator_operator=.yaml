documentation:
  brief: Moves a movement generator from one object to another using move assignment.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of a MovementGenerator,
    transferring ownership of resources from the source object to the target object.
    This is typically used in scenarios where a MovementGenerator needs to be reassigned
    or replaced without copying expensive internal data structures. The method ensures
    that the moved-from object is left in a valid but unspecified state. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI and movement system, this operation allows for efficient resource
    management when handling creature or player movement behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The rvalue reference to another MovementGenerator object whose resources
      will be moved to this object.
  returns: A reference to the current MovementGenerator object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'MovementGenerator generator1;

      MovementGenerator generator2 = std::move(generator1); // Uses operator=

      // generator1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<MovementGenerator> generators;

      generators.emplace_back();

      generators.emplace_back(std::move(generators[0])); // Move assignment

      // First generator is now moved to second position'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a move assignment operator in C++
    and should be used with caution when dealing with objects that manage external
    resources. The moved-from object must not be accessed after the operation unless
    reinitialized.
  warnings: Using this operator on an already moved-from object can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper initialization or reassignment of moved-from objects before
    reuse.
