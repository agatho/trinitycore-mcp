documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Shaman AI instance for a bot character
  description: The CreateShamanAI method is responsible for instantiating a new Shaman
    AI behavior controller for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the necessary game state
    variables, and configures the AI's primary abilities and spell casting routines
    specific to the Shaman class. The method typically integrates with the broader
    AI system to ensure proper bot behavior in combat, healing, and elemental spell
    management. It requires a valid bot reference pointer to be passed in order to
    properly initialize the AI context.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's unique identifier or
      memory address. This parameter is used to associate the newly created Shaman
      AI with the specific bot instance that will be controlled by this AI component.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success status of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid bot reference, memory
    allocation failure, or initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shaman AI Creation
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreateShamanAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    printf(\"Shaman AI created successfully for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create Shaman AI for bot %d with error code\
      \ %d\\n\", botId, result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Shaman AI Creation
    code: "int* botPtr = nullptr;\nint result = factory->CreateShamanAI(botPtr);\n\
      if (result != 0) {\n    switch(result) {\n        case -1: printf(\"Invalid\
      \ bot reference\\n\"); break;\n        case -2: printf(\"Memory allocation failed\\\
      n\"); break;\n        default: printf(\"Unknown error occurred\\n\"); break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and assumes that the
    bot system is properly initialized. The method may perform internal validation
    on the provided bot pointer to ensure it points to a valid bot instance before
    proceeding with AI creation. Developers should ensure that the bot parameter is
    properly allocated and initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer for the bot parameter will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. The method does not perform extensive validation
    of the bot's current state, so it's recommended to verify that the bot is in a
    valid state before calling this function. Additionally, multiple calls to this
    method on the same bot reference may lead to memory leaks or inconsistent AI states.
