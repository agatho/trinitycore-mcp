documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PerformanceOptimizer class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the PerformanceOptimizer
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the optimizer exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global performance
    optimization settings and utilities. The returned reference provides access to
    all performance-related functionality such as memory management, CPU usage monitoring,
    and resource allocation controls. This is a thread-safe implementation that guarantees
    consistent access to the singleton instance across different threads in the TrinityCore
    server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single PerformanceOptimizer instance, allowing direct
    access to all its methods and properties without requiring explicit instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Performance Optimizer Singleton
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer& optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer::Instance();

      optimizer.EnableHighPerformanceMode();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Performance Optimizer for Resource Management
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer& perf = PerformanceOptimizer::Instance();

      perf.SetMemoryLimit(1024 * 1024 * 100); // 100MB limit

      perf.StartProfiling();

      // ... performance critical code ...

      perf.StopProfiling();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the entire
    server runtime. This pattern ensures consistent performance monitoring across
    all subsystems. The implementation uses thread-local storage for internal state
    management to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Avoid storing references to the singleton instance in long-lived objects
    as this may prevent proper cleanup during server shutdown. The singleton should
    only be accessed through the Instance() method - direct instantiation is not supported.
