    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a cached path exists for the specified bot and destination.
  description: The HasCachedPath method determines whether a precomputed path exists
    in the internal cache for a given player bot and destination coordinate. This
    functionality is used to optimize pathfinding performance by avoiding redundant
    calculations when a path has already been computed and stored. The method typically
    checks against an internal data structure that maps bot-player objects and destination
    coordinates to previously calculated paths. It's commonly used before initiating
    new pathfinding operations to determine if the result can be retrieved from cache
    instead of recalculating.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which to check
      cached path existence. Must not be null.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to an integer representing the destination coordinate or
      identifier. The exact meaning depends on the implementation but typically corresponds
      to a waypoint index, map coordinate, or target position.
  returns: Returns true if a cached path exists for the specified bot and destination;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that either no path
    was previously computed for this combination or the cache entry has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for cached path
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nint destCoord = 12345;\nif (pathfinder.HasCachedPath(myBot,\
      \ destCoord)) {\n    // Use cached path\n    std::cout << \"Using cached path\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Compute new path\n    std::cout << \"Computing\
      \ new path\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with bot movement logic
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool MoveToDestination(Player* bot, int destination)\
      \ {\n        if (pathfinder.HasCachedPath(bot, destination)) {\n           \
      \ // Retrieve and use cached path\n            return UseCachedPath(bot, destination);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Compute new path and cache it\n          \
      \  auto newPath = pathfinder.CalculatePath(bot, destination);\n            pathfinder.CachePath(bot,\
      \ destination, newPath);\n            return ExecutePath(newPath);\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with a caching mechanism that
    stores computed paths to avoid redundant pathfinding computations. The cache may
    have expiration policies or size limitations that affect when entries are removed.
    Implementation details might vary depending on whether the pathfinding system
    uses grid-based coordinates, waypoint systems, or other spatial representations.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is valid and not null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Be aware that cached paths may become invalid
    due to dynamic map changes or object movement, so additional validation might
    be required in certain scenarios.
