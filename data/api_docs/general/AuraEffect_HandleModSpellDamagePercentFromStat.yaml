  method: HandleModSpellDamagePercentFromStat
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModSpellDamagePercentFromStat(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a modifier to spell damage based on a specified stat.
  description: The HandleModSpellDamagePercentFromStat method is responsible for adjusting
    spell damage percentages depending on a player's stat value, such as Intellect
    or Spirit. This method is typically invoked when an aura that modifies spell damage
    from a stat is applied or removed from a unit. It calculates the percentage increase
    or decrease in spell damage based on the stat modifier and updates the affected
    unit's spell damage accordingly. The effect is usually temporary and tied to the
    duration of the aura.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, typically indicating whether the effect is
      being applied (1) or removed (0).
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag that determines if the aura effect should be applied
      (true) or removed (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Spell Damage Modifier from Intellect
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication();

      uint8 mode = 1;

      bool apply = true;

      effect->HandleModSpellDamagePercentFromStat(app, mode, apply);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and relies
    on stat calculations defined by the game's spell system. It is expected to be
    called during aura application or removal events.
