documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot lifecycle management system
  description: The Initialize method sets up and prepares the BotLifecycleMgr for
    managing bot creation, destruction, and lifecycle events within the TrinityCore
    environment. This method performs essential setup operations such as registering
    event handlers, initializing internal data structures, and configuring bot-related
    subsystems. It must be called before any bot management operations can be performed.
    The method ensures that all necessary components are ready for bot lifecycle management
    and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the initialization process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all subsystems were
    properly set up, false otherwise. A failure typically indicates issues with system
    resources, configuration problems, or dependency failures that prevent proper
    bot lifecycle management.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotLifecycleMgr* mgr = BotLifecycleMgr::instance();\nif (mgr->Initialize())\
      \ {\n    // Bot lifecycle management is ready\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot lifecycle\
      \ manager initialized successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize bot lifecycle manager\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup or when the
    bot system needs to be reinitialized. It's thread-safe and performs all necessary
    setup operations synchronously. The initialization process may take a moment depending
    on the number of bots configured in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    undefined behavior. Ensure that any existing bot lifecycle management is properly
    shut down before calling Initialize again. This method should not be called from
    within bot event handlers or other asynchronous contexts.
