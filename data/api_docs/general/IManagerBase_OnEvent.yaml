documentation:
  brief: Handles events dispatched to the manager instance
  description: The OnEvent method serves as the primary event handling callback for
    IManagerBase implementations. It is invoked when an event occurs within the game
    system and allows the manager to respond appropriately based on the event type
    passed as a parameter. This method is typically used in conjunction with event-driven
    systems where managers need to react to various game events such as player actions,
    server ticks, or system notifications. The implementation should be designed to
    handle multiple event types efficiently without blocking or performing heavy operations
    that could impact performance.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: An integer representing the type of event being dispatched to this
      manager instance. Event types are typically defined by the system and may include
      values such as EVENT_UPDATE, EVENT_PLAYER_ENTER_WORLD, or custom manager-specific
      events.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyManager : public IManagerBase {\npublic:\n    void OnEvent(const\
      \ int& event) override {\n        switch (event) {\n            case EVENT_UPDATE:\n\
      \                // Handle update logic\n                break;\n          \
      \  case EVENT_PLAYER_ENTER_WORLD:\n                // Handle player entering\
      \ world\n                break;\n            default:\n                // Handle\
      \ unknown events\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n};"

    code: "class QuestManager : public IManagerBase {\nprivate:\n    static const\
      \ int EVENT_QUEST_START = 1001;\n    static const int EVENT_QUEST_COMPLETE =\
      \ 1002;\n\npublic:\n    void OnEvent(const int& event) override {\n        switch\
      \ (event) {\n            case EVENT_QUEST_START:\n                // Initialize\
      \ quest state\n                break;\n            case EVENT_QUEST_COMPLETE:\n\
      \                // Process quest completion\n                break;\n     \
      \       default:\n                // Forward to base class or ignore\n     \
      \           IManagerBase::OnEvent(event);\n                break;\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"

  notes: This method is expected to be thread-safe as it may be called from different
    threads within the TrinityCore architecture. Implementations should avoid performing
    long-running operations directly in this method to prevent blocking other event
    handlers. Consider using deferred execution patterns for heavy processing.
  warnings: Do not assume that event values are within a predefined range; always
    validate or handle unknown event types gracefully. Avoid calling blocking functions
    or performing database operations directly in this method as it may cause performance
    degradation or deadlocks.
