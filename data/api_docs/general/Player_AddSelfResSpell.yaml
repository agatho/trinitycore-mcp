documentation:
  brief: Adds a self-resurrection spell to the player's spell book.
  description: This method adds a self-resurrection spell to the player's spell book,
    allowing them to cast the spell on themselves when they die. The spellId parameter
    specifies which resurrection spell to add, typically corresponding to a specific
    spell that enables self-resurrection. This method is commonly used in custom scripts
    or game mechanics where players need to be granted access to certain resurrection
    abilities. The method does not immediately trigger the spell; it merely adds it
    to the player's available spells.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the self-resurrection spell to add. This is typically
      a spell ID that enables self-resurrection, such as 20546 (Resurrection Spell)
      or similar.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Self Resurrection Spell
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->AddSelfResSpell(20546); // Adds the Resurrection Spell

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect gameplay balance and
    may not be appropriate for all situations. It is typically used in custom scripts
    or game masters' code to grant players access to self-resurrection abilities.
  warnings: Using this method without proper context may lead to unbalanced gameplay
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a valid self-resurrection
    spell before calling this method.
