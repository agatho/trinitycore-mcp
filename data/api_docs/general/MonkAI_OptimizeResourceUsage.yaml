documentation:
  brief: Optimizes resource usage for the Monk AI by managing energy and ability allocation.
  description: The OptimizeResourceUsage method in the MonkAI class is responsible
    for dynamically managing a monk's resource allocation during combat. This method
    evaluates the current energy levels, available abilities, and combat state to
    determine the most efficient use of resources such as energy, chi, and special
    abilities. It ensures that the monk prioritizes abilities based on cooldowns,
    damage output, and strategic gameplay requirements. The method typically runs
    during AI update cycles to maintain optimal performance and resource management
    throughout encounters.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeResourceUsage();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The optimization logic
    considers both immediate combat needs and long-term resource sustainability.
