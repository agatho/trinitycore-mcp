  class: PaladinAI
  method: RecordAbilityUsage
  signature: void PaladinAI::RecordAbilityUsage(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the usage of a specified paladin ability by storing its spell ID
    for tracking and cooldown management.
  description: The RecordAbilityUsage method is used within the PaladinAI class to
    log when a specific paladin ability (identified by its spell ID) has been utilized.
    This functionality supports internal tracking mechanisms such as cooldowns, ability
    rotation optimization, and performance analytics. The method does not perform
    any direct action on the game state but rather maintains an in-memory record of
    ability usage for strategic decision-making by the AI. It is typically invoked
    when a paladin casts or uses an ability during combat to ensure accurate tracking
    of resource allocation and tactical decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific spell or ability
      being used. This value corresponds to the Spell ID defined in the game's database
      and uniquely identifies each paladin ability such as Judgement, Holy Shock,
      or Divine Storm.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a Paladin Ability Usage
    code: "void MyPaladinAI::OnSpellCast(Spell* spell)\n{\n    if (spell && spell->GetSpellInfo())\n\
      \    {\n        int spellId = spell->GetSpellInfo()->Id;\n        RecordAbilityUsage(spellId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI logic and should only be called from
    within the PaladinAI context. It assumes that the spell ID passed is valid and
    corresponds to a known paladin ability. The implementation likely stores usage
    data in an array or map for later retrieval during cooldown calculations or rotation
    decisions.
