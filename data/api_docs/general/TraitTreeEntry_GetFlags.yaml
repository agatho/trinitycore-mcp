  class: TraitTreeEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int TraitTreeEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bitmask associated with the trait tree entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer representing the combined flags
    that define various properties and behaviors of a trait tree entry in the World
    of Warcraft TrinityCore database. These flags typically control how traits are
    displayed, whether they're locked, if they can be purchased, or other behavioral
    aspects within the character's trait system. The returned value is a bitmask where
    individual bits correspond to specific trait tree characteristics. This method
    is commonly used during client-server communication to determine which UI elements
    should be enabled or disabled for a given trait tree.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bitmask for the trait tree entry.
    Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior of the
    trait tree, such as whether it's visible, purchasable, or locked. The exact meaning
    of each bit must be interpreted according to the game's internal flag definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a trait tree is visible
    code: "TraitTreeEntry const* entry = sTraitMgr->GetTraitTreeEntry(12345);\nif\
      \ (entry && (entry->GetFlags() & TRAIT_TREE_FLAG_VISIBLE)) {\n    // Trait tree\
      \ is visible to the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine if a trait tree can be modified
    code: "uint32 flags = traitTreeEntry->GetFlags();\nif (!(flags & TRAIT_TREE_FLAG_LOCKED))\
      \ {\n    // Player may modify this trait tree\n}\nelse {\n    // Trait tree\
      \ is locked and cannot be modified\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are defined in the game's internal constants and may vary
    between different versions of TrinityCore or patches. Developers should consult
    the relevant database schema or documentation to understand the meaning of each
    bit within the returned integer.
  warnings: This method returns a raw bitmask value; developers must ensure proper
    bit manipulation when checking specific flag states. Using incorrect bit masks
    can lead to unexpected behavior in trait tree handling logic.
