  class: Group
  method: StartCountdown
  signature: void Group::StartCountdown(CountdownTimerType timerType, int duration,
    int startTime)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a countdown timer for the group with specified type, duration,
    and start time.
  description: The StartCountdown method begins a countdown timer within the group
    context. It is typically used in scenarios such as raid encounters, battlegrounds,
    or other group-based events where timing is critical. The method accepts a timer
    type to determine how the countdown behaves, a duration in seconds, and an optional
    start time which may be used for synchronization purposes. This function does
    not return any value but triggers internal group timer logic that can affect player
    actions or game state changes depending on the timer type. The method should only
    be called when the group is active and valid.
  parameters:
  - name: timerType
    description: Specifies the type of countdown timer to start. Valid values are
      typically defined by an enum such as COUNTDOWN_TIMER_RAID, COUNTDOWN_TIMER_BATTLEGROUND,
      etc., determining how the timer is processed and displayed.
  - name: duration
    description: The total duration of the countdown in seconds. Must be a positive
      integer; negative values may cause undefined behavior or be ignored by the system.
  - name: startTime
    description: Optional parameter indicating the starting time for the countdown,
      usually expressed in milliseconds since epoch. If zero or unspecified, the current
      time is used as the base for the countdown.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Start a 30-second raid countdown
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->StartCountdown(COUNTDOWN_TIMER_RAID,\
      \ 30, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initiate a battleground countdown with custom start time
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    uint32 customStartTime\
      \ = getMSTime(); // Get current time in milliseconds\n    group->StartCountdown(COUNTDOWN_TIMER_BATTLEGROUND,\
      \ 60, customStartTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal timer management system of TrinityCore
    and may interact with other systems like instance timers or event scheduling.
    It is recommended to ensure that the group object is valid before calling this
    function to prevent potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling StartCountdown without a valid group context can lead to segmentation
    faults or corrupted game state. Always verify that player->GetGroup() returns
    a non-null pointer before invoking this method.
