  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SelectHighestValueReward
  signature: uint32 QuestTurnIn::SelectHighestValueReward(const int & rewards, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Selects the highest value reward from a set of quest rewards for a bot player.
  description: The SelectHighestValueReward method evaluates a collection of possible
    quest rewards and determines the one with the highest monetary or item value.
    This is commonly used in automated quest completion logic where bots need to optimize
    their reward selection. The method takes into account both gold rewards and item-based
    rewards, comparing their relative values to determine the most beneficial option
    for the bot player. It requires a valid Player object representing the bot that
    will receive the reward.
  parameters:
  - name: rewards
    description: An integer reference representing the set of possible quest rewards
      to evaluate. This typically contains reward identifiers or flags indicating
      different reward types available for selection.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to a Player object representing the bot player who will
      receive the selected reward. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to a player instance.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the identifier of the highest-value
    reward selected from the provided set. This could be an item entry ID, currency
    type, or reward flag depending on how rewards are structured in the quest system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to select highest reward
    code: "uint32 selectedReward = questTurnIn.SelectHighestValueReward(rewardFlags,\
      \ botPlayer);\n// Use selectedReward to determine which reward to claim\nif\
      \ (selectedReward > 0)\n{\n    // Process the selected reward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal logic to calculate reward values based on
    item quality, vendor prices, or quest-specific reward weights. The implementation
    may cache reward calculations for performance optimization when called repeatedly
    with similar inputs.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Improper handling of invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior in the TrinityCore environment.
