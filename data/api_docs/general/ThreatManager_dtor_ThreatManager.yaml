  brief: Destroys the ThreatManager instance and cleans up associated resources
  description: The ThreatManager destructor is responsible for cleaning up all threat-related
    data structures and releasing memory associated with the threat management system.
    This method ensures that any dynamically allocated memory or resources are properly
    freed, preventing memory leaks in the game world. It typically handles cleanup
    of threat lists, threat levels, and other related components that may have been
    initialized during the object's lifetime.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ThreatManager* manager = new ThreatManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called when a ThreatManager object goes out
    of scope or is deleted. It's important to note that this method should not be
    called directly in most cases, as it's handled by the C++ compiler during object
    destruction.
