documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ObjectMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ObjectMgr
    class, providing global access to the object manager responsible for managing
    game objects, creatures, items, and other core game entities. This method ensures
    that only one instance of ObjectMgr exists throughout the TrinityCore server runtime,
    allowing consistent access to game data and object management functionality. The
    returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid during server operation and should
    be used to access all ObjectMgr functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single global instance of ObjectMgr. This pointer is never
    null during normal server operation and provides access to all object management
    functions within the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectMgr* objMgr = ObjectMgr::instance();

      Player* player = objMgr->GetPlayer(guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Creature Data
    code: "ObjectMgr* objMgr = ObjectMgr::instance();\nCreatureTemplate const* creatureTemplate\
      \ = objMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\nif (creatureTemplate)\n{\n    // Use\
      \ creature template data\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature name: %s\", creatureTemplate->Name.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is initialized during
    server startup. The ObjectMgr singleton should be accessed through this method
    rather than creating new instances directly. This pattern ensures consistent object
    management across all server components.
