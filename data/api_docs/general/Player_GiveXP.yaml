documentation:
  brief: Gives experience points to a player, adjusting for group rate and victim
    reference.
  description: The GiveXP method distributes experience points to a player based on
    the provided XP amount, taking into account group rate modifiers and victim references.
    This method is typically used in game mechanics where players earn experience
    from killing creatures or completing quests. The method adjusts the experience
    gain based on whether the player is in a group and applies appropriate rate multipliers.
    It handles both individual and group experience distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: xp
    description: The amount of experience points to give to the player. This value
      represents the base experience earned from killing creatures or completing quests.
  - name: victim
    description: Reference to the victim that was killed, used for calculating experience
      adjustments and determining if the player should receive group bonuses. If null,
      no group bonus is applied.
  - name: group_rate
    description: The group rate multiplier applied to experience distribution. This
      value determines how much experience is awarded when multiple players are in
      a group, typically ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Experience Distribution
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 xp = 100;

      int victim = 0;

      float group_rate = 1.0f;

      player->GiveXP(xp, &victim, group_rate);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Experience with Rate Modifier
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 xp = 500;

      int victim = 1;

      float group_rate = 0.5f;

      player->GiveXP(xp, &victim, group_rate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects player experience
    and progression. The implementation handles both individual and group experience
    calculations, with proper adjustments for different group sizes and rates.
  warnings: The method may not properly handle edge cases where victim reference is
    null or when group rate is negative. Ensure that all parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
