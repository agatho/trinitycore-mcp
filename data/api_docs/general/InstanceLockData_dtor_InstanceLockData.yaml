documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceLockData object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the InstanceLockData class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this class likely manages
    data related to player instance locks, such as tracking which players have access
    to specific dungeon or raid instances. The destructor ensures that when an InstanceLockData
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, all internal data structures
    are properly deallocated to prevent memory leaks. This method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic destruction of InstanceLockData object
    code: 'InstanceLockData* lockData = new InstanceLockData();

      // ... use the object ...

      delete lockData; // Triggers ~InstanceLockData()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard C++ destructor and follows RAII (Resource Acquisition
    Is Initialization) principles. It's automatically called by the compiler when
    an object is destroyed, either through stack destruction or explicit deletion.
