  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadGameObjectTemplateAddons()
documentation:
  brief: Loads additional data for game object templates from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadGameObjectTemplateAddons method retrieves supplementary information
    associated with game object templates from the database and stores it in memory.
    This data typically includes addon-specific properties such as display IDs, phases,
    and other metadata that enhance the functionality or appearance of game objects.
    The method is usually invoked during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure all game object addons are properly initialized. It performs database
    queries to fetch relevant records and populates internal lookup structures for
    fast access during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadGameObjectTemplates()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadGameObjectTemplateAddons();\n\
      \    // Additional loading logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reloads.
    It's important to ensure that the database connection is active and that the relevant
    tables (like gameobject_template_addon) contain valid data before calling this
    method. The loaded data is stored in internal caches for fast lookup during runtime.
  warnings: Calling this method while objects are actively being used may lead to
    inconsistent behavior or crashes. It should only be invoked during safe periods
    such as server startup or controlled database reloads. Improper handling of database
    connections or malformed addon data can cause the method to fail silently or corrupt
    internal caches.
