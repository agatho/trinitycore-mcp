api:
  class: OutdoorPvP
  method: TeamApplyBuff
  signature: void OutdoorPvP::TeamApplyBuff(int team, int spellId, int spellId2)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a buff spell to all players on the specified team within the OutdoorPvP
    area.
  description: The TeamApplyBuff method is used to grant a specific spell effect to
    all players belonging to a given team within an OutdoorPvP zone. This method typically
    handles the application of buffs such as haste, damage increases, or other temporary
    enhancements that are tied to control of the OutdoorPvP territory. The buff is
    applied directly to players in the area and may be used for gameplay mechanics
    like territorial dominance bonuses or reward systems. It's important to note that
    this function likely operates within the context of a larger OutdoorPvP system
    where team-based control affects various game elements.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) to which the buff
      will be applied. Valid values are typically 0 or 1.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the primary spell effect to apply to players on the specified
      team. This should correspond to a valid spell in the game database.
  - name: spellId2
    description: The ID of an optional secondary spell effect to apply. This parameter
      may be used for additional buff effects or as a fallback when the primary spell
      is not applicable.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply Buff to Horde Players
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPToZoneId(1234);\nif (pvp)\n\
      {\n    pvp->TeamApplyBuff(1, 12345, 12346); // Apply buff to Horde players\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Buff Application
    code: "OutdoorPvP* pvp = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetOutdoorPvPToZoneId(5678);\nif (pvp\
      \ && pvp->GetActive())\n{\n    if (pvp->GetTeam() == TEAM_HORDE)\n        pvp->TeamApplyBuff(1,\
      \ 98765, 98766); // Apply special Horde buff\n    else\n        pvp->TeamApplyBuff(0,\
      \ 98765, 98766); // Apply special Alliance buff\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers spell application logic that includes checking
    if players are within the OutdoorPvP zone, verifying team membership, and applying
    the specified spells. It may also involve synchronization with client-side updates
    to ensure visual feedback of the applied buffs.
  warnings: Improper use of spell IDs can result in invalid or unintended behavior.
    Ensure that the provided spell IDs exist in the game database and are appropriate
    for OutdoorPvP mechanics. Also, calling this method outside of a valid OutdoorPvP
    context may lead to undefined behavior.
