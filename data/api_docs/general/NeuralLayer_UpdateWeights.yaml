  class: NeuralLayer
  method: UpdateWeights
  signature: void NeuralLayer::UpdateWeights(float learningRate, float momentum)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the weights of neurons in the neural layer using gradient descent
    with specified learning rate and momentum.
  description: The UpdateWeights method performs weight updates on all neurons within
    the neural layer based on computed gradients. It applies the standard gradient
    descent algorithm enhanced with momentum to accelerate convergence and reduce
    oscillations during training. This method is typically called after forward and
    backward propagation steps in a neural network training cycle. The update incorporates
    both the learning rate, which controls the step size of weight adjustments, and
    momentum, which helps smooth out updates by considering previous weight changes.
    In the context of World of Warcraft's AI systems, this method would be used to
    refine NPC behavior patterns through machine learning techniques.
  parameters:
  - name: learningRate
    description: Controls the step size of weight adjustments during gradient descent.
      Higher values lead to faster learning but may cause instability. Typical values
      range from 0.001 to 0.1.
  - name: momentum
    description: Factor that influences how much of the previous weight update is
      incorporated into the current update. Helps smooth training and escape local
      minima. Values typically range from 0.5 to 0.99.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weight Update
    code: 'NeuralLayer layer;

      layer.UpdateWeights(0.01f, 0.9f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Training Loop Integration
    code: "for (int epoch = 0; epoch < 1000; ++epoch)\n{\n    // Forward pass\n  \
      \  layer.Forward(input);\n    \n    // Backward pass\n    layer.Backward(target);\n\
      \    \n    // Update weights\n    layer.UpdateWeights(0.001f, 0.95f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the neural layer directly. It
    assumes that gradient computations have already been performed via Backward()
    or similar methods. The momentum term accumulates velocity from previous updates,
    so initial calls may behave differently than subsequent ones. For optimal performance,
    ensure that learning rate and momentum values are tuned appropriately for your
    specific neural network architecture.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior gradient computation will result in
    incorrect weight updates and potentially unstable training behavior. The method
    does not validate parameter ranges, so invalid learning rates or momentum values
    may cause unexpected convergence behavior or divergence.
