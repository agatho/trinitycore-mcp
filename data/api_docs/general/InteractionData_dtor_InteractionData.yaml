  class: InteractionData
  method: ~InteractionData
  signature: void InteractionData::~InteractionData()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InteractionData object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~InteractionData destructor is automatically invoked when an InteractionData
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the interaction
    data instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, InteractionData
    typically represents transient interaction state between game entities such as
    players and game objects, or NPCs and players. The destructor performs necessary
    cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability. It is important
    to note that this method should not be called directly unless explicitly managing
    object lifetime.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InteractionData
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    InteractionData data;\n    // ... use data\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when data goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of InteractionData pointer
    code: 'InteractionData* dataPtr = new InteractionData();

      // ... use dataPtr ...

      delete dataPtr; // Triggers ~InteractionData destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects are destroyed.
    Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom
    memory management patterns. The destruction process typically involves releasing
    any heap-allocated memory, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no
    dangling references remain.
  warnings: Do not explicitly call the destructor unless you're managing object lifetime
    through manual memory allocation. Calling ~InteractionData() directly on stack-allocated
    objects can lead to undefined behavior or double-free errors.
