  brief: Moves a CreatureTextMgr object to another CreatureTextMgr object, transferring
    all managed text data and resources.
  description: This is the move constructor for the CreatureTextMgr class. It transfers
    ownership of all internal data and resources from the source CreatureTextMgr object
    to the current object. After the move operation, the source object will be left
    in a valid but unspecified state. This constructor is typically used when creating
    new CreatureTextMgr instances or reassigning existing ones through move semantics.
    The CreatureTextMgr class manages creature text entries for World of Warcraft's
    NPC dialogue system, handling text groups, probabilities, and associated data
    for creature interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'CreatureTextMgr sourceManager;

      // ... populate sourceManager with text data ...

      CreatureTextMgr newManager = std::move(sourceManager);

      // sourceManager is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // newManager contains all the moved data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor enables efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary
    copying of large text datasets. It's particularly useful when passing CreatureTextMgr
    objects between functions or storing them in containers like std::vector. The
    implementation should ensure that no resources are leaked during the move operation.
  warnings: Using this constructor after moving from an object can lead to undefined
    behavior if the moved-from object is subsequently used. Always ensure that moved-from
    objects are not accessed after a move operation, and consider setting them to
    a default state if needed.
