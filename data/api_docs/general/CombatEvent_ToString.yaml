  brief: Converts a CombatEvent object into a human-readable string representation
  description: The ToString method provides a formatted string output of the CombatEvent
    object's current state, including relevant combat data such as event type, involved
    entities, damage values, and timestamps. This method is primarily used for debugging,
    logging, or displaying combat information in a readable format within the TrinityCore
    framework. The returned string typically contains structured data that can be
    parsed or displayed to developers or end users for monitoring combat events in
    real-time. No specific preconditions are required for calling this method, and
    it does not modify the object's internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing a formatted representation of the CombatEvent
    object, including event details such as type, involved parties, damage values,
    and timing information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debug Logging
    code: 'CombatEvent event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      std::string eventStr = event.ToString();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("combat", "Combat Event: {}", eventStr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Combat Event in Game Chat
    code: 'CombatEvent event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      Player* player = ...;

      player->Say(event.ToString(), LANG_UNIVERSAL);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact format of the returned string may vary depending on how the CombatEvent
    class is implemented and what fields are considered relevant for display. This
    method should not be used in performance-critical paths due to potential string
    formatting overhead.
