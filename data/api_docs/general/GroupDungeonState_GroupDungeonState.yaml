  signature: void GroupDungeonState::GroupDungeonState(uint32 gId, uint32 dId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GroupDungeonState object with specified group and dungeon identifiers
  description: The GroupDungeonState constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupDungeonState class by setting its internal group ID (gId) and dungeon ID
    (dId). This class is typically used within TrinityCore's dungeon group management
    system to track which group is associated with which dungeon instance. The constructor
    does not perform any validation on the input values, so it's expected that valid
    IDs are passed in. This initialization step is crucial for maintaining proper
    dungeon group state tracking throughout the game session.
  parameters:
  - name: gId
    description: The unique identifier of the group that will be associated with this
      dungeon state
  - name: dId
    description: The unique identifier of the dungeon instance that this group is
      assigned to
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'GroupDungeonState state(12345, 67890);

      // Creates a new GroupDungeonState for group ID 12345 and dungeon ID 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Dungeon Management Context
    code: 'uint32 groupId = player->GetGroup()->GetId();

      uint32 dungeonId = sObjectMgr->GetDungeonIdForPlayer(player);

      GroupDungeonState* gds = new GroupDungeonState(groupId, dungeonId);

      // Initializes a group dungeon state for tracking purposes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing group dungeon instances. It's important to note that this method
    only stores the IDs and doesn't perform any database operations or validation
    checks. The actual dungeon instance management logic would be handled by other
    methods in the GroupDungeonState class.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called directly unless you
    understand the implications of creating a new GroupDungeonState object. Improper
    use may lead to inconsistent group tracking or invalid dungeon state management.
    Ensure that the provided IDs are valid before calling this constructor.
