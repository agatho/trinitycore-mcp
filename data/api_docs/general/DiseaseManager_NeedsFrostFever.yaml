  method: NeedsFrostFever
  signature: bool DiseaseManager::NeedsFrostFever(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target unit requires the Frost Fever disease effect.
  description: The NeedsFrostFever method evaluates if a given Unit target is eligible
    to receive or currently requires the Frost Fever disease application. This typically
    occurs in the context of disease mechanics within World of Warcraft's combat system,
    particularly when dealing with frost-based afflictions such as those applied by
    certain spells or abilities. The method checks various conditions including the
    target's immunity status, existing disease states, and other relevant game mechanics
    to determine if Frost Fever should be applied or maintained on the unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit requires Frost Fever application or maintenance;
    otherwise returns false if the unit is immune, already affected, or otherwise
    ineligible for the disease effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "if (diseaseManager.NeedsFrostFever(targetUnit)) {\n    // Apply Frost Fever\
      \ to target\n    targetUnit->AddAura(SPELL_FROST_FEVER, caster);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Disease Application
    code: "if (diseaseManager.NeedsFrostFever(target)) {\n    // Check for existing\
      \ Frost Fever\n    if (!target->HasAura(SPELL_FROST_FEVER)) {\n        target->AddAura(SPELL_FROST_FEVER,\
      \ caster);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal disease tracking systems and may
    consider factors such as unit type, resistance status, and existing aura states.
    It is typically called during spell casting or disease application logic to ensure
    proper targeting and effect application.
  warnings: Ensure that the target Unit pointer is valid before calling this method
    to prevent null pointer dereferences. The method's behavior may depend on specific
    game mechanics or patch versions, so verify compatibility in your environment.
