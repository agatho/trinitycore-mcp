  class: RenewTracker
  method: RemoveRenew
  signature: void RenewTracker::RemoveRenew(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a renew effect from the tracker using the specified GUID.
  description: The RemoveRenew method is responsible for removing a specific renew
    effect from the RenewTracker. This method takes a unique identifier (GUID) as
    input and removes the corresponding renew entry from the internal tracking structure.
    The method likely operates on a collection or map of active renew effects, using
    the provided GUID to locate and remove the appropriate entry. This functionality
    is typically used in game mechanics involving spell effects such as Renew, where
    tracking active buffs is necessary for proper gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the renew effect to be removed from
      the tracker. This value should correspond to a valid GUID previously added to
      the tracker.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'RenewTracker tracker;

      // Assume some renew effect has been added with GUID 12345

      tracker.RemoveRenew(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal data structure (such as a map
    or list) that stores active renew effects. The implementation may include checks
    to ensure the GUID exists before attempting removal, though this is not explicitly
    stated in the signature.
