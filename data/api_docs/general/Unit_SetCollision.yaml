  class: Unit
  method: SetCollision
  signature: bool Unit::SetCollision(bool disable)
documentation:
  brief: Disables or enables collision detection for the unit.
  description: The SetCollision method controls whether a unit's collision detection
    is enabled or disabled. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    to manage how units interact with the environment and other objects. When disabled,
    the unit can pass through obstacles and other units without collision. When enabled,
    the unit will collide with other objects as expected. The method returns true
    if the operation was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the collision state was successfully set, false if the
    operation failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nbool result = unit->SetCollision(true);\nif (result)\
      \ {\n    // Collision enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nbool result = unit->SetCollision(false);\nif\
      \ (!result) {\n    // Collision disabled\n}\n// This allows the unit to pass\
      \ through walls or other units"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during unit movement or when setting up special
    behaviors for units. It may affect performance if used frequently, as collision
    detection requires additional processing. The method is thread-safe and can be
    called from any thread.
  warnings: Be cautious when disabling collision, as it may cause units to pass through
    objects they shouldn't. This could lead to unexpected behavior in game mechanics
    or player interactions.
