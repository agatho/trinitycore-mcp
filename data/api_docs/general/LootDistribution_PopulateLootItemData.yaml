documentation:
  brief: Populates loot item data with relevant information for distribution.
  description: The PopulateLootItemData method is responsible for initializing and
    filling a LootItem structure with all necessary data required for proper loot
    distribution within the TrinityCore framework. This includes setting up item identifiers,
    stack counts, chance values, and other properties needed during the loot rolling
    process. The method ensures that each loot item has valid and consistent data
    before it is added to the loot distribution system. It typically gets invoked
    when preparing items for a group or individual player loot roll, ensuring that
    all relevant metadata is correctly populated for accurate gameplay mechanics.

      // Item is now ready for distribution logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot management system and should not
    be called directly by external modules unless implementing custom loot behavior.
    It assumes that the LootItem object has been properly initialized before calling.
