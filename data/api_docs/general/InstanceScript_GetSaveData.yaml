  class: InstanceScript
  method: GetSaveData
  signature: std::string InstanceScript::GetSaveData()
documentation:
  brief: Serializes and returns the instance's saved data state as a string for persistence.
  description: The GetSaveData method is responsible for serializing the current state
    of an instance script into a string format that can be persisted to the database.
    This method is typically called during instance cleanup or when saving the world
    state, ensuring that all relevant instance data such as boss encounter statuses,
    object states, and quest progress are preserved. The returned string is usually
    parsed by the LoadSaveData method upon instance reload or player re-entry. This
    mechanism allows for seamless continuation of instance content across server restarts
    or player logouts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the serialized instance data, typically formatted
    as a JSON-like structure or custom delimited format that can be parsed by LoadSaveData
    to restore the instance's state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom Instance Script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n\n    std::string GetSaveData() override\n\
      \    {\n        std::ostringstream saveStream;\n        saveStream << \"1 0\
      \ 1\"; // Example: boss1 alive, boss2 dead, door open\n        return saveStream.str();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore instance persistence system and should
    be overridden in custom instance scripts. The returned string format must match
    what is expected by LoadSaveData to ensure proper state restoration.
