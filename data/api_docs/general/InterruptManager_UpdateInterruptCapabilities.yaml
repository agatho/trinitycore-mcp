  method: UpdateInterruptCapabilities
  signature: void InterruptManager::UpdateInterruptCapabilities()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the interrupt capabilities of all active interrupts in the manager.
  description: The UpdateInterruptCapabilities method refreshes and synchronizes the
    interrupt states for all managed interrupts within the InterruptManager. This
    method is typically invoked during game loop updates or when interrupt conditions
    change, ensuring that all interruptible actions maintain accurate state information.
    It evaluates current interrupt eligibility, checks for valid interrupt sources,
    and updates internal tracking structures accordingly. The method operates on a
    per-interrupt basis, recalculating whether each interrupt can be triggered based
    on the current game context and player state.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    interruptManager.UpdateInterruptCapabilities();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    interrupt state tracking. It may involve performance considerations if a large
    number of interrupts are being managed simultaneously.
