documentation:
  brief: Predicts when a vendor will restock their items based on current game mechanics
    and timers.
  description: The PredictVendorRestocking method calculates and updates the expected
    restock time for a vendor's inventory. This method is typically invoked when a
    player interacts with a vendor to check item availability or when the vendor's
    stock is depleted. It uses internal timers, game rules, and vendor-specific configurations
    to determine when new items will become available for purchase. The prediction
    takes into account factors such as restock intervals, server time, and any dynamic
    adjustments made by the game logic. This functionality helps maintain realistic
    trading mechanics within the World of Warcraft environment.

  - title: Basic Vendor Restocking Prediction
    code: 'VendorInteraction* vendorInteraction = new VendorInteraction();

      vendorInteraction->PredictVendorRestocking(12345); // Predict restock for vendor
      with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal vendor state variables and may trigger
    updates to the client's UI to reflect new restock timers. It should only be called
    when a vendor's inventory status has changed or when a player requests information
    about item availability.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper vendor context or during inappropriate
    game states may lead to incorrect predictions or inconsistent behavior in vendor
    interactions. Ensure that the vendor GUID is valid and corresponds to an active
    vendor before invoking this method.
