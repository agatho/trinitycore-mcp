  class: CreatureAI

  signature: void CreatureAI::KilledUnit(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when the creature kills a unit, allowing AI to respond to kill events.
  description: The KilledUnit method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when
    a CreatureAI-controlled creature successfully kills another unit. This method
    serves as a hook for custom AI behavior in response to kills, such as triggering
    quest progress, playing specific animations, or modifying the creature's state.
    It is part of the standard CreatureAI interface and can be overridden by custom
    AI implementations to add game-specific logic. The method does not take any parameters
    beyond the implicit 'this' pointer, and its primary purpose is to notify the AI
    that a kill has occurred.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void KilledUnit(Unit*\
      \ victim) override\n    {\n        // Custom logic when creature kills a unit\n\
      \        if (victim->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n        {\n            //\
      \ Handle player kill\n            DoAction(ACTION_PLAYER_KILLED);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called after the kill has been processed by the game engine.
    It's important to note that this method signature in the provided spec appears
    to be incorrect or simplified; the actual TrinityCore implementation typically
    takes a Unit* parameter. Custom AI implementations should ensure they properly
    handle potential null pointers and check the type of unit killed.
  warnings: Do not perform heavy operations within this method as it's called frequently
    during combat. Avoid calling methods that may cause recursion or modify the creature's
    state in ways that could lead to instability. The method is part of the AI update
    cycle, so ensure thread safety if implementing custom behavior.
