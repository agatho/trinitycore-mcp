api:
  class: SpellMgr
  method: GetSpellLearnedBySpellMapBounds
  signature: int SpellMgr::GetSpellLearnedBySpellMapBounds(uint32 learnedSpellId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of spell learn entries associated with a given learned
    spell ID from the spell learning map.
  description: This method accesses the internal spell learning map within the SpellMgr
    class to determine how many entries are registered for a specific spell that is
    learned by another spell. It serves as a lookup mechanism to understand the relationship
    between spells and their learnable dependencies. The returned count represents
    the number of entries in the spell learn map where the specified spell ID is used
    as the learned spell identifier. This functionality is crucial for handling spell
    learning mechanics, such as determining how many skills or abilities can be learned
    from a particular spell. The method does not modify any data but only performs
    a lookup operation based on the provided spell ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of entries in the spell learn map that
    reference the given learned spell ID. Returns zero if no such entries exist or
    if the input spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 learnedSpellId = 12345;\nint count = sSpellMgr->GetSpellLearnedBySpellMapBounds(learnedSpellId);\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Process the number of learnable spells\n    printf(\"\
      Found %d spell learn entries for spell ID %u\\n\", count, learnedSpellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell learning APIs
    to manage and query spell dependencies. It's important to note that the returned
    value reflects only the number of entries and does not provide details about each
    individual entry. The internal map structure may be optimized for fast lookups,
    but performance can vary depending on the size of the spell database.
  warnings: Ensure that the input spell ID is valid before calling this method, as
    invalid IDs might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect counts. This method
    should not be used for modifying data; it's purely a read-only lookup operation.
