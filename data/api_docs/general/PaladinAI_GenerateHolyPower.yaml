  signature: void PaladinAI::GenerateHolyPower(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Generates holy power for the paladin based on AI decision-making logic.
  description: The GenerateHolyPower method is responsible for managing the generation
    of holy power within the PaladinAI class. This method typically handles the logic
    for when and how holy power should be generated, which is a core resource for
    paladins in World of Warcraft. It may involve checking current spell cooldowns,
    evaluating target conditions, or determining optimal timing for holy power generation
    based on combat state and available abilities. The method operates within the
    broader context of AI decision-making for paladin gameplay, ensuring that holy
    power is generated efficiently to support subsequent spell casting and ability
    usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit for holy power
      generation. This parameter may be used to determine targeting logic or influence
      the amount of holy power generated based on threat level or target type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with target
    code: 'int targetUnit = 12345;

      PaladinAI* ai = new PaladinAI();

      ai->GenerateHolyPower(&targetUnit);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in combat scenario
    code: "Unit* currentTarget = me->GetVictim();\nif (currentTarget)\n{\n    int\
      \ targetId = currentTarget->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    GenerateHolyPower(&targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework for paladin class behavior in TrinityCore.
    It should only be called when the paladin is in a state where holy power generation
    is appropriate, such as during combat or when certain conditions are met. The
    actual implementation details may vary based on specific paladin specialization
    and current game state.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit before calling
    this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. This method should not be
    called outside of proper AI execution contexts as it relies on internal AI state
    variables.
