documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the quest menu contains any available quests.
  description: The QuestMenu::Empty() method determines if the player's current quest
    menu is empty, meaning no quests are available for interaction. This method is
    commonly used in the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework to control UI behavior
    and quest flow. It typically returns true when there are no quests in the menu,
    and false when at least one quest is present. The check is performed against the
    internal state of the quest menu associated with a specific player or NPC interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest menu contains no quests, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Quest Menu is Empty Before Showing UI
    code: "if (player->GetPlayerMenu()->Empty())\n{\n    player->SendNoQuestMessage();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestList();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's current quest menu state and should
    be called after any quest-related operations that might modify the menu contents.
    It is a read-only operation and does not alter the internal state of the quest
    menu.
