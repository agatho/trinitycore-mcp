documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all criteria definitions from the database into memory
    for active use in achievement tracking.
  description: The LoadCriteriaList method is responsible for retrieving all criteria
    data from the game's database and loading it into memory for runtime evaluation.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when criteria data needs
    to be refreshed, ensuring that all achievements and related tracking systems have
    access to the latest criteria definitions. It processes the raw database entries
    and prepares them for use in evaluating player progress towards various achievements,
    quests, and other game milestones. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no direct return operations; instead, it populates internal data structures
    used by the CriteriaMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'CriteriaMgr* criteriaMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetCriteriaMgr();

      criteriaMgr->LoadCriteriaList();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup sequence and should not
    be invoked repeatedly during runtime unless database schema changes have occurred.
    The loaded criteria data is cached in memory for fast access during achievement
    evaluation.
  warnings: Calling this method while achievements are being evaluated may lead to
    inconsistent behavior or data corruption. It should only be used during safe initialization
    or maintenance periods.
