  class: MonkAI
  method: UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic
  signature: void MonkAI::UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the advanced combat logic for a Monk AI, determining optimal abilities
    and target selection based on current combat state.
  description: The UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic method is responsible for implementing
    sophisticated decision-making processes for a Monk AI character during combat.
    It evaluates the current battlefield conditions, including health levels of targets,
    available mana, cooldowns of abilities, and positional factors to determine the
    most effective next action. This method typically integrates with the broader
    AI framework to select appropriate martial arts techniques, healing abilities,
    or defensive measures based on real-time combat data. The method may also update
    internal state variables that track combat progression and strategic decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target identifier.
      This parameter is used to determine which enemy to prioritize for attacks or
      abilities, and may be updated by this method based on combat logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    int currentTarget = GetTargetId();\n    monkAI->UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(&currentTarget);\n\
      \    SetTarget(currentTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Machine
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAdvancedCombatLogic(int* target)\n{\n    if (IsInMeleeRange(*target))\n\
      \        UseStrikeAbility(target);\n    else if (HasManaForHeal())\n       \
      \ UseHealingAbility(target);\n    else\n        UseDefensiveAbility();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat to ensure the AI adapts
    to changing battlefield conditions. It is recommended that this function not be
    called too frequently to avoid performance degradation in high-frequency combat
    scenarios.
  warnings: The target parameter must point to a valid integer; dereferencing an invalid
    pointer may cause undefined behavior. This method modifies the value pointed to
    by target, so ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
