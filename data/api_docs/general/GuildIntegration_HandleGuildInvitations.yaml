  class: GuildIntegration
  method: HandleGuildInvitations
  signature: void GuildIntegration::HandleGuildInvitations(int * player, uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles incoming guild invitations for a player.
  description: The HandleGuildInvitations method is responsible for managing guild
    invitation requests sent to a player within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    typically receives a pointer to a player object and a guild identifier, then performs
    necessary checks such as whether the player has already joined a guild, if the
    invitation is still valid, or if the player has reached maximum guild membership
    limits. It may also update the player's internal state to reflect pending invitations
    and trigger appropriate game events or UI updates. The method operates within
    the context of World of Warcraft's guild system and integrates with the core game
    logic for managing player affiliations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose guild invitations are being processed.
      Must not be null.
  - name: guildId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild sending the invitation. Used to verify
      the invitation's validity and associate it with the correct guild data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));

      uint32 guildId = 67890;

      GuildIntegration::HandleGuildInvitations(&player, guildId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures such as player
    guild membership flags and invitation caches. It should be called only when a
    valid invitation is received from the server or another player to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. Also, verify that the guildId corresponds to an
    actual existing guild in the database.
