  class: BehaviorPriorityManager
  method: RegisterStrategy
  signature: void BehaviorPriorityManager::RegisterStrategy(Strategy * strategy, BehaviorPriority
    priority, bool exclusive)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a behavior strategy with specified priority and exclusivity settings.
  description: The RegisterStrategy method adds a BehaviorStrategy to the BehaviorPriorityManager,
    associating it with a specific priority level and determining whether it should
    be treated as exclusive. This allows the system to manage multiple strategies
    and determine their execution order based on priority levels, while also controlling
    whether certain strategies can coexist or if they should be mutually exclusive.
    The method is typically used during AI initialization or strategy configuration
    phases.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: Pointer to the Strategy object to register. Must not be null. The
      strategy defines specific behavior patterns for AI decision-making.
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level for this strategy. Higher values indicate higher
      priority, with strategies executing first. BehaviorPriority is typically an
      enum or integer type representing priority tiers.
  - name: exclusive
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the strategy should be exclusive. When
      true, no other strategies can execute alongside this one. When false, multiple
      non-exclusive strategies may run concurrently.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Registration
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager* manager = ...;

      Strategy* myStrategy = new MyCustomStrategy();

      manager->RegisterStrategy(myStrategy, BehaviorPriority::HIGH, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Exclusive Strategy Registration
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager* manager = ...;

      Strategy* exclusiveStrategy = new ExclusiveCombatStrategy();

      manager->RegisterStrategy(exclusiveStrategy, BehaviorPriority::CRITICAL, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate that the strategy pointer is valid before use.
    It's assumed that all strategies passed to this method are properly initialized
    and managed by the caller. The manager maintains ownership of registered strategies
    for execution purposes.
  warnings: Passing a null strategy pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or
    crashes. Ensure all strategies are properly allocated and initialized before registration.
    Be cautious when mixing exclusive and non-exclusive strategies as it may affect
    AI decision-making flow.
