  brief: Destroys a CastSpellExtraArgs object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CastSpellExtraArgs class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the
    object. This method is automatically invoked when an instance of CastSpellExtraArgs
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's spell
    system, this class is typically used to pass additional parameters and metadata
    when casting spells, such as extra damage multipliers, proc chances, or custom
    spell effects. The destructor ensures proper cleanup of any internal data structures
    or pointers held by the object, preventing memory leaks within the game engine's
    spell casting subsystem.

  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: "void SomeSpellFunction()\n{\n    CastSpellExtraArgs args;\n    // ... use\
      \ args ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when args goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion in Heap Allocation
    code: "void AnotherSpellFunction()\n{\n    CastSpellExtraArgs* args = new CastSpellExtraArgs();\n\
      \    // ... use args ...\n    delete args; // Triggers destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a default-generated function in this case, meaning it performs
    standard cleanup operations for the class members. If the class had virtual functions
    or custom cleanup logic, the destructor might have been overridden to provide
    specialized behavior. Developers should be aware that while this destructor handles
    basic cleanup, any complex resource management would typically be handled through
    smart pointers or custom destructors.
  warnings: Since this is a destructor, it should not be called directly by user code
    unless explicitly managing heap-allocated objects. Direct invocation of destructors
    can lead to undefined behavior if the object is not properly managed. Also, ensure
    that any resources allocated within the class are correctly freed during destruction
    to prevent memory leaks.
