documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat triggers for the strategy
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    combat triggers for a given CombatStrategy instance. This method is typically
    called during the initialization phase of an AI behavior to establish the conditions
    under which specific combat actions should be executed. It populates internal
    trigger lists with appropriate event handlers and conditions that govern how the
    AI responds to various combat scenarios such as target acquisition, health thresholds,
    or spell availability. The method ensures that all required triggers are registered
    before the strategy begins executing its combat logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Initialization
    code: 'CombatStrategy* strategy = new CombatStrategy();

      strategy->InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a CombatStrategy
    instance. Reinitializing triggers may result in duplicate registrations or unexpected
    behavior. The method is typically invoked automatically by the AI system during
    strategy activation.
  warnings: Do not call InitializeTriggers manually unless you understand the implications
    of reinitializing trigger systems. Improper usage can lead to memory leaks or
    inconsistent AI behavior.
