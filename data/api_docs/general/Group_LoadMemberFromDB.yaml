  class: Group
  method: LoadMemberFromDB
  signature: void Group::LoadMemberFromDB(int guidLow, int memberFlags, int subgroup,
    int roles)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a group member from the database using the provided member data.
  description: The LoadMemberFromDB method is responsible for initializing and loading
    group member data into a Group object from the database. This method takes low
    GUID, member flags, subgroup index, and role information to properly set up the
    internal state of the group member. It is typically called during group initialization
    or when adding members to an existing group. The method does not return any value
    but modifies the internal state of the Group object directly. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining accurate group membership data in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: guidLow
    description: The low GUID of the player member to load from the database. This
      represents the unique identifier for the player within the group context.
  - name: memberFlags
    description: Bitfield containing various flags that define the member's status
      and properties within the group, such as online status, loot settings, etc.
  - name: subgroup
    description: The subgroup index (0-8) where this member belongs within the group.
      Subgroups are used for organizing players in raid groups.
  - name: roles
    description: Role flags indicating the member's role within the group, such as
      tank, healer, or damage dealer, which affects loot distribution and other mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group initialization
    code: 'Group* group = new Group();

      // Load a member with GUID 12345, online status, subgroup 0, no special roles

      group->LoadMemberFromDB(12345, GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_DEFAULT, 0, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading multiple group members
    code: 'Group* raid = new Group();

      raid->LoadMemberFromDB(1001, GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_ONLINE | GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_MAIN_TANK,
      0, PLAYER_ROLE_TANK);

      raid->LoadMemberFromDB(1002, GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_ONLINE | GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_MAIN_HEALER,
      1, PLAYER_ROLE_HEALER);

      raid->LoadMemberFromDB(1003, GROUP_MEMBER_FLAG_ONLINE, 2, PLAYER_ROLE_DPS);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during group creation or when restoring
    group state from database storage. It assumes that the Group object has already
    been initialized and that the database connection is active. The method directly
    modifies internal member data structures without requiring additional synchronization
    mechanisms.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUID values may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this method,
    especially when loading data from external sources. Incorrect subgroup indices
    or role flags can cause unexpected group behavior during gameplay.
