documentation:
  brief: Sends PvP options enabled status to the client.
  description: This method handles the client request for PvP options enabled status.
    It retrieves the current PvP settings from the server configuration and sends
    them back to the connected client in a structured packet format. The method is
    typically invoked when a player requests information about available PvP options,
    such as arena team participation, rated battlegrounds, or other PvP-related features
    that may be enabled or disabled on the server. This allows the client UI to accurately
    reflect which PvP activities are currently available to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: getPvPOptionsEnabled
    description: The incoming packet containing the client's request for PvP options
      status. This parameter is used to determine what information should be sent
      back to the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGetPVPOptionsEnabled(WorldPackets::Battleground::GetPVPOptionsEnabled&\
      \ getPvPOptionsEnabled)\n{\n    // Process the request and send back PvP options\n\
      \    WorldPacket data(SMSG_PVP_OPTIONS_ENABLED);\n    data << uint8(1); // Example:\
      \ PvP enabled flag\n    SendPacket(data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground and PvP system integration. It's
    important to ensure that the server configuration accurately reflects the PvP
    options being sent to clients, as discrepancies can cause client-side UI inconsistencies
    or unexpected behavior during PvP activities.
