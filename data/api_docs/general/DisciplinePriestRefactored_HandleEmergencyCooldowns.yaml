  signature: bool DisciplinePriestRefactored::HandleEmergencyCooldowns(const int &
    group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles emergency cooldown management for discipline priest abilities based
    on the specified group.
  description: The HandleEmergencyCooldowns method is responsible for managing and
    applying emergency cooldown reductions or resets for various discipline priest
    abilities. This method typically activates when specific combat conditions are
    met, such as taking damage or entering a high-stress scenario. It evaluates the
    provided group parameter to determine which set of cooldowns should be processed.
    The method ensures that critical abilities remain available during intense combat
    situations by reducing their cooldown timers or triggering immediate availability.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining optimal spell usage and survivability
    in challenging encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing the cooldown group to process.
      Valid values typically correspond to specific ability sets within the discipline
      priest's spell rotation, such as 0 for basic abilities, 1 for defensive cooldowns,
      or 2 for utility spells.
  returns: Returns true if the emergency cooldown handling was successfully processed
    and applied; returns false if no applicable cooldowns were found or if processing
    failed due to invalid group values or internal constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (priest->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(1)) {\n    // Emergency defensive\
      \ cooldowns applied successfully\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"Priest\", \"Emergency cooldowns\
      \ processed for group 1\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "int cooldownGroup = 0;\nif (player->GetHealth() < player->GetMaxHealth()\
      \ * 0.3f) {\n    cooldownGroup = 1; // Defensive cooldowns\n} else if (player->GetPower(POWER_MANA)\
      \ < player->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA) * 0.2f) {\n    cooldownGroup = 2; // Utility\
      \ cooldowns\n}\n\nif (priest->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(cooldownGroup)) {\n \
      \   // Apply emergency cooldown effects based on current state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during combat events or specific damage
    triggers. The group parameter determines which cooldown sets are eligible for
    emergency processing, and it's important that these groups align with the priest's
    actual spellbook configuration. Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight
    as it's often called in high-frequency combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is within valid range to prevent undefined
    behavior or crashes. Improper handling of cooldown groups may result in incorrect
    ability availability or unexpected gameplay mechanics. This method assumes proper
    initialization of priest abilities and cooldown tracking systems.
