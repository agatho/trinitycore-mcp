api:
  class: Player
  method: GetRaidDifficultyID
  signature: int Player::GetRaidDifficultyID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current raid difficulty identifier for the player.
  description: The GetRaidDifficultyID method retrieves the active raid difficulty
    setting for the player, which determines the type of raid content they are currently
    participating in. This value corresponds to the difficulty ID used in game mechanics
    and is essential for determining which raid instance the player is in, as well
    as for handling various raid-related events and rewards. The method returns an
    integer that represents the current raid difficulty level, with values typically
    ranging from 1 to 3 depending on the specific raid content being accessed. This
    information is crucial for maintaining proper game balance and ensuring players
    are matched with appropriate content based on their difficulty selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the current raid difficulty ID, where 1
    corresponds to normal difficulty, 2 corresponds to heroic difficulty, and 3 corresponds
    to mythic difficulty. The value may also be 0 if no raid is active or if the player
    has not selected a difficulty yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int difficulty = player->GetRaidDifficultyID();\nif (difficulty == 1)\n\
      {\n    // Player is in normal raid\n}\nelse if (difficulty == 2)\n{\n    //\
      \ Player is in heroic raid\n}\nelse if (difficulty == 3)\n{\n    // Player is\
      \ in mythic raid\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other raid-related functions
    to determine player eligibility for specific content. The value returned by this
    method may be updated when the player changes their difficulty selection or enters
    a new raid instance.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may not always reflect
    the actual current raid instance if the player is in a scenario or other non-standard
    raid content. Also, ensure that the player's raid difficulty setting is properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
