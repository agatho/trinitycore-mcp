  signature: bool AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange::operator()(int * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether all creatures of a specified entry are within a given range.
  description: The AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange::operator() method serves as a predicate
    function that determines if every creature in a collection matches a specific
    entry type and is located within a defined distance. This method is typically
    used in AI or event handling systems to check conditions based on creature presence
    and proximity. It operates on an internal set of creatures and returns true if
    all matching creatures are within range, otherwise false. The method does not
    modify any state but evaluates the current set of creatures against specified
    criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether all creatures of the specified
    entry type are within the defined range. True indicates all creatures match the
    criteria; false indicates at least one creature is outside the range or does not
    match the entry type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI condition check
    code: "if (AllCreaturesOfEntryInRange(12345, 50.0f)(nullptr)) {\n    // All creatures\
      \ with entry ID 12345 are within 50 yards\n    DoSomething();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI framework for conditional
    logic. The implementation likely uses internal caching or reference counting to
    efficiently evaluate creature presence without repeatedly querying the world state.
    Performance may be impacted if large numbers of creatures are being evaluated.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry ID and range parameters are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid values could lead to unexpected behavior or performance
    degradation. This predicate should not be used in high-frequency loops without
    proper optimization.
