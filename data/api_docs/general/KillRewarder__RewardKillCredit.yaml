  signature: void KillRewarder::_RewardKillCredit(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Processes kill credit rewards for a player, awarding experience, gold, and
    quest progress.
  description: The _RewardKillCredit method is responsible for handling the reward
    distribution when a player successfully kills a creature or NPC. This includes
    granting experience points, monetary rewards (gold), and updating any associated
    quest objectives that require the player to defeat specific enemies. The method
    typically integrates with the game's core reward systems and ensures proper synchronization
    of player progress within the TrinityCore framework. It is generally invoked internally
    by the game engine upon successful creature kill events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object for whom kill credit rewards are being
      processed. Must be a valid, non-null player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature Kill Event
    code: "void Creature::OnDeath()\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetKillerPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        _RewardKillCredit(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Kill Credit Reward Trigger
    code: "void CustomEvent::HandlePlayerKill(Player* player)\n{\n    // Perform custom\
      \ logic before rewarding\n    if (player && player->IsAlive())\n    {\n    \
      \    _RewardKillCredit(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game engine when a
    player kills a creature. It assumes that the player has already been validated
    as being in a valid state for receiving rewards. The method may perform database
    updates and send reward packets to the client.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with an invalid or null player pointer,
    as it will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player
    is alive and in a valid game state before invoking this method.
