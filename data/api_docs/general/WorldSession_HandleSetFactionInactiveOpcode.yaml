  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleSetFactionInactiveOpcode
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSetFactionInactiveOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::SetFactionInactive
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the faction inactive state for the player's character based on the provided
    packet data.
  description: The HandleSetFactionInactiveOpcode method processes a client request
    to mark a specific faction as inactive in the player's reputation list. This functionality
    allows players to hide certain factions from their character's reputation display,
    effectively making them 'inactive' within the game interface. The method takes
    a WorldPackets::Character::SetFactionInactive packet which contains information
    about which faction should be toggled. This operation affects only the client-side
    display and does not alter the actual reputation values or standings with that
    faction. The method is part of the WorldSession class and handles communication
    between the game client and server for character reputation management.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Character::SetFactionInactive packet
      containing the faction ID and inactive state flag that the client wishes to
      set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleSetFactionInactiveOpcode
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSetFactionInactiveOpcode(WorldPackets::Character::SetFactionInactive&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the packet to update faction inactive state\n \
      \   Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n        return;\n    \n\
      \    // Update the faction's inactive status in the player's reputation\n  \
      \  player->SetFactionInactive(packet.FactionID, packet.Inactive);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player interacts with the reputation
    panel in-game and chooses to hide specific factions. The inactive state is stored
    locally on the client side but also synchronized with the server to maintain consistency.
    This operation does not affect faction-based quest rewards or other gameplay mechanics
    that depend on actual reputation values.
