documentation:
  brief: Updates the map's delayed objects after a specified time interval.
  description: The DelayedUpdate method processes and updates all delayed objects
    on the map, typically used to handle object movement or state changes that need
    to be processed after a certain time period. This method is crucial for maintaining
    proper game mechanics in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing with dynamic
    objects like creatures or game objects that have delayed actions or updates. It
    ensures that objects are properly updated according to their internal timers and
    game logic.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      map->DelayedUpdate(1000);

      // Updates all delayed objects on the map after 1 second'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during game loop processing to ensure that
    delayed objects are updated properly. It's important to note that this method
    may be called from multiple threads, so thread safety considerations should be
    taken into account when implementing or using this method.
