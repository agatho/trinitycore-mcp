  class: SimpleCharmedPlayerAI
  method: SimpleCharmedPlayerAI
  signature: void SimpleCharmedPlayerAI::SimpleCharmedPlayerAI(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a simple charmed player AI with the specified player reference.
  description: The SimpleCharmedPlayerAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for
    a player who is charmed by an NPC. This method sets up internal state to manage
    the player's actions while under charm effects, ensuring proper handling of movement,
    combat, and interaction with the environment. The implementation likely includes
    setting up AI decision-making logic that prioritizes following the charmer or
    executing specific scripted behaviors. It may also initialize tracking variables
    for charm duration, target selection, and state management during the charm effect.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will be controlled by this AI instance.
      Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Charmed Player AI
    code: 'Player* myPlayer = ...; // Assume player is already created

      SimpleCharmedPlayerAI ai(&myPlayer);

      // The AI is now initialized to control the player under charm effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when a player is actually charmed
    by an NPC. The AI behavior assumes that the player object passed in is valid and
    will remain alive for the duration of the charm effect.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the player parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation before calling this constructor.
