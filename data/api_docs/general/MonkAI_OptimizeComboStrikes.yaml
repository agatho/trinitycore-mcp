  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeComboStrikes()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes combo strike usage for a Monk AI by evaluating and selecting the
    most effective combo strike ability based on current game state and resource availability.
  description: The OptimizeComboStrikes method is responsible for determining the
    optimal combo strike ability to use within the Monk AI's combat routine. This
    method evaluates various factors such as available energy, combo points, player
    buffs, debuffs, and target conditions to select the most effective combo strike.
    It ensures that the Monk AI makes intelligent decisions about when and which combo
    strike to execute, maximizing damage output or utility based on the current combat
    situation. The method does not directly execute the ability but rather prepares
    the necessary state for the next combo strike action.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        OptimizeComboStrikes();\n        // ... rest of combat logic\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combo Point Management
    code: "void MonkAI::DoComboStrikeOptimization()\n{\n    if (me->GetPower(POWER_COMBO_POINTS)\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        OptimizeComboStrikes();\n        // Proceed with combo\
      \ strike execution\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked before any combo strike execution logic. It assumes that the Monk's current
    resource state (energy, combo points) has already been evaluated and updated.
    The optimization process considers both immediate damage potential and long-term
    resource efficiency.
  warnings: This method does not perform actual ability casting; it only determines
    which ability should be cast next. Failure to properly integrate this with the
    AI's execution logic may result in incorrect combo strike usage. Ensure that the
    Monk's power state is properly maintained before calling this method.
