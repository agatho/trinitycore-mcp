  class: Quest
  method: GetFlagsEx2
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetFlagsEx2() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the extended flags of the quest, including additional quest properties
    and behaviors.
  description: The GetFlagsEx2 method retrieves the extended flags associated with
    a quest object, which are used to define additional quest properties beyond the
    standard flags. These flags typically include information about quest completion
    conditions, special quest behaviors, and other advanced quest mechanics that are
    not covered by the basic flags. This method is commonly used in quest scripting
    and quest-related logic to determine how a quest should behave or interact with
    players based on its extended configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the extended flags of the quest, which
    can include various combinations of quest-specific properties such as completion
    conditions, special behaviors, or other advanced quest mechanics. The exact meaning
    of each bit in the returned value depends on the specific flag definitions used
    by TrinityCore.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 flags = quest->GetFlagsEx2();\nif (flags & FLAG_EX2_QUEST_COMPLETE)\
      \ {\n    // Quest is marked as complete\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nuint32 flags = quest->GetFlagsEx2();\n\
      if (flags & FLAG_EX2_QUEST_HIDDEN) {\n    // Quest is hidden from player\n}\n\
      else if (flags & FLAG_EX2_QUEST_REPEATABLE) {\n    // Quest can be repeated\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest system's internal structure and should be
    used carefully when modifying or checking quest behavior. The flags returned by
    GetFlagsEx2 are typically defined in the database and may vary depending on the
    specific quest configuration. It is recommended to use this method only when necessary,
    as it can impact performance if used extensively.
  warnings: This method should not be used for direct modification of quest flags;
    instead, it should be used for reading or checking existing flags. Incorrect handling
    of extended flags may lead to unexpected behavior in quest completion or interaction
    with players.
