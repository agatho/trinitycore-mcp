  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::Reload()
documentation:
  brief: Reloads the player bot configuration from the database or file sources
  description: The Reload method refreshes the internal configuration state of the
    Playerbot system by re-reading settings from the database or configuration files.
    This allows for dynamic updates to bot behavior without requiring a server restart.
    The method typically checks for changes in bot settings, AI parameters, and behavioral
    rules that may have been modified externally. It ensures that all active player
    bots will use the most recent configuration values immediately after calling this
    method.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the configuration was successfully reloaded and applied;
    returns false if the reload operation failed or was unable to update the configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reload Usage
    code: "if (playerbotConfig->Reload()) {\n    // Configuration successfully reloaded\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player bot configuration reloaded successfully.\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Failed to reload configuration\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to reload player bot configuration.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during runtime when administrators want to
    apply updated bot settings without restarting the server. It may involve database
    queries or file I/O operations depending on how the configuration is stored and
    managed.
