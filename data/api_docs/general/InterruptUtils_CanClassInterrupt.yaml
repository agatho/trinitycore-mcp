documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player class can interrupt spell casting.
  description: The CanClassInterrupt method checks if a given player class is capable
    of interrupting ongoing spell casts. This functionality is crucial for game mechanics
    involving spell interruption, such as when a player is stunned or when certain
    abilities are used to break spellcasting. The method evaluates the class type
    against a predefined set of classes that are allowed to perform spell interruptions.
    It typically returns true for classes known to have interruption capabilities
    (such as warriors with specific talents) and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player class can interrupt spells, false
    otherwise. The method evaluates the input parameter against a list of supported
    classes that are permitted to interrupt spell casts in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Warrior Class Can Interrupt
    code: "if (InterruptUtils::CanClassInterrupt(CLASS_WARRIOR)) {\n    // Warrior\
      \ can interrupt spells\n    printf(\"Warrior can interrupt spells\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal class definitions and may be used in
    conjunction with spell interruption logic. It's important to note that the specific
    classes allowed to interrupt may vary based on game updates or expansions.
