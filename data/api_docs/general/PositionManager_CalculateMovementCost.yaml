documentation:
  brief: Calculates the movement cost between two positions in the game world.
  description: The CalculateMovementCost method computes the cost associated with
    moving from one position to another within the TrinityCore game world. This cost
    is typically used for pathfinding algorithms, movement validation, or determining
    resource consumption for character movement. The method takes two integer parameters
    representing identifiers for source and destination positions, which may correspond
    to waypoints, grid coordinates, or node indices in a navigation graph. The returned
    float value represents the relative cost of traversal between these points, factoring
    in terrain, obstacles, and other environmental factors that affect movement.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: An integer identifier representing the starting position or node
      index for movement calculation.
  - name: to
    description: An integer identifier representing the destination position or node
      index for movement calculation.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated movement cost between the specified
    positions. Lower values indicate easier traversal, while higher values suggest
    more difficult or costly movement paths.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Cost Calculation
    code: 'PositionManager positionMgr;

      int startNode = 100;

      int endNode = 105;

      float cost = positionMgr.CalculateMovementCost(startNode, endNode);

      // cost now contains the movement cost between nodes 100 and 105'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Movement Cost in Pathfinding
    code: "PositionManager positionMgr;\nstd::vector<int> path = {1, 3, 7, 9};\nfloat\
      \ totalCost = 0.0f;\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < path.size() - 1; ++i) {\n    totalCost\
      \ += positionMgr.CalculateMovementCost(path[i], path[i+1]);\n}\n// totalCost\
      \ now represents the cumulative movement cost along the entire path"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal pathfinding data structures and may cache
    results for performance. The exact implementation details depend on how positions
    are stored and indexed within the PositionManager class. It is recommended to
    ensure that the 'from' and 'to' parameters refer to valid positions in the system
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: The method assumes that both input parameters represent valid positions
    in the game world. Passing invalid indices or out-of-bounds values may lead to
    incorrect calculations or runtime errors. Ensure proper validation of position
    identifiers before calling this method.
