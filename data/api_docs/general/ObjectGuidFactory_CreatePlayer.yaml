  class: ObjectGuidFactory
  method: CreatePlayer
  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreatePlayer(uint32 realmId, uint64 dbId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique ObjectGuid for a player using the specified realm and database
    ID.
  description: The CreatePlayer method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    for a player entity within the TrinityCore framework. This GUID is constructed
    using the provided realm identifier and database ID to ensure global uniqueness
    across the game world. The resulting ObjectGuid can be used to reference the player
    in various game systems, such as object tracking, network communication, and database
    operations. The method typically serves as part of the core object management
    system where player entities are initialized and assigned their identifying markers.
  parameters:
  - name: realmId
    description: The unique identifier of the realm where the player resides. This
      value determines which realm-specific namespace the GUID belongs to.
  - name: dbId
    description: The database identifier for the player record. This ID is typically
      obtained from the player's entry in the database and ensures uniqueness within
      the realm.
  returns: An ObjectGuid object representing the unique identifier for the specified
    player. The returned GUID follows TrinityCore's standard format with realm and
    entity type information embedded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player GUID Creation
    code: 'ObjectGuid playerGuid = guidFactory.CreatePlayer(1, 123456);

      // Creates a GUID for player with DB ID 123456 in realm 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Created GUID in Player Context
    code: 'uint32 realmId = sWorld->GetRealmID();

      uint64 dbId = player->GetDBId();

      ObjectGuid guid = guidFactory.CreatePlayer(realmId, dbId);

      player->SetGUID(guid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectGuidFactory class which manages all GUID
    generation for game objects. The generated GUIDs are designed to be globally unique
    across realms and entities. Developers should ensure that realmId and dbId parameters
    are valid and correspond to existing realm and player records respectively.
  warnings: Incorrect realm or database IDs may result in invalid or non-unique GUIDs,
    potentially causing issues with object tracking or network synchronization. Always
    validate input parameters before calling this method.
