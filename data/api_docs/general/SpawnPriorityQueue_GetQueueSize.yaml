  signature: size_t SpawnPriorityQueue::GetQueueSize(SpawnPriority priority) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of spawns queued for a specific priority level
  description: The GetQueueSize method retrieves the current count of spawn requests
    that are pending execution within the SpawnPriorityQueue for a given priority
    level. This method is used to monitor queue lengths and manage spawn scheduling
    in TrinityCore's creature and game object spawning system. The returned size indicates
    how many objects are waiting to be spawned at the specified priority, which helps
    in load balancing and performance optimization of the server's spawn management
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of queued spawns for the specified
    priority level. Returns 0 if no spawns are queued for that priority or if the
    priority is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check queue size for high priority spawns
    code: "SpawnPriorityQueue queue;\nsize_t highPrioritySize = queue.GetQueueSize(SpawnPriority::HIGH);\n\
      if (highPrioritySize > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"High priority queue has \" <<\
      \ highPrioritySize << \" items\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for monitoring and debugging spawn queue behavior.
    The implementation likely uses a map or similar data structure to track counts
    per priority level, making the operation O(1) for retrieving the size of a specific
    priority's queue.
