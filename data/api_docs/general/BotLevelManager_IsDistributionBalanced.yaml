documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot level distribution across players is balanced
    according to configured thresholds.
  description: The IsDistributionBalanced method evaluates the current distribution
    of bot levels among connected players to determine if it meets the defined balance
    criteria. This method is typically used in automated systems that manage bot deployment
    and leveling to ensure fair play and prevent extreme disparities in player power
    levels. The check considers factors such as average level differences, variance
    in level distributions, and configured tolerance thresholds. It returns true if
    the distribution is considered balanced based on these criteria, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the bot level distribution is
    considered balanced. True indicates that the current distribution meets the balance
    criteria, while false indicates that the distribution is unbalanced or exceeds
    configured thresholds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botLevelManager.IsDistributionBalanced()) {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ bot operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot level distribution is balanced.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Trigger rebalancing logic\n    LOG_WARN(\"bot\", \"Bot\
      \ level distribution is unbalanced, initiating rebalance.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs statistical analysis on the current bot population
    to determine if their levels are evenly distributed across players. The exact
    algorithm for determining balance may depend on configuration settings such as
    maximum level variance or tolerance thresholds.
