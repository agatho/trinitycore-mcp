  signature: bool ObjectMgr::DeleteGameTele(std::string_view name)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a game teleport location from the database by its name.
  description: The DeleteGameTele method removes a game teleport location entry from
    the database using the specified location name. This function is typically used
    to delete custom teleport coordinates that were added via the AddGameTele command
    or similar mechanisms. The method performs a lookup in the game_tele table and
    deletes the corresponding record if found. It returns true upon successful deletion,
    or false if the specified teleport location does not exist. This operation directly
    affects the in-game teleport system and should be used carefully to avoid breaking
    existing teleport configurations.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The name of the game teleport location to delete. This corresponds
      to the 'name' field in the game_tele database table.
  returns: True if the teleport location was successfully found and deleted from the
    database; false if no matching teleport location with the given name exists.
  examples:
  - title: Delete a custom teleport location
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->DeleteGameTele(\"MyCustomLocation\"))\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Successfully deleted teleport location 'MyCustomLocation'\");\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Teleport location 'MyCustomLocation' not found\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and may have performance
    implications if called frequently. It's recommended to use this function only
    when necessary, as it involves database operations. The method assumes that the
    provided name is valid and exists in the game_tele table.
  warnings: Deleting a teleport location that is referenced by other systems or scripts
    may cause errors or unexpected behavior in the game. Always verify that no other
    components depend on the location before deletion. This function does not perform
    any validation of dependencies.
