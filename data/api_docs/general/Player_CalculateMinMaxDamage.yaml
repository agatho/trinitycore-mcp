documentation:
  brief: Calculates minimum and maximum damage values for a player's weapon based
    on attack type and modifiers.
  description: This method computes the minimum and maximum damage values for a player's
    weapon, taking into account various factors such as weapon type, attack type,
    and modifiers. It is used internally by the game engine to determine damage ranges
    for attacks. The method considers different attack types (melee, ranged, spell)
    and applies appropriate calculations based on the player's level, equipment, and
    other factors. This function is essential for determining combat outcomes during
    attacks and is typically called during attack calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: attType
    description: The type of attack (melee, ranged, or spell) to calculate damage
      for. Valid values are 0 (melee), 1 (ranged), or 2 (spell).
  - name: normalized
    description: Whether to normalize the damage calculation. If true, damage is normalized
      based on weapon type and player level; if false, damage is calculated without
      normalization.
  - name: addTotalPct
    description: Whether to add percentage modifiers to the final damage calculation.
      If true, percentage modifiers are added to the calculated damage values.
  - name: minDamage
    description: Reference to the minimum damage value that will be calculated by
      this method.
  - name: maxDamage
    description: Reference to the maximum damage value that will be calculated by
      this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player;

      float minDmg, maxDmg;

      player->CalculateMinMaxDamage(0, true, false, minDmg, maxDmg);

      // minDmg and maxDmg now contain calculated damage values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player;

      float minDmg, maxDmg;

      player->CalculateMinMaxDamage(2, false, true, minDmg, maxDmg);

      // Calculates spell damage with percentage modifiers added'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat calculations and should be
    used carefully as it involves complex calculations based on player's level, equipment,
    and weapon type. Performance considerations include the fact that this method
    may involve multiple calculations depending on the attack type and modifiers applied.
  warnings: The method requires careful handling of references to minDamage and maxDamage
    values as they are modified in place. Incorrect usage could lead to inaccurate
    damage calculations which might affect combat outcomes.
