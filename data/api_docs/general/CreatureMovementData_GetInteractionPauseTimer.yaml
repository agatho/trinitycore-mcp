  class: CreatureMovementData
  method: GetInteractionPauseTimer
  signature: uint32 CreatureMovementData::GetInteractionPauseTimer() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interaction pause timer value for the creature movement data.
  description: The GetInteractionPauseTimer method returns the current pause duration,
    in milliseconds, that a creature will wait before resuming movement after an interaction
    event. This timer is used to control the timing of creature behavior during scripted
    events, player interactions, or AI decision-making processes. The returned value
    represents how much time remains (or has passed) in the pause state, which can
    be used by the AI system to determine when to proceed with next actions. This
    method is typically called during movement updates or interaction handling routines
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the interaction pause timer in milliseconds.
    If the timer is not active or has completed, this value may be zero or indicate
    a specific state depending on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (CreatureMovementData* movementData = me->GetCreatureMovementData())\n\
      \        {\n            uint32 pauseTimer = movementData->GetInteractionPauseTimer();\n\
      \            if (pauseTimer == 0)\n            {\n                // Proceed\
      \ with normal movement logic\n                DoNormalMovement();\n        \
      \    }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CreatureMovementData class and should only be
    called when the creature has valid movement data assigned. The timer value may
    be modified by other systems during runtime, so calling this method multiple times
    in quick succession might return different values.
