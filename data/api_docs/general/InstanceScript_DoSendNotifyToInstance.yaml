  signature: void InstanceScript::DoSendNotifyToInstance(const char * format)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a formatted notification message to all players within the instance
  description: The DoSendNotifyToInstance method sends a localized notification message
    to every player currently present in the instance. This method is commonly used
    for broadcasting important game events, warnings, or updates to all players in
    a dungeon, raid, or scenario. The message is formatted using the standard printf-style
    formatting and is displayed as a system message to players. The method operates
    on the instance's context, ensuring that only players within the specific instance
    receive the notification, making it ideal for instance-specific communications
    without affecting other areas of the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: format
    description: A printf-style format string specifying the message to be sent. This
      string can include format specifiers like %s, %d, %f, etc., which will be replaced
      by subsequent arguments when the method is called with additional parameters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage sending a simple message
    code: "void BossAI::JustDied()\n{\n    instance->DoSendNotifyToInstance(\"The\
      \ boss has been defeated!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with formatted arguments for dynamic content
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    DoSendNotifyToInstance(\"\
      Welcome to the instance, %s!\", player->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed specifically for instance-based notifications and
    automatically handles the scope of players within the current instance. It's recommended
    to use this method instead of sending global messages to avoid cluttering other
    areas of the game world with instance-specific information.
