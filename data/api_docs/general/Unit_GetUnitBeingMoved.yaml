  signature: Unit * Unit::GetUnitBeingMoved() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit that is currently being moved by this unit.
  description: This method retrieves the Unit object that is currently being moved
    by the calling unit. It is typically used in movement-related contexts where a
    unit needs to know which other unit is performing the movement actions. The method
    returns a pointer to the Unit being moved, which can be null if no movement is
    currently active or if the unit is not actively moving another unit. This functionality
    is essential for understanding movement mechanics and tracking unit interactions
    during movement operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit object that is being moved by this unit.
    If no movement is occurring or if the unit is not actively moving another unit,
    the method may return nullptr. The returned pointer represents the target of movement
    operations and can be used to access properties of the unit being moved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = this->GetUnitBeingMoved();\nif (target != nullptr)\n{\n\
      \    // Use target for further processing\n    // Example: target->GetDisplayId();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in movement-related code and requires careful
    handling when dealing with units that might be null or have different movement
    states. Performance considerations should include checking for null pointers before
    using the returned unit object.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return nullptr if no movement
    is currently active. Also, ensure proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded
    environments, as movement state can change rapidly during gameplay.
