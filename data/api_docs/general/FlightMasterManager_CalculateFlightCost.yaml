  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: CalculateFlightCost
  signature: uint32 FlightMasterManager::CalculateFlightCost(const TaxiNodesEntry
    * from, const TaxiNodesEntry * to) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the cost of a flight between two taxi nodes in the World of Warcraft
    game.
  description: The CalculateFlightCost method determines the gold cost required for
    a player to travel from one taxi node to another within the game's flight system.
    This calculation is based on the distance between the nodes, the player's current
    location, and various in-game factors such as faction, reputation, and any applicable
    discounts or taxes. The method returns a uint32 value representing the total cost
    in copper coins (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold). This function is
    typically invoked when a player attempts to use a flight path, either through
    the taxi master interface or by selecting a destination from the flight map. The
    method does not modify any internal state and is purely a calculation utility.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry structure representing the starting
      taxi node for the flight path.
  - name: to
    description: Pointer to the TaxiNodesEntry structure representing the destination
      taxi node for the flight path.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value indicating the total cost in copper coins required
    to travel from the 'from' node to the 'to' node. A return value of 0 typically
    indicates that the flight is free or that an error occurred during calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Cost Calculation
    code: "const TaxiNodesEntry* startNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      const TaxiNodesEntry* endNode = sTaxiNodesStore.LookupEntry(5678);\nuint32 cost\
      \ = flightMasterManager.CalculateFlightCost(startNode, endNode);\nif (cost >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player can afford the flight\n    printf(\"Flight cost: %u copper\\\
      n\", cost);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Flight is free or invalid\n    printf(\"Flight\
      \ is free or invalid\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal taxi node database and assumes valid TaxiNodesEntry
    pointers. The actual cost calculation may vary depending on player's faction,
    quest completion status, and other in-game modifiers. It is recommended to validate
    that both nodes are not null before calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'from' and 'to' parameters point to valid entries in
    the taxi node database; passing invalid or null pointers may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. The returned value should be interpreted as copper
    coins, which can be converted to silver/gold for display purposes.
