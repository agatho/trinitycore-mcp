  class: ShadowDanceTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool ShadowDanceTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Shadow Dance ability is currently active on the player.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Shadow Dance ability, a talent
    available to Shadow Priests, is currently active. This ability grants increased
    damage and critical strike chance for a set duration. The method typically checks
    internal state flags or timers associated with the ability's activation. It does
    not modify any game state but provides read-only access to the current status
    of the ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Shadow Dance ability is currently active, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the player has the ability applied and its effects are currently
    in effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (shadowDanceTracker->IsActive()) {\n    // Perform actions while Shadow\
      \ Dance is active\n    player->CastSpell(target, SHADOW_DANCE_DAMAGE_BUFF, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Active Check
    code: "if (!shadowDanceTracker->IsActive()) {\n    // Shadow Dance is not active,\
      \ so we can apply it\n    player->CastSpell(player, SHADOW_DANCE_SPELL, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Shadow Dance is already active, skip casting\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Shadow Dance is already active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of the ability's duration
    timer or aura state. It should be called frequently during combat to ensure accurate
    status checks, especially when determining whether to apply other abilities that
    may interact with Shadow Dance.
  warnings: Do not assume that calling this method will provide real-time updates
    if used outside of a combat context where the ability's activation is actively
    monitored. The result may reflect stale data if not properly synchronized with
    game state changes.
