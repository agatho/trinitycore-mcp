  method: CheckAchievementCriteriaMeet
  signature: bool InstanceScript::CheckAchievementCriteriaMeet(uint32 param0, const
    Player * param1, const Unit * param2, uint32 param3)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if an achievement criteria is met based on provided parameters.
  description: The CheckAchievementCriteriaMeet method evaluates whether a specific
    achievement criterion has been fulfilled within the instance. It takes into account
    various factors such as player actions, unit interactions, and contextual data
    to determine if the criteria for a given achievement are satisfied. This method
    is typically invoked during gameplay events or when checking progress toward completing
    achievements. The parameters provide context about the triggering event, including
    the involved player, target unit, and relevant data associated with the achievement
    check.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The criteria ID or type that defines what condition needs to be checked
      for the achievement.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to the Player object who is being evaluated against the achievement
      criteria.
  - name: param2
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that may be involved in the criteria check,
      such as a killed mob or interacted NPC.
  - name: param3
    description: Additional data field that can provide contextual information for
      the achievement check, such as kill count or specific value thresholds.
  returns: Returns true if the specified achievement criteria has been met based on
    the provided parameters; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Criteria Check
    code: "if (instanceScript->CheckAchievementCriteriaMeet(12345, player, targetUnit,\
      \ 1))\n{\n    // Criteria met, proceed with achievement logic\n    player->CompletedAchievement(67890);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Achievement Criteria Check with Conditional Logic
    code: "uint32 criteriaId = 54321;\nPlayer* currentPlayer = player;\nUnit* target\
      \ = unit;\nuint32 extraData = 5;\n\nif (instanceScript->CheckAchievementCriteriaMeet(criteriaId,\
      \ currentPlayer, target, extraData))\n{\n    // Perform additional checks or\
      \ trigger related events\n    if (currentPlayer->GetTeam() == ALLIANCE)\n  \
      \      currentPlayer->CastSpell(currentPlayer, 123456, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance script system in TrinityCore and is used
    extensively for tracking achievement progress. Developers should ensure that all
    parameters are valid before calling this function to prevent unexpected behavior
    or crashes. The implementation relies on internal logic defined by the achievement
    system and may vary depending on the specific achievement type being checked.
  warnings: Ensure that Player and Unit pointers passed into this method are not null,
    as dereferencing invalid pointers can lead to crashes. Also, be cautious when
    using extra data fields since incorrect values might cause false positives or
    negatives in criteria evaluation.
