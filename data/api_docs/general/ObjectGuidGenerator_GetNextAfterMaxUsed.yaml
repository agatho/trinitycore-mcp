  signature: ObjectGuid::LowType ObjectGuidGenerator::GetNextAfterMaxUsed() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the next available low GUID value after the maximum used GUID in
    the generator's range.
  description: The GetNextAfterMaxUsed method retrieves the next sequential low GUID
    value that can be assigned, starting from the highest currently used GUID plus
    one. This method is typically used in object ID generation systems where unique
    identifiers must be allocated without gaps or conflicts. In TrinityCore's context,
    this is often employed when assigning new GUIDs to entities such as players, creatures,
    game objects, or items. The returned value represents a valid low GUID that has
    not yet been assigned and can be safely used for creating new objects within the
    game world. This method does not modify internal state but provides a read-only
    view of the next available ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: The next available ObjectGuid::LowType value after the maximum used GUID
    in the generator's range. This value is guaranteed to be unique and unused within
    the current generation cycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get next GUID
    code: 'ObjectGuidGenerator guidGen;

      // Assume some IDs have already been used

      ObjectGuid::LowType nextId = guidGen.GetNextAfterMaxUsed();

      printf("Next available GUID: %u\n", nextId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GUID generation logic
    to ensure sequential allocation. It assumes that the internal state of the generator
    maintains a record of the maximum used GUID. This function is generally not thread-safe
    and should be protected by appropriate synchronization mechanisms when accessed
    from multiple threads.
  warnings: Using this method without proper synchronization in multi-threaded environments
    may lead to race conditions where multiple threads attempt to allocate the same
    GUID. Additionally, if the generator's internal state becomes corrupted or inconsistent,
    this method may return incorrect values.
