documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot spawn event bus state based on the elapsed time since last
    update
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing bot spawn
    events within the TrinityCore framework. It handles the timing logic for spawning
    and despawning AI-controlled bots, ensuring that spawn conditions are evaluated
    at appropriate intervals. This method typically integrates with the game's main
    update loop to maintain consistent bot behavior and resource management. The implementation
    likely checks for spawn timers, event triggers, and state transitions while maintaining
    synchronization with the server's tick rate.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    botSpawnEventBus.Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop with appropriate
    time deltas. The implementation may involve internal state tracking and timer
    management for bot spawning events.
