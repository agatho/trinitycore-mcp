  method: ProcessZoneUpdate
  signature: void SpatialHostileCache::ProcessZoneUpdate(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the spatial hostile cache for a specified zone, recalculating and
    refreshing hostile unit positions and visibility.
  description: The ProcessZoneUpdate method is responsible for updating the internal
    spatial cache that tracks hostile units within a specific zone. This method ensures
    that the game's spatial awareness system maintains accurate information about
    which hostile units are present in a given zone, including their positions, visibility
    states, and interaction data. It is typically invoked when zone-related events
    occur, such as player movement between zones or zone-specific updates. The method
    performs calculations to determine which units should be considered hostile within
    the specified zone and refreshes relevant caches to maintain game state consistency.
    This functionality is crucial for proper AI behavior, combat detection, and spatial
    awareness in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to update. This value corresponds
      to the Zone ID used internally by TrinityCore to identify different geographical
      areas in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Update Call
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache;

      cache.ProcessZoneUpdate(1234); // Updates hostile cache for zone with ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Zones
    code: "SpatialHostileCache cache;\nstd::vector<uint32> zones = {1234, 5678, 9012};\n\
      for (uint32 zone : zones)\n{\n    cache.ProcessZoneUpdate(zone);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during zone transition events or periodic
    updates. The implementation may involve locking internal data structures to ensure
    thread safety. Performance can be impacted when processing large numbers of hostile
    units in a zone, especially in high-traffic areas.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid zone ID may result in undefined behavior
    or cache corruption. Ensure that the zone ID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    zone before calling this method.
