documentation:
  brief: Sends a time zone information packet to the client
  description: The SendSetTimeZoneInformation method is responsible for transmitting
    the server's current time zone settings to the connected World of Warcraft client.
    This ensures that the client displays correct local time and handles time-related
    game mechanics appropriately. The method typically sends a TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION
    structure containing daylight saving time settings, bias, and other time zone
    data. It is usually invoked during session initialization or when time zone changes
    occur on the server side.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePlayerLogin(WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n    //\
      \ ... other login logic ...\n    SendSetTimeZoneInformation();\n    // ... rest\
      \ of login process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically during session establishment
    and should not be invoked manually in most cases. The time zone data sent is derived
    from the server's system time zone settings, which may differ from the player's
    actual geographic location.
