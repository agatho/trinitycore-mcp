  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: ProcessBatchSelection
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::ProcessBatchSelection(const int & requests,
    std::function<void (int)> callback)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a batch selection of bot characters using the provided request
    count and callback function.
  description: The ProcessBatchSelection method handles the selection logic for multiple
    bot characters in a single operation. It takes a reference to an integer representing
    the number of requests and a callback function that will be invoked with each
    processed character's ID. This method is typically used within the context of
    automated bot management systems where bulk operations on bot characters are required.
    The implementation likely iterates through available bots, applies selection criteria,
    and executes the provided callback for each selected character.
  parameters:
  - name: requests
    description: A constant reference to an integer specifying the number of bot character
      selection requests to process.
  - name: callback
    description: A std::function object that accepts an integer parameter representing
      the ID of a selected bot character. This function is called once for each character
      processed during the batch operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int requestCount = 5;\nBotCharacterSelector selector;\nselector.ProcessBatchSelection(requestCount,\
      \ [](int botId) {\n    std::cout << \"Selected bot ID: \" << botId << std::endl;\n\
      });"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int requestCount = 10;\nBotCharacterSelector selector;\nselector.ProcessBatchSelection(requestCount,\
      \ [](int botId) {\n    if (botId > 0) {\n        // Process valid bot ID\n \
      \       std::cout << \"Processing bot: \" << botId << std::endl;\n    } else\
      \ {\n        // Handle invalid bot ID\n        std::cerr << \"Invalid bot ID\
      \ encountered\" << std::endl;\n    }\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be efficient for batch operations and should not
    block the calling thread. The callback function may be invoked synchronously or
    asynchronously depending on internal implementation details. Developers should
    ensure that the callback function handles potential errors gracefully.
  warnings: Ensure that the callback function does not perform long-running operations
    as it may impact performance of the overall selection process. Be cautious when
    using this method in multithreaded environments without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
