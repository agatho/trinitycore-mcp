  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetPlayerProfessions
  signature: int ProfessionManager::GetPlayerProfessions(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of professions known by the player.
  description: The GetPlayerProfessions method retrieves a list of all professions
    currently known by the specified player. This method is typically used in the
    context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to query a player's
    skill tree and profession data. The returned integer represents the number of
    professions found, and the player parameter is expected to be a pointer to an
    integer identifier (likely a GUID) that uniquely identifies the target player.
    This functionality is essential for systems that need to track or modify player
    profession data, such as crafting systems, quest progression, or character customization
    features.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer identifier representing the player's unique
      GUID. The method uses this value to locate and retrieve the specified player's
      profession data.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of professions found for the specified
    player. A return value of 0 indicates that no professions were found or that the
    player could not be located. Negative values may indicate errors in the lookup
    process or invalid player identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nint professionCount = professionManager.GetPlayerProfessions(&playerId);\n\
      if (professionCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Player has \" << professionCount\
      \ << \" professions.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No professions\
      \ found or player not found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nint result = professionManager.GetPlayerProfessions(&playerId);\n\
      if (result < 0) {\n    // Handle error condition\n    std::cerr << \"Failed\
      \ to retrieve professions for player ID: \" << playerId << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ if (result == 0) {\n    // Player exists but has no professions\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player found but has no professions.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Success case - result contains number of professions\n    std::cout << \"\
      Found \" << result << \" professions for player.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal player data structures and
    may involve database lookups or cached data access. Performance considerations
    should be taken into account when calling this method frequently, especially in
    high-frequency systems like crafting or quest progression checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the player identifier passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing player in the database. Passing invalid or uninitialized pointers
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that the player
    data is already loaded into memory or accessible through the server's internal
    systems.
