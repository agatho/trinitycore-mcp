  brief: Sends a custom animation to the GameObject's owner.
  description: This method triggers a custom animation on the GameObject, which is
    typically used for visual effects or special actions. The animation ID parameter
    determines what specific animation is displayed. This method is commonly used
    in conjunction with game object events or quest scripts to provide visual feedback
    to players when interacting with the object. The animation will be sent to the
    owner of the GameObject, usually a player or NPC.

    code: GameObject->SendCustomAnim(1234);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in event handling or quest scripts where a custom
    animation needs to be triggered on a GameObject. It's important to note that the
    animation ID must be valid and correspond to an existing animation in the game
    database.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly from player interaction scripts
    without proper validation, as invalid animation IDs can cause client-side errors
    or crashes.
