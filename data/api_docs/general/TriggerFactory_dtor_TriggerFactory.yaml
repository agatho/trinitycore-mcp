  method: ~TriggerFactory
  signature: void TriggerFactory::~TriggerFactory()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the TriggerFactory instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~TriggerFactory destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated by the TriggerFactory class. This includes releasing any
    dynamically allocated trigger objects, clearing internal data structures, and
    ensuring no memory leaks occur when the factory object goes out of scope. In the
    context of TrinityCore's AI and event system, this destructor ensures proper cleanup
    of trigger mechanisms that may have been registered or instantiated during the
    lifetime of the factory. The method is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime
    when a TriggerFactory object is destroyed, such as when it goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'TriggerFactory* factory = new TriggerFactory();

      // ... use the factory ...

      delete factory; // This automatically calls ~TriggerFactory()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-Allocated Factory Cleanup
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    TriggerFactory factory;\n    // ... use factory\
      \ ...\n    // ~TriggerFactory() called automatically when factory goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all triggers created through this
    factory are properly cleaned up before the factory itself is destroyed to prevent
    dangling references or memory leaks.
