  signature: bool MistweaverReNewingMistTracker::HasReNewingMist(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Renewing Mist buff active.
  description: The HasReNewingMist method determines whether a specific player currently
    has the Renewing Mist buff applied to them. This is a key mechanic in the Mistweaver
    class specialization, where Renewing Mist provides periodic healing over time.
    The method uses the player's GUID to identify and check the buff status. It typically
    returns true if the buff is active and false otherwise. This functionality is
    essential for various gameplay mechanics such as determining eligibility for certain
    abilities or calculating damage/healing multipliers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player has the Renewing Mist buff active,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (tracker->HasReNewingMist(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player has Renewing\
      \ Mist active\n    // Apply additional effects or calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Healing Logic
    code: "void ApplyHealingEffect(Unit* target) {\n    if (tracker->HasReNewingMist(target->GetGUID().GetCounter()))\
      \ {\n        // Increase healing amount by 20% due to Renewing Mist\n      \
      \  float baseHeal = 100.0f;\n        float enhancedHeal = baseHeal * 1.2f;\n\
      \        target->CastSpell(target, SPELL_RENEWING_MIST_ENHANCED_HEAL, true);\n\
      \    } else {\n        target->CastSpell(target, SPELL_RENEWING_MIST_HEAL, true);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in an internal data structure that tracks
    active buffs for players. The GUID parameter should be a valid player identifier
    from the TrinityCore system. Performance is generally good as it's a simple lookup
    operation, but frequent calls may impact performance in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method corresponds to a valid player
    entity; passing invalid or non-player GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or
    incorrect results. This method should not be called on creatures or game objects.
