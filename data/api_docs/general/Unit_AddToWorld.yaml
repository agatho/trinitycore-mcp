  brief: Adds the unit to the world, making it visible to other players and creatures.
  description: The AddToWorld method is responsible for inserting a Unit object into
    the global world container, allowing it to be processed by the game world system.
    This method ensures that the unit becomes visible and accessible to other entities
    in the game world, such as players and NPCs. It typically involves adding the
    unit to the appropriate spatial partitioning systems and updating its visibility
    status within the world context. The method is commonly called during object creation
    or when a unit needs to be made visible after being hidden.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per unit instance. Calling it multiple
    times can lead to memory leaks or duplicate entries in the world container. The
    method is typically invoked during initialization or when a unit needs to be made
    visible.
  warnings: Calling AddToWorld on an already added unit can cause duplicate entries
    and potential memory issues. Always ensure that the unit has not been previously
    added before calling this method.
