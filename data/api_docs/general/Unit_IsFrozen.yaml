  class: Unit
  method: IsFrozen
  signature: bool Unit::IsFrozen() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is frozen and cannot move or perform actions.
  description: The IsFrozen method determines whether a unit is currently in a frozen
    state, preventing movement and action execution. This status typically occurs
    when a unit is affected by freeze effects such as ice block or similar mechanics.
    The method returns true when the unit is frozen and false otherwise, indicating
    that the unit can perform actions normally. This check is essential for determining
    whether a unit's movement or ability usage is restricted.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is frozen and cannot move or perform actions,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsFrozen())\n{\n    // Unit is frozen, do not allow movement\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Unit can move normally\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine whether a unit's
    actions are restricted due to freeze effects. It may be called during combat or
    when evaluating unit status.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a unit is immune to movement
    restrictions, as there may be other conditions that prevent movement, such as
    root effects or similar.
