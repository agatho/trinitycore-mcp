  method: HasNearbyResources
  signature: bool GatheringManager::HasNearbyResources() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if there are any gatherable resources within the specified proximity
    of the player.
  description: The HasNearbyResources method determines whether there are any valid
    gathering resources (such as herbs, ore veins, or mining nodes) located within
    a defined radius around the player character. This method is typically used by
    the game's gathering system to decide whether to display interactive prompts or
    enable gathering actions. It performs a spatial query against the world environment
    to locate nearby GameObjects that are marked as gatherable resources. The check
    considers both the physical distance and the resource's availability state, ensuring
    only active and accessible resources are counted.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one valid gatherable resource is found within
    the detection range; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a gathering handler
    code: "if (player->GetGatheringManager()->HasNearbyResources()) {\n    // Display\
      \ gathering prompt or enable interaction\n    player->SendGatherablePrompt();\n\
      } else {\n    // No resources nearby, hide prompt\n    player->HideGatherablePrompt();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial partitioning or octree-based queries for
    performance optimization when scanning the world for resources. It may cache results
    temporarily to avoid repeated expensive lookups during a single game tick.
