  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: CalculateFarmingDuration
  signature: uint32 FarmingCoordinator::CalculateFarmingDuration(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the duration in seconds required for a player to complete a farming
    profession task.
  description: The CalculateFarmingDuration method determines how long it takes for
    a player to finish a farming-related activity based on their current profession
    level and other relevant factors. This method is typically used within the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to manage resource gathering
    mechanics such as mining, herbalism, or farming. The calculation considers the
    player's skill level, the type of profession being performed, and potentially
    environmental or equipment modifiers. It returns a value representing the time
    in seconds needed to complete the task.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the system. This parameter is used to retrieve player-specific data such
      as skill level and profession information.
  - name: profession
    description: An enum value of type ProfessionType indicating which farming profession
      is being calculated. Valid values include types like MINING, HERBALISM, FARMING,
      etc., depending on the game's profession system.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the duration in seconds required to complete
    the farming task for the specified player and profession. Returns 0 if invalid
    inputs are provided or if no calculation can be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionType prof = FARMING;

      uint32 duration = coordinator.CalculateFarmingDuration(&playerId, prof);

      // duration now contains the time in seconds needed to complete the farming
      task'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int* playerPtr = getPlayerPointer();\nif (playerPtr != nullptr) {\n   \
      \ uint32 duration = coordinator.CalculateFarmingDuration(playerPtr, HERBALISM);\n\
      \    if (duration > 0) {\n        // Proceed with farming logic\n        printf(\"\
      Farming will take %u seconds\\n\", duration);\n    } else {\n        // Handle\
      \ invalid or zero-duration case\n        printf(\"Invalid farming calculation\\\
      n\");\n    }\n} else {\n    printf(\"Player pointer is null\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player data structures and profession
    tracking systems. It may be called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    optimization is important. The actual calculation logic might involve randomization
    or scaling based on server settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed in is valid and points to a legitimate
    player object; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Also, make sure the profession
    type is one of the supported values to avoid unexpected results.
