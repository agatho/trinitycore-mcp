documentation:
  brief: Returns the emote ID for incomplete quest completion.
  description: This method retrieves the emote ID associated with incomplete quest
    completion, which is used to trigger specific animations or actions when a player
    has not yet completed a quest. The returned emote ID typically corresponds to
    an animation that occurs when the player's quest progress does not match the required
    conditions for completion. This method is commonly used in conjunction with quest-related
    mechanics to ensure proper game behavior and visual feedback during quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the emote ID associated with incomplete quest
    completion, typically used to trigger animations or actions when the player's
    quest progress does not match required conditions for completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 emoteId = quest->GetIncompleteEmote();\n// Use emoteId to trigger\
      \ specific animation\nif (emoteId > 0)\n{\n    // Perform action with emote\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest completion checks
    and may return zero if no incomplete emote exists for the current quest. Implementation
    details may vary based on how quest data is stored internally.
  warnings: This method should not be called during quest completion validation as
    it may interfere with proper quest progression handling. The returned value might
    be zero if no incomplete emote is defined for the quest.
