  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetHunterOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive cooldowns currently active for a hunter
    player.
  description: The GetHunterOffensiveCooldowns method is used within the PvPCombatAI
    class to determine how many offensive abilities are currently on cooldown for
    a specific hunter player. This functionality is crucial in PvP scenarios where
    managing cooldowns can significantly impact combat effectiveness and strategy.
    The method takes a pointer to a player object and returns an integer representing
    the count of active offensive cooldowns. It's typically used by AI logic to make
    decisions about when to use abilities or when to wait for cooldowns to expire.
    This method is part of the broader PvP combat system that helps determine optimal
    behavior for AI-controlled hunters in player-versus-player encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a Player object representing the hunter whose offensive
      cooldowns are being checked. Must be a valid pointer to a hunter class player,
      otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of offensive cooldowns
    currently active for the specified hunter player. A return value of 0 indicates
    no offensive cooldowns are active, while higher values indicate the count of active
    cooldowns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check hunter cooldowns
    code: "Player* hunter = ...; // Get hunter player\nint cooldownCount = pvpCombatAI->GetHunterOffensiveCooldowns(hunter);\n\
      if (cooldownCount == 0) {\n    // All offensive abilities are available\n  \
      \  // Use an ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cooldown information for AI decision making
    code: "Player* hunter = ...;\nint cooldowns = pvpCombatAI->GetHunterOffensiveCooldowns(hunter);\n\
      if (cooldowns < 3) {\n    // Hunter has fewer than 3 offensive cooldowns\n \
      \   // Consider using a high-impact ability\n    if (hunter->HasSpellCooldown(SpellId::ExplosiveShot))\
      \ {\n        // Use a different ability\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the AI system to make strategic
    decisions about when to use abilities. The implementation may cache or precompute
    cooldown information for performance reasons. It's important to note that this
    method only considers 'offensive' cooldowns, which typically excludes defensive
    abilities and utility spells.
  warnings: The player parameter must be a valid pointer to a hunter class player
    object. Passing an invalid or non-hunter player pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method should not be called on non-player entities or
    players of other classes.
