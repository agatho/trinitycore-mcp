  method: Initialize
  signature: void SpatialHostileCache::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the spatial hostile cache for tracking nearby hostile units.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal data structures and state
    required for the SpatialHostileCache to function properly. This includes allocating
    memory, setting initial values for tracking parameters, and preparing the cache
    for subsequent operations such as adding or removing hostile units. The method
    should be called once during object construction or initialization phase before
    any other spatial hostile cache operations are performed. It ensures that the
    cache is in a valid state and ready to provide accurate spatial queries about
    nearby hostile targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache;

      cache.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    creature or player initialization. Developers should not need to call this manually
    unless implementing custom spatial caching logic. The initialization process may
    involve setting up internal containers and establishing default tracking thresholds.
