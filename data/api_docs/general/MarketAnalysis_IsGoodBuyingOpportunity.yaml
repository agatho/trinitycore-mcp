  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: IsGoodBuyingOpportunity
  signature: bool MarketAnalysis::IsGoodBuyingOpportunity(uint32 itemId, uint32 price)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether purchasing a specific item at the given price represents
    a good buying opportunity based on market analysis.
  description: The IsGoodBuyingOpportunity method evaluates whether an item's current
    market price is favorable for purchase by comparing it against historical data,
    demand trends, and other relevant factors. This method is typically used in automated
    trading systems or player assistance tools within the TrinityCore framework to
    help players make informed decisions about when to buy items from the auction
    house. The evaluation considers various economic indicators such as average price
    fluctuations, supply-demand ratios, and recent transaction history for the specified
    item. It returns true if the conditions indicate a favorable buying opportunity,
    and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to evaluate. Must correspond to
      a valid item in the game database.
  - name: price
    description: The current price offered for the item. This value should be expressed
      in copper coins (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold).
  returns: Returns true if the specified item at the given price presents a good buying
    opportunity according to internal market analysis logic; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (marketAnalysis->IsGoodBuyingOpportunity(18732, 50000)) {\n    // Item\
      \ is a good buy\n    printf(\"Item ID %u is a good buying opportunity at %u\
      \ copper\\n\", 18732, 50000);\n} else {\n    // Item is not a good buy\n   \
      \ printf(\"Item ID %u is not a good buying opportunity at %u copper\\n\", 18732,\
      \ 50000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with auction house logic
    code: "uint32 itemId = 18732;\nuint32 currentPrice = 50000;\nif (marketAnalysis->IsGoodBuyingOpportunity(itemId,\
      \ currentPrice)) {\n    // Proceed to place bid\n    AuctionHouseMgr::PlaceBid(itemId,\
      \ currentPrice);\n} else {\n    // Skip bidding\n    LOG_INFO(\"custom\", \"\
      Skipping bid on item %u due to poor market conditions.\", itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on cached or real-time data from the auction house
    and may require sufficient market history to provide accurate results. The implementation
    might be computationally intensive if it involves complex statistical analysis
    of large datasets.
  warnings: Ensure that the item ID and price values are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid inputs could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect evaluations.
    This method should not be used in performance-critical sections without considering
    its potential computational overhead.
