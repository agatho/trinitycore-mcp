documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the ground mount information for a player
  description: The GetGroundMount method returns a pointer to the MountInfo structure
    that represents the player's current ground mount. This method is typically used
    in the context of World of Warcraft's mount system to determine which ground-based
    mount a player is currently using. The returned MountInfo pointer can be used
    to access various properties of the mount such as its display ID, spell ID, and
    other mount-related attributes. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a MountInfo structure representing the player's ground
    mount, or nullptr if the player is not riding a ground mount
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const MountInfo* groundMount = mountManager->GetGroundMount();\nif (groundMount\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Player is riding: \" << groundMount->displayId\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Player is not riding a ground\
      \ mount\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the MountManager instance has been properly initialized
    with player data. The returned MountInfo pointer is only valid while the MountManager
    instance remains alive and the player's mount state hasn't changed.
  warnings: The returned pointer should not be modified or freed by the caller. Ensure
    that the MountManager object is still valid when accessing the returned MountInfo
    structure to avoid dangling pointer issues.
