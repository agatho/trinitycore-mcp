  class: CombatReference
  method: Suppress
  signature: void CombatReference::Suppress(Unit * who)
documentation:
  brief: Suppresses combat engagement for the specified unit, preventing further combat
    actions.
  description: The CombatReference::Suppress method is used to disable or suppress
    combat behavior for a given Unit object. This function typically prevents the
    unit from engaging in combat, attacking other units, or being involved in combat-related
    events. It's commonly used during combat transitions, temporary pacification,
    or when a unit needs to be removed from active combat state without fully removing
    it from the battlefield. The suppression is usually temporary and can be lifted
    by calling related methods such as CombatReference::Unsuppress.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose combat engagement should be suppressed.
      Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Suppressing a Player's Combat State
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    combatRef->Suppress(target);\n\
      \    // Target is now suppressed from combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Suppressing Multiple Units in a Group
    code: "for (auto& member : group->GetMembers())\n{\n    if (member->IsAlive()\
      \ && member->IsInCombat())\n    {\n        combatRef->Suppress(member);\n  \
      \  }\n}\n// All group members are now suppressed from combat"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal combat state flags or references within
    the CombatReference object. It may also trigger combat state change events internally.
    The suppression is typically not permanent and can be reversed by calling related
    methods.
  warnings: Ensure that 'who' parameter is a valid Unit pointer to avoid undefined
    behavior. Improper use of this method in combat scenarios could lead to inconsistent
    combat states or game logic errors.
