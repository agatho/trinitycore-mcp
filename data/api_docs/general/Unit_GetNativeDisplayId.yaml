  class: Unit
  method: GetNativeDisplayId
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetNativeDisplayId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the native display ID of the unit, which represents the unique visual
    appearance identifier used by the game engine.
  description: The GetNativeDisplayId method retrieves the native display ID of a
    Unit object, which is a unique identifier that defines how the unit appears in
    the game world. This value is crucial for determining the visual representation
    of creatures or players and is used internally by TrinityCore to manage display
    information. The method does not require any parameters and returns a uint32 value
    representing the display ID. This ID is typically set during object creation and
    may change based on transformations like morphing or temporary appearance changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the native display ID of the unit,
    which corresponds to the visual appearance identifier used by the game engine.
    This value can be used to determine the specific model or sprite displayed for
    the unit in-game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 displayId = unit->GetNativeDisplayId();

      // Use displayId to retrieve visual information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core Unit class and should be used carefully as
    it may affect visual rendering. Performance considerations are minimal since this
    is a simple getter method, but it's important to note that display IDs can change
    during gameplay due to transformations or temporary appearance modifications.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining actual visual appearance
    unless you're working with the core game engine logic. Be cautious when using
    this value in conjunction with other methods that might modify display information,
    as it could lead to inconsistencies if not handled properly.
