  class: MovementGenerator
  method: Resume
  signature: void MovementGenerator::Resume(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Resumes a paused movement generator, continuing its movement behavior.
  description: The Resume method is used to continue the execution of a previously
    paused movement generator. This method typically restores the movement state of
    an object (such as a creature or player) that was temporarily halted, allowing
    it to resume its intended path or behavior. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with Pause methods within the TrinityCore movement system to control dynamic movement
    behaviors during gameplay events such as combat, spell casting, or environmental
    interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A uint32 parameter that may represent a specific movement state identifier
      or context flag. The exact meaning depends on the implementing subclass of MovementGenerator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (m_isPaused)\n        {\n            m_movementGenerator->Resume(0);\n\
      \            m_isPaused = false;\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    bool m_isPaused\
      \ = false;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on movement generators that are in a paused
    state. Calling Resume on an already active generator may result in undefined behavior
    or unexpected movement patterns.
