  class: WarriorAI
  method: DetermineOptimalStance
  signature: WarriorStance WarriorAI::DetermineOptimalStance(::Unit * target, const
    int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal warrior stance based on target and enemy count for
    maximum damage output.
  description: The DetermineOptimalStance method evaluates the current combat situation
    to select the most effective warrior stance. It considers factors such as the
    number of enemies present and the target's characteristics to decide between Battle
    Stance, Defensive Stance, or Berserker Stance. This method is typically called
    during AI decision-making processes to optimize combat performance. The method
    does not directly modify the warrior's stance but returns a WarriorStance enum
    value that can be used by calling code to apply the appropriate stance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a WarriorStance enum value indicating the optimal stance for current
    combat conditions. Possible values include WARRIOR_STANCE_BATTLE, WARRIOR_STANCE_DEFENSIVE,
    and WARRIOR_STANCE_BERSERKER.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "WarriorStance optimalStance = ai->DetermineOptimalStance(target, enemyCount);\n\
      switch (optimalStance)\n{\n    case WARRIOR_STANCE_BATTLE:\n        // Apply\
      \ battle stance\n        break;\n    case WARRIOR_STANCE_DEFENSIVE:\n      \
      \  // Apply defensive stance\n        break;\n    case WARRIOR_STANCE_BERSERKER:\n\
      \        // Apply berserker stance\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI class and relies on internal combat
    state tracking. It should be called frequently during combat to ensure optimal
    stance selection as conditions change. The implementation may consider factors
    such as target health, distance, and threat level when determining the best stance.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters (target and enemies) and will
    not handle null pointers gracefully. Calling this method outside of combat context
    may produce unexpected results. Ensure that the warrior unit is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
