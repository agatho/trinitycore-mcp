  class: EmpoweredSpell
  method: EmpoweredSpell
  signature: void EmpoweredSpell::EmpoweredSpell(int spell, EmpowermentLevel level,
    int * tgt)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an empowered spell with specified spell ID, empowerment level,
    and target.
  description: The EmpoweredSpell constructor initializes a new empowered spell instance
    with the provided spell identifier, empowerment level, and target parameter. This
    method sets up the necessary internal state for handling empowered spells within
    the TrinityCore framework. The spell ID corresponds to a specific spell in the
    game database, while the empowerment level determines the strength or effect modification
    of the spell. The target parameter points to an integer that will be updated with
    the result of the empowerment calculation.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the spell to be empowered. This must
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  - name: level
    description: The empowerment level that determines how much the spell should be
      enhanced. Valid values are typically defined by the EmpowermentLevel enumeration.
  - name: tgt
    description: Pointer to an integer that will store the calculated empowered spell
      effect or result. This value is updated during the empowerment process.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Empowered Spell Initialization
    code: 'int targetValue = 0;

      EmpowermentLevel level = EmpowermentLevel::MODERATE;

      EmpoweredSpell empoweredSpell(12345, level, &targetValue);

      // targetValue now contains the empowered spell result'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Different Empowerment Levels
    code: 'int result1 = 0;

      int result2 = 0;

      EmpoweredSpell empowered1(67890, EmpowermentLevel::STRONG, &result1);

      EmpoweredSpell empowered2(67890, EmpowermentLevel::WEAK, &result2);

      // Both spells use the same spell ID but different empowerment levels'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell processing systems where spells can
    be enhanced based on player attributes or environmental conditions. The target
    parameter should be initialized before calling this constructor to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID provided corresponds to an actual spell in the
    database; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Also, make sure the target pointer
    is valid and points to a writable integer variable.
