  signature: int AreaTriggerActionSetEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with an area trigger action set entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitwise
    flags that define the behavior and properties of a specific area trigger action
    set entry. These flags are typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to
    control how area triggers function, such as whether they should be activated on
    player enter, leave, or other events. The returned value can be combined with
    bitmask operations to check for specific flag states. This method is commonly
    used during area trigger processing and event handling within the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitwise flags of the area trigger action set
    entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior
    of the area trigger, such as activation conditions, visual effects, or interaction
    types.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an area trigger is enabled
    code: "AreaTriggerActionSetEntry* entry = sAreaTriggerActionSetStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry && (entry->GetFlags() & 0x01)) {\n    // Area trigger is enabled\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combine flags to determine trigger behavior
    code: "AreaTriggerActionSetEntry* entry = sAreaTriggerActionSetStore.LookupEntry(54321);\n\
      int flags = entry->GetFlags();\nif (flags & 0x02) {\n    // Trigger activates\
      \ on player enter\n} else if (flags & 0x04) {\n    // Trigger activates on player\
      \ leave\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in the game's database
    or configuration files. Developers should consult the TrinityCore documentation
    or source code to understand the meaning of each bit in the returned integer value.
    This method is thread-safe as it only reads from a constant data structure.
  warnings: Be cautious when performing bitwise operations on the return value without
    proper validation, as incorrect flag handling may lead to unexpected area trigger
    behavior. The method assumes that the entry has been properly loaded and validated.
