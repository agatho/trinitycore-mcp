  brief: Removes a player from the battleground's free slot queue.
  description: The RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue method removes a player from the free
    slot queue in a battleground, typically used when a player is assigned to a specific
    team or when they are no longer eligible for free slot assignment. This method
    is part of the battleground management system and ensures proper queue handling
    during matchmaking and player assignment processes. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no direct return operations, focusing solely on queue
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Join Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerJoin(Battleground* bg, Player* player)\n{\n    // ...\
      \ other logic ...\n    if (bg->IsFreeForAll() && !bg->HasFreeSlots())\n    {\n\
      \        bg->RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue();\n        // Assign player to a team\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battleground system during
    player assignment and queue management. It's important to understand that calling
    this method outside of proper context may lead to inconsistent queue states or
    unexpected behavior in battleground matchmaking.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromBGFreeSlotQueue without verifying that a player is actually
    in the free slot queue may result in undefined behavior. This method should only
    be invoked when the player has been successfully added to the free slot queue
    previously.
