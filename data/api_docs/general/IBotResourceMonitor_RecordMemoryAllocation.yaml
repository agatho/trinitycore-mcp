  class: IBotResourceMonitor
  method: RecordMemoryAllocation
  signature: void IBotResourceMonitor::RecordMemoryAllocation(size_t bytes)
documentation:
  brief: Records a memory allocation event with the specified byte count for resource
    monitoring purposes.
  description: The RecordMemoryAllocation method is used to track memory allocations
    within the bot system for performance monitoring and resource management. This
    method logs the size of allocated memory blocks to help identify memory usage
    patterns, detect potential leaks, or optimize memory consumption in AI-driven
    bot behavior. The method does not perform any actual allocation itself but serves
    as a reporting mechanism for memory operations that have already occurred. It
    is typically called by internal bot subsystems when they allocate memory for data
    structures, pathfinding grids, or other runtime resources needed for bot functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: bytes
    description: The number of bytes that were allocated in the memory operation.
      Must be a positive integer value representing the size of the allocation in
      bytes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Allocation Recording
    code: "void SomeBotComponent::Initialize()\n{\n    // Allocate some memory for\
      \ bot pathfinding\n    uint8* pathBuffer = new uint8[1024];\n    \n    // Record\
      \ the allocation for monitoring purposes\n    sBotAI->GetResourceMonitor()->RecordMemoryAllocation(1024);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Multiple Allocations
    code: "void BotBehavior::Update()\n{\n    // Simulate multiple allocations during\
      \ bot update cycle\n    uint32* aiData = new uint32[100];\n    sBotAI->GetResourceMonitor()->RecordMemoryAllocation(100\
      \ * sizeof(uint32));\n    \n    float* pathPoints = new float[50];\n    sBotAI->GetResourceMonitor()->RecordMemoryAllocation(50\
      \ * sizeof(float));\n    \n    // Clean up\n    delete[] aiData;\n    delete[]\
      \ pathPoints;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the resource monitoring infrastructure and should
    be called whenever memory is allocated by bot components. The implementation likely
    maintains internal statistics about total allocated bytes, peak usage, and allocation
    frequency. It's important to note that this method only records allocations; it
    does not track deallocations, so paired calls with RecordMemoryDeallocation would
    be needed for complete tracking.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper memory management can lead to inaccurate
    resource monitoring data. Ensure all allocations are properly tracked by calling
    both RecordMemoryAllocation and RecordMemoryDeallocation for each allocation/deallocation
    pair. This method should not be called for internal system allocations that are
    already being monitored by the core engine.
