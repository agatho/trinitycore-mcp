documentation:
  brief: Removes the GameObject from the world, making it invisible and uninteractable
    to players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method removes a GameObject from the active world
    state, effectively taking it out of play. This action prevents players from interacting
    with the object and removes it from the game's object manager. The method is typically
    used when a GameObject needs to be destroyed or temporarily hidden, such as during
    quest completion or when the object is no longer needed. It ensures that the GameObject
    is properly removed from all relevant systems including the grid system and player
    interaction lists.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      // ... initialize GameObject ...



      // Remove the GameObject from world

      go->RemoveFromWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it directly affects the object's
    visibility and interaction state. It is recommended to call this method before
    destruction or when the GameObject needs to be temporarily removed from gameplay.
    The method does not immediately delete the GameObject but rather removes it from
    active world management.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromWorld without proper cleanup can lead to memory leaks
    or dangling references if not handled correctly. This method should never be called
    on objects that are already removed from world, as it may cause undefined behavior.
