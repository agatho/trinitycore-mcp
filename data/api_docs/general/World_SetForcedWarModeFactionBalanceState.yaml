  class: World
  method: SetForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState
  signature: void World::SetForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState(int team, int32 reward)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the forced war mode faction balance state for a specified team with
    a given reward value.
  description: The SetForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState method configures the war mode
    faction balance settings for a specific team within the game world. This method
    is typically used to enforce or modify the war mode behavior for factions, particularly
    in battlegrounds or arena environments where team-based combat dynamics are critical.
    The 'team' parameter specifies which faction team (Alliance or Horde) this setting
    applies to, while the 'reward' parameter defines the associated reward value that
    influences faction balance mechanics. This method likely affects how faction standing,
    rewards, and combat balance are calculated during war mode events.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: An integer identifier specifying the team for which to set the war
      mode faction balance state. Typically represents Alliance (0) or Horde (1).
  - name: reward
    description: A signed 32-bit integer representing the reward value associated
      with the faction balance state. This value influences how faction rewards and
      balance are calculated during war mode.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Horde War Mode Faction Balance
    code: World::Instance()->SetForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState(1, 500);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Alliance War Mode Rewards
    code: World::Instance()->SetForcedWarModeFactionBalanceState(0, -250);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal war mode system and may only be
    called during specific game events or transitions. It's important to understand
    that modifying these values can affect player rewards and faction standings in
    battlegrounds.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method may lead to unexpected behavior in faction
    balance calculations or reward distribution. Ensure that the team parameter is
    valid (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) and that the reward value aligns with expected
    game mechanics.
