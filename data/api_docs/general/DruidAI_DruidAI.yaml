  class: DruidAI
  method: DruidAI
  signature: void DruidAI::DruidAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the DruidAI class with a pointer to a bot integer, setting up
    the AI behavior for a druid character in the game.
  description: The DruidAI constructor initializes the AI system for a druid class
    bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up internal state and configuration
    variables necessary for the druid AI to function properly. The method takes a
    pointer to an integer representing the bot instance, which is used to associate
    the AI with a specific druid character in the game world. It likely configures
    spell casting priorities, movement patterns, and combat behaviors specific to
    druid abilities such as shapeshifting, healing, and damage dealing. This initialization
    is crucial for ensuring that the druid bot behaves appropriately within the game's
    AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the druid bot instance identifier.
      This parameter links the AI to a specific character in the game world and is
      used internally by the AI system to manage the bot's state, actions, and behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic DruidAI Initialization
    code: 'int druidBotId = 12345;

      DruidAI* druidAI = new DruidAI(&druidBotId);

      // The AI is now initialized and ready to control the druid bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the initialization phase of a druid
    bot. The pointer passed must point to a valid integer that represents an active
    bot instance in the TrinityCore system. The AI system may perform memory allocations
    and setup operations during this constructor call.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid bot identifier could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the AI system. Ensure that the bot parameter points
    to a properly initialized and valid integer before calling this constructor.
