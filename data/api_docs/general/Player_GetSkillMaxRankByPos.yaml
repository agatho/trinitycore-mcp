documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum rank of a skill at the specified position in the player's
    skill list.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum rank that a skill can achieve at
    a given position within the player's skill list. It is commonly used to determine
    the highest possible skill level for a specific skill, which may be influenced
    by factors such as character level, class-specific skill limits, or other game
    mechanics. The method operates on the player's internal skill data structure and
    returns a uint16 value representing the maximum rank. This function is typically
    used in conjunction with other skill-related methods to manage skill progression
    and player capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the maximum rank of the skill at the specified position, represented
    as a uint16 value. The value indicates the highest possible skill level for that
    skill, which could be zero if the skill is not available or has not been learned
    yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint16 maxRank = player->GetSkillMaxRankByPos(0);

      // Returns the maximum rank for the first skill in the skill list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal skill management system and should be
    used carefully when dealing with skill progression. It does not perform any validation
    checks on the input position, so invalid positions may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory access violations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying the position; invalid
    positions can cause crashes or unexpected results. Also note that this method
    only returns the maximum rank, not the current skill level.
