documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of a guild rank corresponding to the specified rank ID
  description: The _GetRankName method is a private helper function within the Guild
    class that retrieves the localized name of a specific guild rank. It takes a GuildRankId
    parameter which represents the unique identifier for a rank within the guild structure.
    This method is typically used internally by the Guild class to display or reference
    rank names in various guild-related operations such as permissions checking, rank
    assignment notifications, or UI display elements. The method performs a lookup
    in the internal rank data structure using the provided rank ID and returns the
    corresponding localized string name for that rank.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the localized name of the guild rank associated
    with the provided GuildRankId. Returns an empty string if the rank ID is invalid
    or not found in the guild's rank structure.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve rank name for a specific rank ID
    code: 'Guild* myGuild = ...; // Assume guild object exists

      GuildRankId rankId = GR_GUILDMASTER;

      std::string rankName = myGuild->_GetRankName(rankId);

      // rankName will contain the localized name of the Guild Master rank'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a private method, so it should only be called from within the Guild
    class or its friends. The method relies on internal guild rank data structures
    being properly initialized. It's likely used in conjunction with other guild management
    functions to provide complete rank information for display or validation purposes.
  warnings: Since this is a private method, calling it directly from outside the Guild
    class may lead to undefined behavior or compilation errors. Ensure that any usage
    respects the intended encapsulation of the Guild class. The method may return
    an empty string if passed an invalid rank ID, so callers should verify the result
    before using it.
