documentation:
  brief: Updates the resource state of the AI-controlled thread-safe class instance.
  description: The UpdateResourceState method is responsible for synchronizing and
    refreshing the current resource status within a thread-safe AI class. This method
    ensures that all resource-related data, such as health, mana, energy, or other
    game-specific attributes, are accurately reflected in the AI's internal state.
    It typically handles synchronization between different threads to prevent race
    conditions and maintains consistency of resource values during AI decision-making
    processes. The method is commonly invoked during AI update cycles to ensure that
    the AI has access to the most up-to-date resource information for behavior calculations.

    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_ai->UpdateResourceState();\n\
      \    // ... continue with decision making ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe, meaning it can be called from
    multiple threads without causing data corruption. It likely uses internal locking
    mechanisms or atomic operations to ensure resource consistency. The method may
    also trigger events or callbacks when resource states change, depending on the
    implementation.
