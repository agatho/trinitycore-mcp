  signature: uint32 SpellMgr::GetPrevSpellInChain(uint32 spell_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the previous spell in the spell chain for a given spell ID.
  description: The GetPrevSpellInChain method returns the spell ID of the preceding
    spell in a spell chain, which is used in World of Warcraft to manage spell upgrades
    and transformations. This functionality is essential for handling abilities that
    evolve or transform into more powerful versions as players level up or gain new
    talents. The method looks up the provided spell ID in the internal spell chain
    database and returns the identifier of the previous spell in the sequence. If
    the specified spell has no previous spell in its chain, it will return 0. This
    method is commonly used during spell processing to determine if a spell can be
    upgraded or transformed based on the player's current spell knowledge.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the spell ID of the previous spell in the chain. If the input spell_id
    has no previous spell in its chain, returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spell chain progression
    code: "uint32 prevSpellId = sSpellMgr->GetPrevSpellInChain(12345);\nif (prevSpellId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // This spell has a previous version in the chain\n    printf(\"\
      Previous spell ID: %u\\n\", prevSpellId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // This is likely\
      \ the base spell in the chain\n    printf(\"No previous spell found in chain.\\\
      n\");\n}"

  notes: This method relies on internal spell chain data that is typically populated
    from SQL spell chain tables during server startup. The spell chain information
    is used by the game engine to manage spell upgrades, talent trees, and ability
    transformations. It's important to note that this method only works with valid
    spell IDs that exist in the database.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying that the input spell_id
    exists in the database, as invalid spell IDs may cause unexpected behavior or
    return incorrect values. Also, be aware that some spells might not have a defined
    chain, so always check for a return value of 0 before assuming the spell is part
    of a chain.
