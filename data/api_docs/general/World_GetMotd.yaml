documentation:
  brief: Returns the message of the day (MOTD) identifier for the world.
  description: The GetMotd method retrieves the unique identifier associated with
    the current world's message of the day. This identifier is typically used to fetch
    or display specific MOTD content from the database or configuration files. The
    returned value represents a reference to an internal MOTD storage mechanism within
    the World class, allowing systems to determine which message should be shown to
    players upon login or connection. This method does not perform any database queries
    directly but rather returns a cached or pre-loaded identifier that corresponds
    to the active MOTD.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the unique identifier of
    the current world's message of the day. This ID can be used to look up the actual
    MOTD text in the database or configuration system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display MOTD Identifier
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      int motdId = world->GetMotd();

      std::cout << "Current MOTD ID: " << motdId << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal integer member variable, so
    modifying the returned value will not affect the actual MOTD identifier stored
    in the World object. The MOTD ID is typically initialized during server startup
    or configuration loading and remains constant throughout the server's runtime
    unless explicitly changed by administrative commands or code.
