  method: JustUnregisteredDynObject
  signature: void CreatureAI::JustUnregisteredDynObject(DynamicObject * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a dynamic object associated with this creature is unregistered
    from the world.
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when a DynamicObject
    that was previously registered with this CreatureAI instance is removed from the
    game world. It typically occurs when the dynamic object expires, is destroyed,
    or is explicitly removed. The method allows the AI to perform cleanup operations
    or state updates related to the dynamic object's removal. This callback is part
    of the AI lifecycle management for dynamic objects and helps maintain synchronization
    between the creature's AI state and the actual game objects in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustUnregisteredDynObject(DynamicObject*\
      \ dynObj) override {\n        // Perform cleanup when dynamic object is removed\n\
      \        if (dynObj && dynObj->GetCaster() == me)\n            DoSomethingWhenDynamicObjectRemoved();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the dynamic object's removal process, so any
    access to the DynamicObject pointer should be safe as long as it has not been
    freed. The AI implementation should avoid performing heavy operations in this
    callback to prevent performance degradation.
  warnings: Do not assume that the DynamicObject pointer will remain valid beyond
    the scope of this method call. Avoid modifying or deleting the object directly
    within this method unless you are certain about the lifecycle management.
