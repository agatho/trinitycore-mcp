  method: Initialize
  signature: void StatementClassifier::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the StatementClassifier by setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for statement classification operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the StatementClassifier object for use
    by constructing necessary internal data structures, loading required configuration
    data, and ensuring all prerequisite components are ready. This method is typically
    called during system startup or when the classifier needs to be reset before processing
    new sets of statements. It performs setup tasks such as initializing lookup tables,
    compiling regular expressions, or loading classification rules from database or
    configuration files. The method ensures thread safety by using appropriate synchronization
    mechanisms if multiple threads may access the classifier concurrently.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'StatementClassifier classifier;

      classifier.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per StatementClassifier instance.
    Subsequent calls may result in undefined behavior or data corruption. The initialization
    process is blocking and may take several milliseconds depending on the complexity
    of the classifier rules.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same instance without proper
    cleanup can lead to memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that any
    existing classification operations are completed before calling this method.
