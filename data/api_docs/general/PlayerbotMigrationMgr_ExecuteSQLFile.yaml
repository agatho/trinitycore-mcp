  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: ExecuteSQLFile
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ExecuteSQLFile(const std::string & filepath)
documentation:
  brief: Executes SQL commands from a specified file within the Playerbot migration
    manager context.
  description: The ExecuteSQLFile method reads and executes SQL statements contained
    in a given file path. It is typically used during database migration or initialization
    processes for player bot functionality within TrinityCore. The method ensures
    that all SQL commands are executed in sequence, handling potential errors gracefully
    by returning a boolean status indicating success or failure of the entire operation.
    This function plays a critical role in setting up or updating player bot-related
    database schemas and data.
  parameters:
  - name: filepath
    description: The absolute or relative path to the SQL file containing the commands
      to be executed. The file must be accessible by the server process and contain
      valid SQL syntax compatible with the TrinityCore database system.
  returns: Returns true if all SQL commands in the file were successfully executed;
    otherwise, returns false if any command fails or if the file cannot be read.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteSQLFile
    code: "PlayerbotMigrationMgr migrationMgr;\nbool success = migrationMgr.ExecuteSQLFile(\"\
      ./data/migrations/playerbot_schema_update.sql\");\nif (success) {\n    // Migration\
      \ completed successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle migration failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the database connection is already established and
    valid. It does not manage transaction boundaries, so individual SQL statements
    should be designed to handle rollback scenarios if needed. The file path must
    point to a location accessible by the server process with appropriate read permissions.
  warnings: Using this method with malformed or malicious SQL files can lead to database
    corruption or security vulnerabilities. Always validate and sanitize input file
    paths and contents before calling this method. Avoid executing large SQL files
    in synchronous contexts as it may block other operations.
