  class: BotProfiler
  method: SetProfilingMode
  signature: void BotProfiler::SetProfilingMode(const std::string & mode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the profiling mode for bot behavior analysis.
  description: Configures the profiling mode that determines how bot behavior is recorded
    and analyzed within the TrinityCore framework. This method allows administrators
    or developers to switch between different profiling modes such as performance
    monitoring, behavior logging, or detailed statistics collection. The profiling
    mode affects how bot actions are tracked and reported during gameplay, enabling
    debugging and optimization of AI behaviors. The change takes effect immediately
    for newly created bots and may influence existing bot sessions depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters:
  - name: mode
    description: A string identifier specifying the desired profiling mode. Valid
      values include 'none', 'performance', 'behavior', and 'detailed'. The exact
      modes supported depend on the current implementation of the BotProfiler system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Performance Profiling Mode
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetProfilingMode("performance");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set Detailed Behavior Logging
    code: 'BotProfiler* profiler = sBotProfiler;

      profiler->SetProfilingMode("detailed");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies global profiling settings that may affect all bots in
    the system. It is recommended to call this before initializing any bots to ensure
    consistent behavior tracking. The implementation may require a restart of bot
    processes to fully apply changes in some configurations.
  warnings: Changing the profiling mode while active bots are running might lead to
    inconsistent data collection or unexpected behavior. Always verify that no bots
    are actively using the profiler before changing modes.
