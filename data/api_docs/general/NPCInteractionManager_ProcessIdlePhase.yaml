  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::ProcessIdlePhase()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the idle phase for NPC interactions, managing state transitions
    and updating interaction timers.
  description: The ProcessIdlePhase method handles the core logic for managing an
    NPC's idle state within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically invoked during
    periodic updates to evaluate whether the NPC should transition to another interaction
    phase, such as initiating dialogue or returning to a default idle animation. This
    method ensures that NPCs maintain appropriate behavior and timing during inactive
    periods, including updating internal timers and checking for conditions that may
    trigger state changes. The method operates within the context of the NPC's interaction
    manager and is part of the broader AI system responsible for dynamic NPC behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (m_npcInteractionManager)\n\
      \        m_npcInteractionManager->ProcessIdlePhase();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from within an NPC's AI update loop. It does
    not directly modify the NPC's visual or behavioral state but rather evaluates
    conditions that may lead to such changes in subsequent calls.
