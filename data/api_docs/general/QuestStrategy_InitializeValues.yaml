  brief: Initializes quest-related AI values and strategies for the player
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up internal data structures and configuration
    parameters required for quest-based AI behavior. This method is typically called
    during quest initialization or when a player's quest state changes, ensuring that
    all relevant quest strategies are properly configured. It prepares the AI system
    to handle quest-related decisions such as quest acceptance, objective tracking,
    and reward collection. The method does not require any external inputs and performs
    internal setup operations to synchronize quest data with the AI decision-making
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'QuestStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeValues();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called after quest data has been loaded or
    modified, but before any quest-related AI decisions are made. It performs no locking
    operations and assumes thread safety is handled by the calling code.
