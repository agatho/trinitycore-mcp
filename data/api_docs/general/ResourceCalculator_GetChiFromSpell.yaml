  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: GetChiFromSpell
  signature: uint32 ResourceCalculator::GetChiFromSpell(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the amount of Chi generated by a specified spell in
    the game.
  description: The GetChiFromSpell method retrieves the Chi resource value associated
    with a given spell ID. This method is primarily used in martial arts and elemental-based
    class mechanics within World of Warcraft, particularly for classes such as Monks
    who utilize Chi as a primary resource. The method performs a lookup in internal
    spell data tables to determine how much Chi should be generated or consumed when
    the specified spell is cast. It ensures that only valid spell IDs are processed,
    returning zero for invalid or non-Chi-generating spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the amount of Chi generated by the
    specified spell. If the spell ID is invalid or does not generate Chi, the method
    returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 chi = resourceCalculator.GetChiFromSpell(12345); // Returns Chi amount
      for spell ID 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Chi Generation
    code: "uint32 chi = resourceCalculator.GetChiFromSpell(67890);\nif (chi > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Spell generates Chi\n    printf(\"This spell generates %u Chi\\n\"\
      , chi);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Spell does not generate Chi\n    printf(\"This spell\
      \ does not generate Chi\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal spell data tables and assumes that the spell
    ID provided corresponds to a valid spell in the game's database. It is recommended
    to validate spell IDs before calling this method for optimal performance. This
    method does not modify any state or interact with player objects directly; it
    only returns calculated values based on static spell definitions.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spell ID may result in a return value
    of zero, which could be misinterpreted as 'no Chi generated' when the actual issue
    is an invalid input. Always verify that the spell ID exists in the game's spell
    database before invoking this function.
