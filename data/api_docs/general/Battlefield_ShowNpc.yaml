  class: Battlefield
  method: ShowNpc
  signature: void Battlefield::ShowNpc(Creature * creature, bool aggressive)
documentation:
  brief: Displays a creature NPC in the battlefield context with optional aggressive
    behavior.
  description: The ShowNpc method is used to make a Creature object visible and active
    within the Battlefield framework. This method controls how NPCs are presented
    to players during battlefield events, such as those in Wintergrasp or other contested
    zones. The 'aggressive' parameter determines whether the NPC should be displayed
    with hostile intentions or neutral behavior. When called, this method typically
    updates the creature's visibility state, faction, and possibly its AI behavior
    to align with the current battlefield context.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that should be shown in the battlefield.
      Must not be null.
  - name: aggressive
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the NPC should be displayed with
      aggressive behavior (true) or neutral/peaceful behavior (false).
  returns: No return value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Creature* npc = player->SummonCreature(12345, x, y, z, o);\nBattlefield*\
      \ bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldForZone(1234);\nif (bf)\n    bf->ShowNpc(npc,\
      \ true);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Aggressive Display
    code: "if (player->GetTeamId() == TEAM_ALLIANCE)\n{\n    Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldForZone(530);\n\
      \    if (bf)\n        bf->ShowNpc(npc, false);\n}\nelse\n{\n    bf->ShowNpc(npc,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during battlefield initialization or when
    adding NPCs to a battlefield zone. It's important to ensure that the Creature
    pointer is valid and that the Battlefield instance exists before calling this
    method. The aggressive flag may affect how the NPC interacts with players, including
    AI behavior and faction settings.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null creature pointer will likely result in
    a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the battlefield context is properly
    initialized before invoking this method. Misusing the aggressive flag can lead
    to unexpected player interactions or quest failures.
