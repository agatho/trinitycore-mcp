    bool withInstant)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the specified spell currently being cast by the unit.
  description: The InterruptSpell method stops any ongoing spell casting process for
    the specified spell type, effectively halting the spell execution. This method
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage spell
    interruption mechanics during combat or when a unit is affected by certain effects.
    The method can interrupt spells with varying delay and instant properties, allowing
    developers to control whether the spell interruption occurs immediately or after
    a delay. It is particularly useful for managing spell casting behavior when a
    unit is interrupted by external factors such as damage or movement.
  parameters:
  - name: spellType
    description: Specifies the type of spell to interrupt, typically defined by enum
      values like CURRENT_SPELL_TYPE_MElee, CURRENT_SPELL_TYPE_Spell, etc. This determines
      which spell casting process is interrupted.
  - name: withDelayed
    description: When true, allows delayed spell interruption, meaning the spell may
      be interrupted after a delay or cooldown period. When false, the spell interruption
      occurs immediately without delay.
  - name: withInstant
    description: When true, forces immediate interruption of the spell, bypassing
      any potential delay or cooldown. When false, the spell interruption may proceed
      with normal delay behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Interruption Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_SPELL_TYPE_SPELL, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Interruption with Delayed Execution
    code: 'Unit* unit = GetUnit();

      unit->InterruptSpell(CURRENT_SPELL_TYPE_MElee, false, true);

      // This will interrupt the melee attack immediately

      // but allows other spells to be interrupted with delay'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with spell casting management
    and requires careful handling of spell types. It may be called from multiple threads
    during combat or event processing, so thread safety should be considered when
    implementing this method.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in spell casting,
    especially if the spell type is not correctly specified. Care must be taken to
    ensure that the spell interruption does not interfere with other spell mechanics
    or cause unintended side effects during combat.
