  brief: Writes collected bot metrics to a specified file.
  description: The WriteMetricsToFile method serializes and outputs all collected
    bot performance and operational metrics to a designated file on disk. This functionality
    is typically used for debugging, monitoring, or analysis purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method does not return any value but will attempt to create or
    overwrite the specified file with the current metric data. It is expected that
    the metrics collector has been properly initialized and populated with data prior
    to calling this method.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'IBotMetricsCollector* metricsCollector = GetMetricsCollector();

      metricsCollector->WriteMetricsToFile("bot_metrics.txt");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may block the calling thread while performing file I/O operations.
    Ensure that the file path provided is valid and writable by the server process.
    The output format of the metrics is implementation-defined but typically includes
    timestamps, bot identifiers, performance statistics, and other relevant operational
    data.
