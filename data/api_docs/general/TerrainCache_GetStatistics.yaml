  class: TerrainCache
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: Statistics TerrainCache::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical information about the terrain cache usage and performance
    metrics.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a Statistics object containing detailed
    information about the current state of the TerrainCache. This includes metrics
    such as cache hit rate, memory usage, number of loaded tiles, and other performance-related
    data. The statistics are useful for monitoring and optimizing terrain rendering
    performance in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. The method provides
    read-only access to internal cache metrics without modifying any cache state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A Statistics object containing various cache performance metrics including
    hit rate, loaded tile count, memory consumption, and other relevant statistics
    that describe the current state of the terrain cache system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Cache Performance
    code: 'TerrainCache& cache = TerrainCache::Instance();

      Statistics stats = cache.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Cache hit rate: " << stats.hitRate << "%" << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Loaded tiles: " << stats.loadedTiles << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    Statistics object is a snapshot of the cache state at the time of the call, so
    values may change immediately after retrieval. Performance metrics are updated
    periodically and may not reflect real-time conditions.
