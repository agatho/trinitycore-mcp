  signature: float AuctionBotConfig::GetConfig(AuctionBotConfigFloatValues index)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a floating-point configuration value from the AuctionBotConfig
    based on the provided enum index.
  description: The GetConfig method is used to retrieve specific floating-point configuration
    values stored within the AuctionBotConfig class. This method takes an enumeration
    value of type AuctionBotConfigFloatValues as input and returns the corresponding
    float value that represents a configurable parameter for the auction bot system.
    The method is typically used to access various auction-related settings such as
    bid percentages, price multipliers, or time intervals. It is designed to be a
    read-only accessor that does not modify any internal state. This method assumes
    that the configuration values have been properly initialized and loaded before
    being accessed.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: An enumeration value of type AuctionBotConfigFloatValues that specifies
      which configuration parameter to retrieve. Valid values correspond to specific
      auction bot settings such as bid multiplier, price adjustment factors, or time-based
      parameters.
  returns: A float value representing the requested configuration parameter. The actual
    meaning of the returned value depends on the index parameter and corresponds to
    a specific setting within the auction bot's configuration system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Bid Multiplier Setting
    code: 'float bidMultiplier = auctionBotConfig.GetConfig(AuctionBotConfigFloatValues::BID_MULTIPLIER);

      // Returns the configured bid multiplier value used by the auction bot for placing
      bids'
    language: cpp
  - title: Access Price Adjustment Factor
    code: 'float priceFactor = auctionBotConfig.GetConfig(AuctionBotConfigFloatValues::PRICE_ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR);

      // Gets the factor used to adjust item prices when listing items on the auction
      house'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only performs read operations on immutable
    configuration data. The implementation likely uses a lookup table or map internally
    to store and retrieve configuration values efficiently. Ensure that the AuctionBotConfig
    instance has been properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized enum value may result
    in undefined behavior or return incorrect values. Always verify that the AuctionBotConfig
    object is fully loaded and configured before accessing its settings.
