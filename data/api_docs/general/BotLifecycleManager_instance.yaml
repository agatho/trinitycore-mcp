documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotLifecycleManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotLifecycleManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application's
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global bot management functionality
    across different parts of the TrinityCore codebase. The returned pointer should
    be treated as a constant reference to the singleton instance and should not be
    deleted by the caller. This method is thread-safe in most implementations, though
    specific thread safety guarantees may depend on the underlying implementation
    details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotLifecycleManager instance. The method never
    returns NULL under normal circumstances as the singleton is typically initialized
    during system startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotLifecycleManager singleton
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager* manager = BotLifecycleManager::instance();

      // Use the manager to perform bot lifecycle operations

      manager->UpdateBots();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard singleton implementation. The instance() method should
    be called sparingly as it's typically used for global access points. The underlying
    BotLifecycleManager object is usually initialized during server startup and destroyed
    at shutdown.
  warnings: Avoid storing the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the application,
    as the singleton may be destroyed during shutdown. Do not attempt to delete or
    manage the memory of the returned pointer.
