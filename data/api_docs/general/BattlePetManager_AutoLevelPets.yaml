  class: BattlePetManager
  method: AutoLevelPets
  signature: void BattlePetManager::AutoLevelPets(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically levels up all battle pets for the specified player.
  description: The AutoLevelPets method iterates through all battle pets owned by
    the given player and automatically increases their level to match the maximum
    allowed level for that player's account or character. This method is typically
    used during player progression events, such as when a new level is reached or
    when a player logs in with previously unlevelled pets. The method ensures that
    all battle pets are brought up to an appropriate level based on game rules and
    player progression mechanics. It does not return any value but modifies the internal
    state of the player's battle pet collection.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's battle pets should be auto-leveled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      BattlePetManager::AutoLevelPets(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Player Object
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 12345));\nif (player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    BattlePetManager::AutoLevelPets(&playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing
    player in the game world. The actual level increase logic depends on the current
    level of each pet and the maximum allowed level for the player. This function
    should be called carefully during appropriate game events to avoid performance
    issues.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    player object, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also, calling this method
    too frequently can cause performance degradation in high-traffic scenarios.
