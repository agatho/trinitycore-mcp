documentation:
  brief: Handles completion of an instance by a group, updating instance data and
    rewarding players.
  description: The HandleInstanceCompletion method is responsible for processing the
    completion of a dungeon or raid instance by a player group. It updates the instance's
    completion status, awards experience and loot to group members, and manages any
    related cooldowns or achievements. This method typically gets invoked when the
    last member of the group exits the instance or when all objectives are completed.
    The method ensures that group members receive appropriate rewards based on their
    participation in the instance run.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    sInstanceCoordination->HandleInstanceCompletion(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and has completed an instance.
    It internally handles synchronization between multiple players in the group, ensuring
    all members receive consistent rewards. The method may trigger additional events
    or callbacks related to instance completion.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid group or before proper instance completion
    checks can lead to inconsistent game state or reward distribution. Ensure that
    the group has actually completed the instance before invoking this method.
