  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Demon Hunter's buff states and applies necessary aura modifications
    based on current combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing all active buffs
    and auras specific to the Demon Hunter class within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    This method evaluates the current state of the Demon Hunter, including their health,
    mana, and combat situation, to determine which buffs should be applied or removed.
    It ensures that the Demon Hunter maintains optimal performance by dynamically
    adjusting their buff stack based on game mechanics such as Fury generation, damage
    mitigation, and spell cooldowns. The method typically runs during each AI update
    cycle and interacts with the core TrinityCore systems to maintain proper aura
    states.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI logic\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless implementing custom behavior. The implementation
    relies on internal state tracking of the Demon Hunter's current buffs, which may
    be influenced by various factors including class-specific abilities, talents,
    and gear.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of the standard AI update cycle could lead
    to inconsistent buff states or unexpected behavior in combat. Ensure that all
    related aura management systems are properly synchronized with this method's execution.
