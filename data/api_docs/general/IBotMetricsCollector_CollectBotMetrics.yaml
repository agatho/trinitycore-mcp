  class: IBotMetricsCollector
  method: CollectBotMetrics
  signature: void IBotMetricsCollector::CollectBotMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Collects and processes bot-related performance and activity metrics for monitoring
    and analysis.
  description: The CollectBotMetrics method gathers various data points related to
    bot behavior, performance, and system resource usage within the TrinityCore environment.
    This includes tracking bot CPU utilization, memory consumption, AI decision-making
    frequency, and interaction patterns with game objects or players. The collected
    metrics are typically used for debugging, optimization, and ensuring stable bot
    operation in World of Warcraft servers. The method does not require any input
    parameters and performs its operations internally, updating internal metric storage
    structures. It is designed to be called periodically or upon specific events to
    maintain up-to-date performance statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in a Monitoring Loop
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateMetrics()\n{\n    m_metricsCollector->CollectBotMetrics();\n\
      \    // Additional logic to process or log collected metrics\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Logging System
    code: "class PerformanceMonitor\n{\npublic:\n    void LogBotActivity()\n    {\n\
      \        m_metricsCollector->CollectBotMetrics();\n        auto metrics = m_metricsCollector->GetLatestMetrics();\n\
      \        // Log metrics to database or external monitoring service\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by internal system components rather than
    directly by external code. It may involve heavy computation and should be called
    with consideration for performance impact. The collected data is usually stored
    in an internal buffer or cache that can be accessed via other methods like GetLatestMetrics().
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling may cause
    performance degradation. Ensure that the metrics collector has sufficient memory
    allocated to handle accumulated data points.
