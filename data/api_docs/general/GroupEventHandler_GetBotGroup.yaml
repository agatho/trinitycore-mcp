  class: GroupEventHandler
  method: GetBotGroup
  signature: Group * GroupEventHandler::GetBotGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bot group associated with the GroupEventHandler instance.
  description: The GetBotGroup method returns a pointer to the Group object that represents
    the bot group managed by this GroupEventHandler. This method is typically used
    in TrinityCore's AI and bot management systems to access or manipulate the group
    of bots controlled by the event handler. The returned Group pointer may be null
    if no bot group has been assigned or initialized yet. This functionality is essential
    for managing automated player characters (bots) within group scenarios, such as
    in battlegrounds or world events where scripted bot behavior is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Group object representing the bot group, or nullptr if
    no bot group has been assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* botGroup = eventHandler->GetBotGroup();\nif (botGroup != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform operations on the bot group\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot group\
      \ found with %u members\", botGroup->GetMembersCount());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Group Validity Before Use
    code: "Group* botGroup = eventHandler->GetBotGroup();\nif (botGroup && botGroup->IsLeader(playerGuid))\n\
      {\n    // Only proceed if the player is the leader of the bot group\n    botGroup->AddMember(botPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Group pointer should not be deleted or modified directly as
    it's managed by the GroupEventHandler. The method does not perform any locking
    internally, so thread safety must be ensured by the caller if used in multi-threaded
    contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized GroupEventHandler may return a
    nullptr. Always check for null before using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation
    faults. Be cautious when modifying the group through the returned pointer as it
    might affect other systems relying on the same group reference.
