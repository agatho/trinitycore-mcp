  signature: int SplineChainMovementGenerator::GetResumeInfo(const Unit * owner) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves resume information for a spline chain movement generator associated
    with the given unit.
  description: The GetResumeInfo method is used to obtain specific resume data related
    to a spline-based movement chain that is currently active for a Unit. This function
    typically returns an integer identifier or status code indicating whether the
    movement can be resumed, and under what conditions. It's commonly used in AI-driven
    movement logic where units may need to pause and later continue their pathing
    based on environmental factors or player interaction. The method does not modify
    any internal state but rather provides information about the current movement
    state for decision-making purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the resume status or identifier of the spline
    chain movement. Possible values may include 0 for successful resume, negative
    numbers for errors or invalid states, and positive values for specific resume
    codes indicating different types of continuation behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "class CustomAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        if (Unit* owner = me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator())\n\
      \        {\n            if (SplineChainMovementGenerator* chainGen = dynamic_cast<SplineChainMovementGenerator*>(owner))\n\
      \            {\n                int resumeInfo = chainGen->GetResumeInfo(me);\n\
      \                if (resumeInfo > 0)\n                {\n                  \
      \  // Proceed with resuming movement\n                    me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveSplineChain(resumeInfo);\n\
      \                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to determine if a
    paused or interrupted spline movement can be safely resumed. It's important to
    note that the returned value should be interpreted according to the specific implementation
    details of the movement generator, as different return codes may have distinct
    meanings depending on context.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling GetResumeInfo. Calling this method on an invalid or destroyed unit
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
