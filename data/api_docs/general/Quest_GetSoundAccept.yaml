documentation:
  brief: Returns the sound ID played when a player accepts a quest
  description: The GetSoundAccept method retrieves the unique sound identifier associated
    with quest acceptance in World of Warcraft. This sound is typically played when
    a player picks up a quest from an NPC or object, and it represents the audio cue
    that accompanies the quest acceptance event. The method returns a uint32 value
    which corresponds to the sound entry in the game's sound database. This value
    can be used to determine what sound should play when a quest is accepted, allowing
    developers to customize quest-related audio experiences. The method is part of
    the Quest class and is commonly used in quest scripting and event handling within
    TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the sound ID associated with quest
    acceptance. This value corresponds to an entry in the game's sound database, typically
    used for audio events when a player accepts a quest. The value may be zero if
    no sound is defined for that specific quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 soundId = quest->GetSoundAccept();\nif (soundId > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Play the sound associated with quest acceptance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods. It's important to note that the returned value
    may be zero if no sound is defined for a specific quest, which could indicate
    either missing data or an intentional absence of audio cue.
  warnings: The method does not validate whether the returned sound ID exists in the
    game's sound database; developers should ensure proper validation when using this
    value in their code. Also, the value returned may vary depending on the quest's
    specific design and may be zero for quests without sound definitions.
