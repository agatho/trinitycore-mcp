documentation:
  brief: Removes all loot from a creature's corpse after death.
  description: This method clears all loot entries from a creature's corpse, ensuring
    that no loot remains available for players to loot. It is typically called when
    a creature dies and its loot is fully distributed or when the loot system is reset.
    The method ensures that the creature's loot table is cleared of all items, preventing
    any further loot attempts from the corpse.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->AllLootRemovedFromCorpse();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after loot has been distributed or when the
    creature is being removed from the world. It may be used in conjunction with other
    methods like 'RemoveLoot' or 'ResetLoot' to ensure proper cleanup of the creature's
    loot.
  warnings: This method does not handle any potential race conditions or synchronization
    issues that might occur if multiple players attempt to loot the same corpse simultaneously.
    Care should be taken when implementing this in a multiplayer environment.
