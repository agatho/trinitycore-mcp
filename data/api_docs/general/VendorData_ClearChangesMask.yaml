  signature: void VendorData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the vendor data, resetting all modified flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with the VendorData object. This operation is typically used to indicate that
    all previously modified fields have been synchronized or committed. The changes
    mask is commonly employed in TrinityCore's update system to track which fields
    of a data structure have been altered since the last synchronization with clients.
    Calling this method effectively clears the 'dirty' flags for all vendor-related
    data, ensuring that subsequent updates will not redundantly transmit unchanged
    information.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Synchronization
    code: 'VendorData* vendorData = player->GetVendorData();

      vendorData->ClearChangesMask();

      // All vendor data fields are now considered clean and synchronized'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the update cycle when a vendor's
    data has been successfully sent to clients. It's crucial for performance optimization
    as it prevents unnecessary network traffic by avoiding retransmission of unchanged
    data.
