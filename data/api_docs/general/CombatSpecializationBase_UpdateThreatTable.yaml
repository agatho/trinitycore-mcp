documentation:
  brief: Updates the threat table for combat specializations, recalculating and synchronizing
    threat values for all involved units.
  description: The UpdateThreatTable method is responsible for recalculating and updating
    the threat values within a combat specialization's threat table. This method ensures
    that all units engaged in combat maintain accurate threat levels based on their
    actions, such as damage dealt or healing received. It typically runs during combat
    updates and helps maintain proper aggro management for mobs and players. The method
    may also synchronize threat data across different subsystems to ensure consistency
    in the game's combat mechanics.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Table Update
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* specialization = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      specialization->UpdateThreatTable();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat update cycles and should not
    be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom combat logic. It may
    trigger additional callbacks or events related to threat changes.
  warnings: Invoking this method outside of a proper combat context might lead to
    inconsistent threat states or unexpected behavior in mob AI. Avoid calling it
    repeatedly in tight loops as it could impact performance.
