documentation:
  brief: Prioritizes combat actions based on threat level and target validity
  description: The PrioritizeActions method evaluates all available combat actions
    for a unit and ranks them according to priority criteria such as threat level,
    target validity, and action type. This method is typically invoked during the
    AI decision-making process to determine which action should be executed next in
    combat. It ensures that high-priority actions like interrupting important spells
    or attacking the highest threat target are selected before lower-priority actions
    such as healing or ranged attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void MyCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    m_combatBehavior->PrioritizeActions();\n    // ... execute prioritized\
      \ action ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat AI logic and should be called regularly
    during combat updates. It modifies internal state variables that track action
    priorities, so calling it multiple times without proper state management may lead
    to unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context as it assumes valid
    target and threat information. Calling PrioritizeActions when no valid targets
    exist may result in undefined behavior or incorrect action selection.
