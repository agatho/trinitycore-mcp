  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindAreaTriggerByGuid
  signature: const DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::AreaTriggerSnapshot * SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindAreaTriggerByGuid(Player
    * bot, int guid, float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns an area trigger snapshot by its unique identifier within
    a specified search radius.
  description: The FindAreaTriggerByGuid method searches for an area trigger within
    the spatial grid of a given player, using the provided GUID to locate it. It retrieves
    a snapshot of the area trigger's current state from the double-buffered spatial
    grid system, which is used for efficient spatial queries in TrinityCore. This
    method is typically used by AI systems or game mechanics that need to interact
    with area triggers based on their unique identifiers. The search is constrained
    by a specified radius around the player's position, ensuring only relevant triggers
    are considered. The returned snapshot contains up-to-date information about the
    trigger's state and location.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the entity performing the
      search. This determines the spatial context and search boundaries.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the area
      trigger to locate within the spatial grid.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: Float value defining the maximum distance from the player's position
      to search for the area trigger. Must be a positive number.
  returns: A pointer to a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::AreaTriggerSnapshot structure
    containing the current state of the found area trigger, or nullptr if no matching
    trigger is found within the specified radius.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint triggerGuid = 12345;\nfloat radius = 50.0f;\nconst\
      \ DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::AreaTriggerSnapshot* snapshot = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindAreaTriggerByGuid(bot,\
      \ triggerGuid, radius);\nif (snapshot) {\n    // Process the area trigger data\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Found area trigger at: \" << snapshot->GetPosition().x <<\
      \ \", \" << snapshot->GetPosition().y << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with AI Decision Making
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint targetTriggerGuid = 98765;\nfloat searchRadius\
      \ = 100.0f;\nconst DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::AreaTriggerSnapshot* trigger =\
      \ SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindAreaTriggerByGuid(bot, targetTriggerGuid, searchRadius);\n\
      if (trigger && trigger->IsActive()) {\n    // AI logic to move towards or interact\
      \ with the area trigger\n    Position targetPos = trigger->GetPosition();\n\
      \    bot->MovePosition(targetPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the double-buffered spatial grid system, which maintains
    two versions of spatial data to avoid race conditions during concurrent access.
    The search is optimized for performance by leveraging spatial partitioning. The
    returned snapshot may be invalidated if the area trigger's state changes between
    the time of lookup and when it's used.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual area trigger in
    the world; otherwise, the method returns nullptr. Be cautious when using large
    search radii as they can impact performance. The returned snapshot should not
    be modified directly as it's part of a double-buffered system.
