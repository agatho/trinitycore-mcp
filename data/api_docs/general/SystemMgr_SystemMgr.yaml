  brief: Moves a SystemMgr object to another SystemMgr object, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The SystemMgr move constructor is used to transfer ownership of resources
    from one SystemMgr instance to another. This is a standard C++ move semantics
    implementation that allows for efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary
    copying. The source SystemMgr object will be left in a valid but unspecified state
    after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore, this method would typically
    be used when passing SystemMgr objects between functions or containers where moving
    is more efficient than copying. This constructor is particularly important for
    performance optimization in systems that manage game server configurations, system
    states, or other runtime data structures.

  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'SystemMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... initialize sourceMgr ...

      SystemMgr movedMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Moves resources from sourceMgr
      to movedMgr'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<SystemMgr> mgrVector;

      mgrVector.emplace_back();

      // ... populate vector ...

      SystemMgr newMgr = std::move(mgrVector.front()); // Move first element out of
      vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. After calling this constructor,
    the source object should not be used unless it's reassigned. The move constructor
    is typically generated automatically by the compiler when no user-defined move
    constructor exists, but in this case it appears to be explicitly defined for SystemMgr.
    This method is essential for performance optimization in systems that frequently
    pass around SystemMgr objects.
  warnings: Using the moved object after a move operation results in undefined behavior.
    The source object becomes invalid and should not be accessed or used in any way.
    Make sure to properly initialize or reassign the source object if you need to
    use it again.
