  class: SpatialGridScheduler
  method: UpdateAllGrids
  signature: void SpatialGridScheduler::UpdateAllGrids(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all grids in the spatial scheduler with the specified time delta.
  description: The UpdateAllGrids method iterates through all active grids managed
    by the SpatialGridScheduler and performs necessary updates for each grid based
    on the provided time delta. This method is typically called during the game loop
    to ensure that all spatially-aware objects within grids are processed correctly,
    including handling of movement, visibility changes, and other time-dependent behaviors.
    It plays a crucial role in maintaining the consistency of the world's spatial
    grid system in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta (in milliseconds) to advance the grid updates. This
      value represents how much time has passed since the last update call and is
      used to synchronize object behaviors across the grid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    m_gridScheduler.UpdateAllGrids(diff);\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Updates
    code: "void WorldObject::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... movement logic ...\n\
      \    if (IsInWorld())\n    {\n        m_gridScheduler.UpdateAllGrids(diff);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the main game loop to maintain
    grid integrity. It's designed to be efficient and avoid unnecessary processing
    by only updating grids that have active objects or pending updates. The time delta
    parameter is critical for accurate timing of object behaviors.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect time deltas can cause erratic behavior
    in object movement and visibility. Ensure that the diff value accurately reflects
    elapsed game time to maintain proper synchronization.
