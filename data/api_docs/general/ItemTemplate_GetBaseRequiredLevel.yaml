  signature: int32 ItemTemplate::GetBaseRequiredLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base required level for an item.
  description: The GetBaseRequiredLevel method retrieves the minimum character level
    required to use or equip the item. This value is typically defined in the item's
    template data and serves as a baseline requirement for item usability. The returned
    level may be modified by various game mechanics such as enchantments, buffs, or
    quest requirements, but this method specifically returns the original base value
    from the item template. This method is commonly used during item validation checks
    and UI display logic to determine if a character can use an item.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the base required level for the item. A value
    of 0 typically indicates no level requirement, while positive values indicate
    the minimum character level needed to use the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nint32\
      \ requiredLevel = itemTemplate->GetBaseRequiredLevel();\nif (requiredLevel >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    printf(\"This item requires level %d to use\\n\", requiredLevel);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Item Usability
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(67890);\n\
      int32 baseRequiredLevel = itemTemplate->GetBaseRequiredLevel();\nif (player->getLevel()\
      \ >= baseRequiredLevel)\n{\n    // Player can use the item\n    printf(\"Player\
      \ can use this item\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot use the item\n\
      \    printf(\"Player level %d is below required level %d\\n\", player->getLevel(),\
      \ baseRequiredLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns only the base required level as defined in the item template.
    It does not account for temporary modifiers such as those from quests, enchantments,
    or buffs that might affect actual usability. The returned value is typically read-only
    and should not be modified directly. This method is thread-safe as it only reads
    from immutable template data.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns the base level requirement only. Actual
    usable level requirements may differ due to game mechanics like quest completion
    or temporary buffs. Do not use this value alone for determining item usability
    in all contexts without considering other modifiers.
