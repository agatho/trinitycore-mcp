  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: RecordResourceStarvation
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceStarvation(uint32 botGuid, ResourceType
    type, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Records a resource starvation event for a bot with specified type and duration.
  description: The RecordResourceStarvation method logs an instance where a bot experiences
    resource starvation, which typically occurs when the bot's consumption of a specific
    resource exceeds its available supply over a defined period. This method is used
    internally by the ResourceMonitor class to track and analyze resource usage patterns
    for bots in the game environment. The recorded data can be used for performance
    optimization, debugging, or generating reports on resource management efficiency.
    It does not directly affect gameplay but serves as a diagnostic tool for developers
    and system administrators.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot experiencing resource starvation.
      This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in the game world.
  - name: type
    description: The type of resource that is being starved. This should be one of
      the predefined ResourceType enumeration values, such as HEALTH, MANA, or ENERGY.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration (in milliseconds) for which the bot has been experiencing
      resource starvation. This value indicates how long the shortage persisted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceStarvation(12345, ResourceType::MANA, 5000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Starvation for Health Resource
    code: 'uint32 botId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceStarvation(botId, ResourceType::HEALTH, 3000);

      // Logs a health starvation event lasting 3 seconds for bot with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other monitoring tools to
    provide comprehensive resource usage analytics. It may be called from multiple
    threads, so thread safety considerations should be taken into account during implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid corresponds to an actual active bot; otherwise, the
    logging mechanism might produce invalid entries or cause errors. Also, duration
    values should be positive integers representing real-time intervals in milliseconds.
