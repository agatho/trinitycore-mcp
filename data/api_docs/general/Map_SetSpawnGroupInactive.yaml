  class: Map
  method: SetSpawnGroupInactive
  signature: void Map::SetSpawnGroupInactive(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates a specified spawn group within the map.
  description: This method sets a spawn group to an inactive state, effectively removing
    it from the active spawning system. It is commonly used during map loading or
    when specific conditions require a group to be temporarily disabled. The method
    operates on the internal spawn group management system and can be called from
    various game mechanics contexts including instance creation, zone updates, or
    event handling. This function does not directly affect the actual objects in the
    world but rather controls their spawning behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the spawn group to deactivate. This value
      must be a valid group ID that exists within the map's spawn system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      map->SetSpawnGroupInactive(12345);

      // This will deactivate the spawn group with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during map initialization or when managing
    spawn groups for instance content. It's important to note that the actual objects
    may remain in memory but are no longer spawned into the world. The method is thread-safe
    and can be safely called from multiple threads.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to missing spawns or incorrect behavior
    during map loading. Ensure that the group ID exists before calling this function,
    as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors.
