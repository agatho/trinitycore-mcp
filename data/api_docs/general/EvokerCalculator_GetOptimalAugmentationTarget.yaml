  class: EvokerCalculator
  method: GetOptimalAugmentationTarget
  signature: int * EvokerCalculator::GetOptimalAugmentationTarget(int * caster, const
    int & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal target for augmentation based on caster
    status and ally configuration.
  description: The GetOptimalAugmentationTarget method evaluates the current state
    of a caster and its surrounding allies to determine the most beneficial target
    for applying an augmentation effect. This method is typically used in evoker class
    AI logic within TrinityCore's combat system, where the selection process considers
    factors such as health status, proximity, and threat levels of potential targets.
    The method takes into account both the caster's own state and the configuration
    of nearby allies to make an informed decision about which entity should receive
    the augmentation. It returns a pointer to an integer representing the target's
    identifier or GUID, ensuring that the augmentation is applied to the most strategic
    candidate.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the caster's current state
      and attributes. This includes health, mana, position, and other relevant properties
      needed for target evaluation.
  - name: allies
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the number of allies in
      the vicinity. This parameter helps determine how many friendly units are available
      for consideration when selecting the optimal augmentation target.
  returns: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    selected augmentation target. Returns NULL if no suitable target is found or if
    the input parameters are invalid.

  - title: Basic Usage in Evoker AI
    code: "int casterState[5] = {100, 80, 50, 30, 20}; // Health, Mana, PositionX,\
      \ PositionY, ThreatLevel\nint allyCount = 3;\nint* target = evokerCalculator->GetOptimalAugmentationTarget(casterState,\
      \ allyCount);\nif (target != nullptr) {\n    std::cout << \"Selected target\
      \ GUID: \" << *target << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No suitable\
      \ target found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "class EvokerAI {\npublic:\n    void ApplyAugmentation() {\n        int\
      \ caster[5] = {100, 90, 1000, 1200, 15};\n        int allies = GetNearbyAllyCount();\n\
      \        int* target = calculator->GetOptimalAugmentationTarget(caster, allies);\n\
      \        if (target != nullptr && *target > 0) {\n            // Apply augmentation\
      \ to the selected target\n            ApplyEffect(*target, \"Augmentation\"\
      );\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the caster array contains at least five elements
    representing health, mana, x-position, y-position, and threat level. The ally
    count should be non-negative and reflect the actual number of nearby friendly
    units. Performance-wise, this method may involve complex calculations depending
    on the number of allies and their states, so it's recommended to cache results
    when possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster pointer is valid and points to a properly initialized
    array before calling this method. Passing invalid or uninitialized data can lead
    to undefined behavior. Also, be cautious about using the returned pointer directly
    without checking for null values, as it may result in segmentation faults.
