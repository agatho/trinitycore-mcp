  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: CreateAIInstance
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::CreateAIInstance()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates a new AI instance for a bot character within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  description: The CreateAIInstance method is responsible for setting up and initializing
    a new Artificial Intelligence instance specifically designed for bot characters
    in World of Warcraft. This method typically gets invoked during the creation or
    activation phase of a bot, ensuring that all necessary AI components, behaviors,
    and state management systems are properly configured. It integrates with the core
    TrinityCore AI subsystem to assign appropriate behavior trees, decision-making
    logic, and interaction patterns to the bot. The method may also handle resource
    allocation, memory initialization, and linking the AI instance to the corresponding
    game object or player character. Precondition for successful execution includes
    that the BotAIInitializer has been properly configured with necessary parameters
    and that the target bot entity exists in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI instance was successfully created and initialized;
    otherwise, returns false if initialization failed due to missing dependencies,
    invalid configuration, or system resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Instance Creation
    code: "BotAIInitializer initializer;\nbool success = initializer.CreateAIInstance();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // AI instance is ready for use\n    printf(\"Bot AI initialized\
      \ successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n   \
      \ printf(\"Failed to initialize Bot AI.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during its lifecycle.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method
    assumes that the underlying game object for the bot has already been created and
    registered with the core systems.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper preconditions (e.g., uninitialized
    state, missing dependencies) can lead to crashes or corrupted AI states. Ensure
    all required configuration parameters are set before invoking this method.
