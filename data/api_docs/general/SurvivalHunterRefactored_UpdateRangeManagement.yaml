documentation:
  brief: Updates the range management logic for the survival hunter AI, adjusting
    targeting and spell casting based on current combat distance.
  description: The UpdateRangeManagement method is responsible for dynamically managing
    the combat range behavior of a survival hunter AI. It evaluates the distance between
    the hunter and its target, then determines appropriate actions such as moving
    closer, maintaining distance, or selecting optimal spells based on proximity.
    This method typically integrates with the hunter's overall AI decision-making
    process to ensure effective combat performance within World of Warcraft's mechanics.
    The method is called regularly during combat updates and may influence movement
    patterns, spell selection, and positioning strategies for the AI-controlled hunter.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_hunter->UpdateRangeManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be called manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The implementation
    likely involves distance calculations against target, threat evaluation, and spell
    range validation to determine optimal combat positioning.
