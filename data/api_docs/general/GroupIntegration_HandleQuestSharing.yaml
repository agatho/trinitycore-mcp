  class: GroupIntegration
  method: HandleQuestSharing
  signature: void GroupIntegration::HandleQuestSharing(Group * group, uint32 questId,
    Player * questGiver)
documentation:
  brief: Handles quest sharing within a group when a player interacts with a quest
    giver.
  description: The HandleQuestSharing method manages the distribution of quests to
    group members when a player initiates a quest from a quest giver. It ensures that
    all eligible group members receive the quest and that proper quest tracking is
    maintained across the group. This method typically gets invoked during quest acceptance
    or when a group member triggers a quest-related event. The method checks group
    membership, quest validity, and player eligibility before distributing the quest
    to other group members.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the quest. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being shared. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object acting as the quest giver. This player
      must be within interaction range and have the quest available.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Sharing in Group
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    uint32 questId =\
      \ 12345;\n    GroupIntegration::HandleQuestSharing(group, questId, player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and that the quest giver is properly
    initialized. The actual quest sharing logic may involve sending packets to clients
    and updating quest states in the database. It's important to ensure that players
    are within appropriate distance and have proper permissions before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the group exists or that the
    questId is valid can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Additionally, if the
    quest giver is not properly initialized or not in range, the quest sharing may
    fail silently or cause client-side issues.
