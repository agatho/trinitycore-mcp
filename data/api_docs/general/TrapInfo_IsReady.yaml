  brief: Checks if a trap is ready to be triggered
  description: The IsReady method determines whether a trap object has completed its
    activation delay and is currently available for triggering. This method evaluates
    the internal state of the trap, including any cooldown periods or activation timers
    that may prevent it from being triggered immediately. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, traps typically have a brief delay between placement and when
    they can be activated, and this method returns true only when that delay has expired.
    The method is commonly used in game logic to prevent immediate re-triggering of
    traps or to determine if a trap should respond to player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trap is ready to be triggered (i.e., its activation
    delay has completed), false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates
    that the trap is either in cooldown, still charging up, or has already been triggered
    and reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trap Readiness Check
    code: "if (trapInfo.IsReady()) {\n    // Trigger the trap\n    trapInfo.Trigger();\n\
      } else {\n    // Trap is not ready yet, do nothing or show cooldown message\n\
      \    SendCooldownMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsReady in Game Logic Loop
    code: "void UpdateTrapStatus(TrapInfo& trap) {\n    if (trap.IsReady()) {\n  \
      \      // Check for nearby players\n        if (PlayerInRange(trap.GetPosition()))\
      \ {\n            trap.Trigger();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently in game update loops, so performance
    is important. The implementation likely involves checking a timestamp or timer
    value against the current game time to determine readiness. It's worth noting
    that trap readiness can be affected by various factors including player proximity,
    environmental conditions, and server tick rates.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in rapid succession without proper
    cooldown handling, as it may lead to unexpected behavior if traps are triggered
    too frequently. Also, ensure that the trap object remains valid throughout the
    lifetime of the IsReady check, as accessing destroyed objects could cause undefined
    behavior.
