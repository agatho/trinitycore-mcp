  class: OutdoorPvPMgr
  method: HandleOpenGo
  signature: bool OutdoorPvPMgr::HandleOpenGo(Player * player, GameObject * go)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the opening of a game object for a player in an outdoor PvP zone.
  description: The HandleOpenGo method is responsible for processing the interaction
    when a player attempts to open a game object within an Outdoor PvP area. This
    method typically checks if the action is valid according to the current Outdoor
    PvP state, whether the player has the required permissions or conditions, and
    then performs the appropriate actions such as updating the PvP zone's control
    status or triggering related events. It integrates with the broader Outdoor PvP
    system to manage object interactions that may affect territorial control or quest
    progression.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object attempting to open the game object.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: go
    description: A pointer to the GameObject that is being opened by the player. This
      must represent a valid game object within an Outdoor PvP zone, such as a door,
      chest, or control point.
  returns: Returns true if the game object was successfully handled and processed
    for the Outdoor PvP system; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid
    state, permissions, or other conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom event handler
    code: "if (OutdoorPvPMgr::instance()->HandleOpenGo(player, go)) {\n    // Object\
      \ opened successfully\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Object opened!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to open object\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Cannot open this object.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player interaction events and must
    be thread-safe as it may be called from different threads depending on the server
    configuration. The method relies on the OutdoorPvPMgr singleton instance to determine
    active PvP zones and their states.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and go parameters are valid before calling this
    method, as passing null pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Additionally,
    this method may modify the state of the outdoor PvP zone, so it should only be
    called in appropriate contexts where such changes are expected.
