  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: GetOperationAverageTime
  signature: float MLPerformanceTracker::GetOperationAverageTime(MLOperationType operation)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average execution time for a specified performance
    operation type.
  description: The GetOperationAverageTime method retrieves the average execution
    time (in milliseconds) for a given MLPerformanceTracker::MLOperationType. This
    method is typically used to monitor and analyze performance metrics of various
    operations within the TrinityCore system, particularly in AI or machine learning
    modules. The returned value represents the arithmetic mean of all recorded execution
    times for the specified operation type since the tracker was initialized or last
    reset. This functionality supports performance tuning and debugging by providing
    insight into how long specific operations take to complete on average.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average execution time in milliseconds for
    the specified operation type. Returns 0.0f if no measurements exist for the given
    operation type or if the operation type is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Average Time for Movement Operation
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      float avgTime = tracker.GetOperationAverageTime(MLOperationType::MOVEMENT);

      std::cout << "Average movement time: " << avgTime << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Performance of AI Decision Making
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker* perfTracker = sWorld->GetMLPerformanceTracker();\n\
      if (perfTracker)\n{\n    float decisionAvg = perfTracker->GetOperationAverageTime(MLOperationType::AI_DECISION);\n\
      \    if (decisionAvg > 10.0f)\n    {\n        // Log performance warning\n \
      \       TC_LOG_WARN(\"ml\", \"AI decision making is slow: %.2f ms average\"\
      , decisionAvg);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that operation times have been previously recorded using
    appropriate tracking mechanisms. The implementation likely uses internal data
    structures to maintain running averages or sums and counts for each operation
    type. Thread safety should be considered if multiple threads are updating performance
    metrics simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that performance tracking has been enabled before calling this
    method, as it may return zero values if no measurements exist. This method does
    not validate the operation type parameter, so invalid types may result in undefined
    behavior or zero returns.
