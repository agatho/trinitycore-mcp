  class: PlayerbotPacketSniffer
  method: RouteToCategory
  signature: void PlayerbotPacketSniffer::RouteToCategory(PacketCategory category,
    WorldSession * session, const WorldPacket & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Routes a packet to its corresponding category for processing within the playerbot
    system.
  description: The RouteToCategory method is responsible for directing incoming WorldPackets
    to their appropriate handling categories within the PlayerbotPacketSniffer. This
    method determines how different types of packets should be processed based on
    their content and the current state of the playerbot. It acts as a dispatcher
    that ensures each packet is correctly categorized and handled by the appropriate
    subsystem. The method typically checks packet opcodes, session context, and other
    relevant factors to assign the packet to a specific category for further processing.
  parameters:
  - name: category
    description: The PacketCategory enum value indicating which category the packet
      should be routed to. This determines how the packet will be processed by the
      playerbot system.
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession associated with the packet. Used to identify
      the client connection and retrieve session-specific data for packet processing.
  - name: packet
    description: The WorldPacket object containing the actual packet data that needs
      to be routed to a category for processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet routing example
    code: 'PlayerbotPacketSniffer sniffer;

      WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      WorldPacket packet(CMSG_CHAT_MESSAGE, 0);

      // ... populate packet with data ...

      sniffer.RouteToCategory(PACKET_CATEGORY_CHAT, session, packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the playerbot system when processing
    incoming packets. The actual routing logic may involve checking packet opcodes
    against predefined mappings or using more complex decision-making algorithms based
    on session state and playerbot configuration.
