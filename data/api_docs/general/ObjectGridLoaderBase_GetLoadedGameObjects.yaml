  signature: uint32 ObjectGridLoaderBase::GetLoadedGameObjects() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of game objects loaded in the grid.
  description: The GetLoadedGameObjects method retrieves the number of game objects
    that have been successfully loaded into the current grid cell. This method is
    typically used during grid loading and unloading operations to track resource
    usage and ensure proper cleanup. The returned value represents the current state
    of loaded game objects within the grid's scope, which may vary as objects are
    added or removed dynamically during gameplay. This count includes all game object
    types (such as doors, chests, creatures, etc.) that are currently present in the
    grid.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of game objects currently
    loaded in the grid. Returns zero if no game objects are loaded or if the grid
    has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Check Loaded GameObject Count
    code: "uint32 loadedCount = gridLoader->GetLoadedGameObjects();\nif (loadedCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Grid contains %u game objects.\", loadedCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current grid state and should be used
    carefully in performance-critical sections. The count returned may change dynamically
    as game objects are spawned or despawned during gameplay, so repeated calls might
    yield different results.
