  class: Guild
  method: LoadMemberFromDB
  signature: bool Guild::LoadMemberFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a guild member's data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadMemberFromDB method retrieves and populates guild member information
    from the database. It is typically invoked during guild initialization or when
    adding new members to a guild. This method handles the mapping of database fields
    to internal member structures, ensuring that player data such as rank, join date,
    and officer notes are correctly loaded. The method assumes that the database connection
    is already established and that the required field data is available in the provided
    fields array.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the member data was successfully loaded from the database;
    otherwise, returns false if the operation failed or no valid data was found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Initialization
    code: "Guild* guild = new Guild();\nint fields[] = {12345, 1, 100, 200}; // Example\
      \ field values\nbool success = guild->LoadMemberFromDB(fields);\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Member data loaded successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild management system and is usually
    called by the core guild loading mechanism. It should not be invoked directly
    unless implementing custom guild member loading logic. The fields parameter is
    expected to contain properly ordered data from a database query result.
  warnings: Improperly formatted or missing field data in the fields array can lead
    to undefined behavior or failed loads. Ensure that all required database columns
    are present and correctly mapped before calling this method.
