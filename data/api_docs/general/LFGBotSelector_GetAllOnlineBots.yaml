  brief: Retrieves the count of all online bots in the LFG system
  description: The GetAllOnlineBots method enumerates and counts all currently active
    bots within the Looking For Group (LFG) system. This method is typically used
    by the LFGBotSelector class to determine how many bots are available for group
    formation or matchmaking operations. The method performs a query against the internal
    bot registry to identify bots that are marked as online and ready for LFG activities.
    It returns an integer representing the total number of bots currently in the online
    state, which can be used by other components to make decisions about group composition
    or player matching.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total count of bots that are currently
    marked as online and available within the LFG system. Returns 0 if no bots are
    online or if an error occurs during the enumeration process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LFGBotSelector selector;\nint onlineBotCount = selector.GetAllOnlineBots();\n\
      if (onlineBotCount > 0) {\n    // Proceed with LFG operations using available\
      \ bots\n    printf(\"Found %d online bots\\n\", onlineBotCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database query or iterates through an in-memory
    list of bots to determine their online status. The implementation may cache results
    for performance reasons, but this is not guaranteed. Developers should be aware
    that the returned count might change between calls if bot statuses are updated
    concurrently.
  warnings: The method assumes that all bots have proper state tracking and that the
    online status is accurately maintained. If bots are not properly marked as online
    or offline, the count may be inaccurate. Additionally, concurrent modifications
    to bot states during the enumeration process could lead to inconsistent results.
