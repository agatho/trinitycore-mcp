documentation:
  brief: Initializes experience points reward for a player based on kill statistics
  description: The _InitXP method is responsible for setting up the initial experience
    point distribution when a player is killed by another player. This method calculates
    and prepares the XP rewards that should be awarded to the killer based on various
    factors such as player levels, difficulty settings, and game mechanics. It serves
    as an internal initialization function within the KillRewarder class to prepare
    reward data before actual XP distribution occurs. The method typically gets called
    during the kill processing sequence in the game's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that was killed, used to determine base
      XP values and level-based calculations
  - name: killer
    description: Pointer to the Player object that performed the killing action, used
      to determine reward multipliers and eligibility for XP bonuses
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in kill processing
    code: "void HandlePlayerKill(Player* killer, Player* victim) {\n    KillRewarder\
      \ rewarder;\n    rewarder._InitXP(victim, killer);\n    // Proceed with XP distribution\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat system
    code: "void CombatHandler::OnPlayerKilled(Player* killer, Player* victim) {\n\
      \    if (killer && victim) {\n        KillRewarder rewarder;\n        rewarder._InitXP(victim,\
      \ killer);\n        // Additional reward processing\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the KillRewarder class and
    should not be invoked directly from outside the class hierarchy. The method assumes
    both player pointers are valid and not null. It may perform level-based calculations
    and difficulty-dependent adjustments that affect XP rewards. Implementation details
    may vary based on TrinityCore version and server configuration settings.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null player pointers as it will likely cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. This is an internal method and should not be used
    directly in custom scripts or modules without understanding the full reward processing
    flow. Incorrect usage can lead to improper XP distribution or game balance issues.
