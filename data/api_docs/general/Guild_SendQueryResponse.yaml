documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild query response to the specified session.
  description: The SendQueryResponse method is responsible for transmitting guild-related
    data back to a client session that initiated a guild query. This method typically
    handles the serialization and sending of guild information such as name, leader,
    member count, and other relevant details to the player's client. It is commonly
    invoked when a player requests guild information through the UI or API calls,
    ensuring that the client receives up-to-date guild data for display purposes.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Query Handler
    code: "void HandleGuildQuery(WorldSession* session, WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n\
      \    Guild* guild = sObjectMgr->GetGuildById(123);\n    if (guild)\n    {\n\
      \        guild->SendQueryResponse(session);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a valid guild object exists and the
    session is properly initialized. The actual data sent depends on the guild's current
    state and may include dynamic information such as online member status or guild
    achievements.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild object has been validated before calling this method
    to prevent potential null pointer exceptions. Also, be aware that sending responses
    too frequently might cause performance issues in high-traffic scenarios.
