  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum runic power value for an unholy rune resource.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the maximum possible runic power value
    that can be stored in an unholy rune resource. This value represents the upper
    limit of runic power a player can accumulate for their unholy death knight specialization.
    The returned value is typically used in calculations involving runic power generation,
    consumption, and display. This method does not modify any internal state and is
    purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum runic power that can be stored
    in the unholy rune resource. This value is constant for a given player's specialization
    and level.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve maximum runic power for unholy death knight
    code: 'UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource* resource = player->GetRuneResource(RUNE_TYPE_UNHOLY);

      uint32 maxRunicPower = resource->GetMax();

      printf("Maximum runic power: %u\n", maxRunicPower);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the rune resource management system in TrinityCore.
    The maximum runic power value may vary based on player level and specialization,
    but for unholy death knights it typically returns a fixed value that reflects
    their resource capacity.
