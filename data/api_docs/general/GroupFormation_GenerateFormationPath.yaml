  method: GenerateFormationPath
  signature: int GroupFormation::GenerateFormationPath(const int & destination) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a formation path to the specified destination for group members
  description: The GenerateFormationPath method calculates and returns the optimal
    movement path for a group of players to reach a given destination while maintaining
    formation. This method is typically used in group-based gameplay mechanics such
    as raid encounters, quest groups, or coordinated player movements. The returned
    integer represents the path identifier or status code indicating success or failure
    of path generation. The method operates on the current group's formation data
    and considers factors like player positions, movement constraints, and destination
    coordinates to compute a valid formation path.
  parameters:
  - name: destination
    description: The target location identifier or coordinate for the group formation
      path. This parameter specifies where the group should move while maintaining
      formation. Valid values are typically integer identifiers representing specific
      locations in the game world, such as zone IDs, waypoint indices, or destination
      coordinates.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the result of path generation. A
    positive value typically indicates successful path creation with the value representing
    a unique path identifier. Zero or negative values may indicate failure conditions
    such as invalid destination, path calculation errors, or group formation constraints
    that prevent valid path generation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for generating a formation path
    code: "int pathId = groupFormation->GenerateFormationPath(12345);\nif (pathId\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Path successfully generated\n    printf(\"Formation path ID:\
      \ %d\\n\", pathId);\n} else {\n    // Handle path generation failure\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to generate formation path\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using formation path in group movement logic
    code: "GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\nint destinationId\
      \ = GetNextQuestObjective(player);\nint pathResult = formation->GenerateFormationPath(destinationId);\n\
      \nif (pathResult > 0) {\n    // Start moving along the generated path\n    player->SetFormationPath(pathResult);\n\
      \    player->MoveToDestination();\n} else {\n    // Fallback to direct movement\
      \ or notify player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"Unable to generate formation\
      \ path.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in group-based gameplay scenarios where coordinated
    movement is required. The implementation likely involves pathfinding algorithms
    that consider group size, individual player positions, and movement capabilities.
    Performance may be impacted by large groups or complex terrain. The method should
    only be called when the group has a valid formation configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group formation setup may result in
    undefined behavior or path generation failures. The destination parameter must
    be validated before calling to ensure it represents a valid location within the
    game world. This method does not perform actual movement - it only generates the
    path data for subsequent use.
