documentation:
  brief: Initializes the quest strategy triggers for the AI system
  description: The InitializeTriggers method sets up and configures all necessary
    triggers that govern how an AI-controlled character interacts with quests in the
    World of Warcraft environment. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of a quest strategy instance, establishing the conditions under which various
    quest-related actions will be executed. It prepares the internal trigger system
    to respond to events such as quest acceptance, completion, objective progression,
    and other quest-related state changes within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Trigger Initialization
    code: 'QuestStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeTriggers();

      // Triggers are now active and will respond to quest events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifecycle of a QuestStrategy
    instance. Reinitializing triggers may cause unexpected behavior or duplicate event
    handling. The method is typically invoked automatically by the AI system when
    a quest strategy is assigned to an NPC.
