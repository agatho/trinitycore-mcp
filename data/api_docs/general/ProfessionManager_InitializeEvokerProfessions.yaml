  signature: void ProfessionManager::InitializeEvokerProfessions()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes evoker-specific professions and their associated data within
    the ProfessionManager.
  description: The InitializeEvokerProfessions method sets up all necessary profession
    entries, recipes, and related data structures specific to evokers in the game.
    This method is typically called during server initialization or when a new evoker
    character is created to ensure that evoker-specific crafting abilities are properly
    registered and available. It handles loading of evoker profession trees, skill
    levels, and any unique mechanics tied to evoker crafting such as magical infusion
    or soulbinding processes. The method ensures that all evoker professions are correctly
    linked to the player's character data and that the profession system recognizes
    evoker-specific requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ProfessionManager* pm = sWorld->GetProfessionManager();

      pm->InitializeEvokerProfessions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or character
    creation. It modifies global profession data structures and may impact performance
    if called repeatedly. The method assumes that core profession systems are already
    initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method after initial server setup may cause unexpected behavior
    or data corruption. Ensure all evoker-specific profession data is properly loaded
    before invoking this method.
