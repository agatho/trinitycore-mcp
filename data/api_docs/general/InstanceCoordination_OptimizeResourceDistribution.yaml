  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: OptimizeResourceDistribution
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::OptimizeResourceDistribution(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes resource distribution for a group within an instance coordination
    system.
  description: The OptimizeResourceDistribution method adjusts and reallocates resources
    such as loot, quest items, and spawn rates among group members in a coordinated
    instance environment. This ensures balanced gameplay by preventing resource hoarding
    and maintaining fairness across all players. The method typically evaluates the
    current distribution state of resources within the instance and modifies it based
    on group composition, player levels, and instance difficulty settings. It may
    also consider player roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) to ensure optimal resource
    allocation for each role's needs.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose resources
      should be optimized. This parameter is required and must point to a valid group
      instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->OptimizeResourceDistribution(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Instance Context
    code: "InstanceMap* instanceMap = player->GetInstanceMap();\nif (instanceMap &&\
      \ instanceMap->IsDungeon())\n{\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n   \
      \ if (group)\n    {\n        instanceCoordination->OptimizeResourceDistribution(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during instance entry or when a new player
    joins an existing group. It may trigger internal recalculations of loot settings
    and spawn timers to maintain optimal distribution across all players in the group.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    within the instance coordination system.
