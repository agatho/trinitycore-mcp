  class: VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker
  method: CanUse
  signature: bool VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker::CanUse() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability can be used by the
    player.
  description: The CanUse method evaluates the current state of the Vengeance Demon
    Spikes tracker to determine if the ability is available for use. This includes
    checking cooldown status, resource requirements, and any other game mechanics
    that might prevent usage. The method returns true if all conditions are met and
    the ability can be activated, otherwise it returns false. This functionality is
    typically used in conjunction with spell or ability activation logic within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the Vengeance Demon Spikes ability can
    currently be used. Returns true if all preconditions are satisfied and the ability
    is ready to activate, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage check
    code: "if (vengeanceTracker->CanUse()) {\n    // Activate Vengeance Demon Spikes\n\
      \    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_VENGEANCE_DEMON_SPIKES, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell casting system
    code: "class PlayerSpellHandler {\npublic:\n    bool CanCastVengeanceDemonSpikes(Player*\
      \ player) {\n        VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker* tracker = player->GetVengeanceDemonSpikesTracker();\n\
      \        return tracker && tracker->CanUse();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal cooldown timers, resource availability
    (such as rage or energy), and any temporary buffs or debuffs that might affect
    ability usage. The implementation may be tied to the player's current class specialization
    and talent tree.
  warnings: Do not assume that a return value of true guarantees successful spell
    casting, as additional validation may occur during the actual spell execution
    phase. Also, this method should only be called on valid tracker instances to avoid
    potential null pointer exceptions.
