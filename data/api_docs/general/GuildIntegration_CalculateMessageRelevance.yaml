api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: CalculateMessageRelevance
  signature: float GuildIntegration::CalculateMessageRelevance(int * player, const
    GuildChatMessage & message)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the relevance score of a guild chat message for a specific player
    based on various factors such as message type, player's guild membership status,
    and recent activity.
  description: 'The CalculateMessageRelevance method determines how relevant a given
    guild chat message is to a particular player. It evaluates multiple criteria including
    whether the player is a member of the guild that sent the message, the type of
    message (e.g., general, officer, recruitment), the player''s current guild permissions,
    and recent interaction history with the guild. This relevance score influences
    how messages are prioritized or displayed in the client UI. The method returns
    a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no relevance and 1.0 represents
    maximum relevance. Precondition: The player pointer must be valid and point to
    an initialized Player object. Postcondition: The returned float value reflects
    the computed relevance score based on internal guild integration logic.'
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the relevance is being calculated.
      Must not be null and should represent a valid player instance within the game
      world.
  - name: message
    description: Reference to the GuildChatMessage structure containing details about
      the message being evaluated, including type, content, sender, and timestamp.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the calculated relevance
    score of the guild chat message for the specified player. Higher values indicate
    greater relevance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Player* myPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid player instance\nGuildChatMessage\
      \ msg;\nmsg.type = GUILD_CHAT_TYPE_OFFICER;\nmsg.sender = \"Officer1\";\nmsg.content\
      \ = \"Meeting at 20:00 tonight.\";\nfloat relevance = guildIntegration->CalculateMessageRelevance(myPlayer,\
      \ msg);\nif (relevance > 0.5f) {\n    // Display message as relevant\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with multiple messages
    code: "std::vector<GuildChatMessage> messages = GetRecentGuildMessages();\nPlayer*\
      \ player = GetActivePlayer();\nfor (const auto& msg : messages) {\n    float\
      \ relevance = guildIntegration->CalculateMessageRelevance(player, msg);\n  \
      \  if (relevance >= 0.7f) {\n        // Prioritize display or notification for\
      \ high-relevance messages\n        NotifyPlayerOfImportantGuildMessage(player,\
      \ msg);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal caching mechanisms to improve performance
    when evaluating the same player against multiple messages. The relevance calculation
    may also consider factors like the player's last login time, guild rank, and recent
    chat activity.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is always valid before calling this method;
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also note that the exact
    algorithm used for calculating relevance might change with game updates or patches.
