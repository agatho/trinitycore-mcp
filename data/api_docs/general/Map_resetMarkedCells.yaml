documentation:
  brief: Clears all marked cells from the map, resetting their state to unmarked.
  description: The resetMarkedCells method clears all previously marked cells on the
    map, effectively resetting their state to unmarked. This is typically used during
    map updates or when transitioning between different game states where cell marking
    needs to be cleared. The method operates on the internal data structures that
    track which cells have been marked, ensuring no stale markings persist. It's commonly
    called during map loading, unloading, or reset operations to maintain consistency
    in the map's cell state tracking system.

  - title: Basic usage in map reset operation
    code: "void Map::HandleMapReset()\n{\n    // Reset all marked cells before reloading\
      \ the map\n    resetMarkedCells();\n    // Continue with map loading logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core map management system.
    It's important to understand that marking cells usually relates to pathfinding,
    visibility calculations, or other spatial operations. The method does not affect
    the actual map data, only the marking state of cells.
