  signature: MovementResult RoleBasedCombatPositioning::UpdateCombatPosition(Player
    * bot, const CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat position of a player bot based on role-based positioning
    logic.
  description: The UpdateCombatPosition method adjusts the positioning of a player
    bot within combat scenarios according to predefined role-based rules. It evaluates
    the current combat context, including target position, bot's role (e.g., tank,
    healer, damage dealer), and environmental factors to determine an optimal positioning
    strategy. This method is typically invoked during combat updates to ensure that
    bots maintain appropriate positioning for their designated roles, enhancing group
    coordination and overall combat effectiveness. The method returns a MovementResult
    indicating whether the positioning update was successful or if any movement constraints
    were encountered.
  parameters: []
  returns: A MovementResult enum value indicating the outcome of the positioning update.
    Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending on
    whether the bot's position could be adjusted successfully within the combat context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void CombatAI::Update()\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n    {\n  \
      \      CombatPositionContext context;\n        // Populate context with current\
      \ target and environment data\n        MovementResult result = m_positioning.UpdateCombatPosition(bot,\
      \ context);\n        if (result == MovementResult::SUCCESS)\n        {\n   \
      \         // Positioning updated successfully\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the role-based combat AI system and relies on accurate
    context data being passed in the CombatPositionContext. The positioning logic
    may involve pathfinding, obstacle avoidance, and role-specific positioning constraints.
    Performance can be impacted by complex pathfinding calculations during high-frequency
    updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the CombatPositionContext is properly populated before calling
    this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should not be
    called outside of combat scenarios unless specifically designed for non-combat
    positioning.
