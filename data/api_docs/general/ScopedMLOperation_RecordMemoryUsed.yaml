  class: ScopedMLOperation
  method: RecordMemoryUsed
  signature: void ScopedMLOperation::RecordMemoryUsed(uint64_t bytes)
documentation:
  brief: Records the amount of memory used by a scoped memory operation.
  description: The RecordMemoryUsed method is used to track and log the amount of
    memory consumed during a specific scoped memory operation. This method is typically
    called internally by the TrinityCore framework to monitor memory usage patterns,
    particularly in systems that manage dynamic allocations such as those related
    to map loading or object management. It allows for detailed profiling and debugging
    of memory consumption within the game engine's memory management subsystem. The
    method does not perform any direct memory allocation or deallocation but rather
    updates internal tracking structures with the provided byte count.
  parameters:
  - name: bytes
    description: The number of bytes of memory used by the scoped operation. This
      value should be a non-negative integer representing the total memory footprint
      in bytes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ScopedMLOperation operation;

      // ... perform some memory-intensive operations ...

      operation.RecordMemoryUsed(1024); // Records 1KB of memory usage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Map Loading Context
    code: "void LoadMapData(uint32 mapId) {\n    ScopedMLOperation mlOperation;\n\
      \    // Simulate loading map data\n    uint64 totalBytes = CalculateMapMemoryUsage(mapId);\n\
      \    mlOperation.RecordMemoryUsed(totalBytes);\n    // Continue with map loading\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other memory tracking utilities
    within TrinityCore's memory management system. It's important to note that this
    method does not directly manage memory but rather serves as a reporting mechanism
    for memory consumption. The actual memory allocation and deallocation are handled
    by lower-level memory managers.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bytes' parameter accurately reflects the memory usage
    of the operation being tracked. Incorrect values can lead to misleading profiling
    data and make debugging more difficult. This method should not be called with
    negative values as it may cause unexpected behavior in internal tracking systems.
