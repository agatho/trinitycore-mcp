  signature: void ProfessionManager::~ProfessionManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ProfessionManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ProfessionManager class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures, unregistering callbacks, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures proper cleanup when a player's
    profession data is no longer needed, such as during character logout or server
    shutdown. The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope end
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    ProfessionManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of dynamic instance
    code: 'ProfessionManager* manager = new ProfessionManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It is important to ensure that all references to the manager are cleared
    before destruction to prevent use-after-free errors. In TrinityCore, this destructor
    may also handle cleanup of database connections or cached profession data.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it will
    be called automatically. Be cautious when using smart pointers or manual memory
    management with this class to avoid double-deletion issues.
