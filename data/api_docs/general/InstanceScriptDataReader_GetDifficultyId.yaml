  method: GetDifficultyId
  signature: int InstanceScriptDataReader::GetDifficultyId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the difficulty identifier for the current instance.
  description: The GetDifficultyId method returns the difficulty level of the current
    instance. This identifier corresponds to the game's difficulty settings such as
    Normal, Heroic, or Mythic modes. The returned value is typically used to determine
    which set of rules, loot tables, or encounter mechanics should be applied during
    instance gameplay. This method is commonly called during instance initialization
    or when evaluating player progress and rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current instance's difficulty ID. Valid values
    are typically 0 for Normal, 1 for Heroic, 2 for 25-player Normal, 3 for 25-player
    Heroic, and higher values for Mythic difficulties depending on the expansion level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        int difficultyId = GetDifficultyId();\n \
      \       if (difficultyId == 1)\n        {\n            // Apply Heroic-specific\
      \ logic\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called within the context of an active instance
    script. The difficulty ID returned is determined by the instance's configuration
    and player group settings at the time of entry.
