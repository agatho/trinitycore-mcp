  class: GameObject
  method: GetGoArtKit
  signature: uint32 GameObject::GetGoArtKit() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the game object art kit ID associated with the GameObject.
  description: The GetGoArtKit method retrieves the art kit ID that defines how the
    GameObject appears in the game world. This ID is used by the client to determine
    which visual assets to display for the GameObject, including its model, animation,
    and other graphical elements. The method is typically used during object spawning
    or rendering processes to ensure proper visual representation of game objects.
    It's important to note that this value may be zero if no art kit has been assigned
    to the GameObject.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the art kit ID associated with the GameObject.
    This ID is used by the client to determine which visual assets to display for
    the GameObject, including its model, animation, and other graphical elements.
    A value of zero indicates that no art kit has been assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 artKitId = gameobject->GetGoArtKit();\nif (artKitId > 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Use the artKitId for rendering\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle no art kit case\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObject's internal data structure and should
    be used carefully during object lifecycle management. Performance considerations
    are minimal since this is a simple getter method, but it's important to understand
    that the art kit ID directly affects visual rendering.
  warnings: The art kit ID may be zero for objects that haven't been assigned an art
    kit, which could lead to incorrect visual representation if not handled properly
    in code. Avoid using this value without checking for validity.
