documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the CollisionPrediction class for handling
    collision detection logic.
  description: The CollisionPrediction constructor initializes a new instance of the
    CollisionPrediction class, setting up internal data structures and state required
    for performing collision predictions in the game world. This class is typically
    used to determine whether objects (such as creatures, players, or projectiles)
    will collide with each other or environmental obstacles during movement or action
    execution. The initialization process may involve preparing spatial partitioning
    data structures, loading relevant collision masks, and configuring prediction
    parameters based on object types and game mechanics. It's important to note that
    this constructor does not perform actual collision detection; rather, it sets
    up the necessary infrastructure for subsequent collision prediction operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'CollisionPrediction prediction;

      // The prediction object is now ready to be used for collision detection

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Movement Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player, Position targetPos)\n{\n    CollisionPrediction\
      \ prediction;\n    // Configure prediction settings based on player and target\n\
      \    // Perform collision check before allowing movement\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when objects requiring collision prediction are created. Developers should not
    need to manually instantiate this class unless implementing custom collision detection
    logic. The initialization process may involve memory allocation and setup of spatial
    data structures that could impact performance if called excessively in tight loops.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the underlying
    implementation details. Improper usage can lead to undefined behavior or memory
    corruption. The class assumes certain game state contexts are properly initialized
    before use, particularly related to world object management and spatial partitioning
    systems.
