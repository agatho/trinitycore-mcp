  method: GetWidePlayerName
  signature: const std::wstring & WhoListPlayerInfo::GetWidePlayerName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the wide character string representation of the player's name stored
    in the WhoListPlayerInfo object.
  description: The GetWidePlayerName method retrieves the player's name as a wide
    character string (std::wstring) from the WhoListPlayerInfo class. This is typically
    used in the context of the 'who' command or player listing functionality within
    TrinityCore's World Server. The returned reference provides direct access to the
    internal wide string storage, avoiding unnecessary copying. The method is const,
    meaning it does not modify the object's state. This implementation assumes that
    the WhoListPlayerInfo object has already been initialized with a valid player
    name, which would typically be set during the construction or population of the
    object from game data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::wstring containing the wide character representation
    of the player's name. The string is guaranteed to be valid and null-terminated
    if the WhoListPlayerInfo object was properly initialized with a player name.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Who Command Handler
    code: 'WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;

      // ... populate playerInfo with data ...

      const std::wstring& playerName = playerInfo.GetWidePlayerName();

      std::wcout << L"Player: " << playerName << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned std::wstring reference points to internal storage within the
    WhoListPlayerInfo object. Modifying this string through the returned reference
    will directly affect the object's state. This method is optimized for performance
    by returning a const reference rather than a copy, but developers should be aware
    that the underlying data may change if the WhoListPlayerInfo object itself is
    modified elsewhere.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing or using the returned reference beyond the lifetime
    of the WhoListPlayerInfo object, as this could lead to dangling references. Also,
    ensure that the object was properly initialized with a valid player name before
    calling this method, otherwise the behavior may be undefined.
