  class: FollowerAI
  method: OwnerAttackedBy
  signature: void FollowerAI::OwnerAttackedBy(int * other)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when the follower's owner is attacked by another unit.
  description: The OwnerAttackedBy method is invoked in the FollowerAI class to process
    situations where the player who owns the follower creature is under attack. This
    method typically triggers the follower to respond to the threat, potentially engaging
    the attacker or taking defensive actions. It is part of the AI behavior system
    that governs how follower creatures react to combat situations involving their
    owner. The method does not directly perform any combat actions itself but serves
    as a callback for the AI to determine its appropriate response.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the identifier or type of the
      unit that attacked the owner. This parameter may contain information about the
      attacking entity's GUID or other identifying data used internally by the TrinityCore
      framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom AI logic
    code: "class MyFollowerAI : public FollowerAI {\npublic:\n    void OwnerAttackedBy(int*\
      \ other) override {\n        // Custom logic when owner is attacked\n      \
      \  if (other != nullptr) {\n            // Log the attack or trigger specific\
      \ behavior\n            sLog->outString(\"Follower's owner was attacked by unit\
      \ %d\", *other);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core AI update loop when
    an event occurs indicating that the owner of the follower has been targeted or
    attacked. It's important to note that this method may be overridden in custom
    AI implementations to provide specific behaviors for different types of followers.
  warnings: Ensure proper handling of the 'other' parameter, as it is a pointer and
    could potentially be null. Always validate input before dereferencing to avoid
    crashes or undefined behavior.
