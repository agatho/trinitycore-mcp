documentation:
  brief: Applies a charge destination effect to the spell target
  description: The EffectChargeDest method handles the execution of charge-based spell
    effects, where the caster moves toward the target location. This method typically
    occurs during spell cast completion and involves movement mechanics that allow
    for teleportation or movement towards a specified destination point. It is commonly
    used in spells that require the caster to move closer to the target, such as charge
    abilities or certain area-of-effect spells.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell execution and requires proper
    handling of movement mechanics. It may involve collision detection and pathfinding
    to ensure the target location is valid.
  warnings: Care must be taken when implementing this method as it can cause unexpected
    movement behavior if not properly handled with respect to target position and
    collision detection.
