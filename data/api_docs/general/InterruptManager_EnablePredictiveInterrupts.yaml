  class: InterruptManager
  method: EnablePredictiveInterrupts
  signature: void InterruptManager::EnablePredictiveInterrupts(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables predictive interrupts within the InterruptManager.
  description: The EnablePredictiveInterrupts method controls whether predictive interrupt
    logic is active in the InterruptManager. When enabled, the system will attempt
    to predict and handle interrupts before they occur, improving responsiveness during
    combat. This feature is typically used to enhance player experience by reducing
    the delay between interrupt triggers and their execution. The method does not
    perform any validation on the input parameter, and the change takes effect immediately
    upon calling the function.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value that determines whether predictive interrupts should
      be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Predictive Interrupts
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = ...;

      interruptMgr->EnablePredictiveInterrupts(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Predictive Interrupts
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = ...;

      interruptMgr->EnablePredictiveInterrupts(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore framework to manage
    combat state transitions and should be called carefully in performance-critical
    sections. The predictive interrupt system may have additional dependencies or
    configurations that must be set up before enabling this feature.
