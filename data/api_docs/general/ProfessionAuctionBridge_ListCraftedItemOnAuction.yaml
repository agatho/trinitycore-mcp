    uint32 itemGuid, const CraftedItemAuctionConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Lists a crafted item on the auction house using the specified configuration.
  description: The ListCraftedItemOnAuction method attempts to list a crafted item
    owned by a player on the auction house. It uses the provided configuration to
    determine auction parameters such as duration, starting bid, and buyout price.
    The method requires the player to have the item in their inventory and ensures
    the item is valid for auctioning. This function is typically used within crafting
    profession systems where players can auction items they've crafted directly from
    their inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must be a valid player GUID or nullptr.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the crafted item to be listed on
      auction. Must correspond to an existing item in the player's inventory.
  - name: config
    description: Configuration object containing auction settings such as duration,
      starting bid, and buyout price for the item being listed.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully listed on the auction house;
    otherwise returns false. Failure may occur due to invalid player GUID, missing
    item, or invalid auction configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 itemId = 67890;\nCraftedItemAuctionConfig\
      \ config;\nconfig.duration = AUCTION_DURATION_12HOURS;\nconfig.startBid = 1000;\n\
      config.buyoutPrice = 5000;\nbool result = bridge->ListCraftedItemOnAuction(&playerId,\
      \ itemId, config);\nif (result) {\n    // Item successfully listed\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to list item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 itemId = 67890;\nCraftedItemAuctionConfig\
      \ config;\nconfig.duration = AUCTION_DURATION_24HOURS;\nconfig.startBid = 2500;\n\
      config.buyoutPrice = 10000;\n\nif (playerId <= 0 || itemId == 0) {\n    // Invalid\
      \ input parameters\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool success = bridge->ListCraftedItemOnAuction(&playerId,\
      \ itemId, config);\nif (!success) {\n    // Log error or notify player\n   \
      \ sLog->outError(\"Failed to list crafted item %u on auction for player %d\"\
      , itemId, playerId);\n}\nreturn success;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the player has sufficient permissions and that the item
    is valid for auctioning. It does not perform checks on item restrictions or auction
    house limits beyond basic validity. The method may block if it needs to interact
    with database operations during listing.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID and item GUID are valid before calling this
    function, as invalid values can lead to undefined behavior or database corruption.
    Also ensure that the configuration parameters are within acceptable ranges for
    auction house rules.
