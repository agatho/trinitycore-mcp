  method: InitializeSynergyMatrix
  signature: void RoleOptimizer::InitializeSynergyMatrix()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the synergy matrix used by the role optimizer to determine optimal
    player role assignments.
  description: The InitializeSynergyMatrix method sets up the internal data structure
    that stores synergy values between different roles in a group context. This matrix
    is essential for the role optimizer's decision-making process, determining how
    well players with specific roles work together. The method typically populates
    this matrix based on predefined role interactions and player capabilities within
    the TrinityCore framework. It must be called before any role optimization calculations
    can be performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeSynergyMatrix();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a role optimization system. Reinitializing the matrix may cause loss of previously
    calculated synergy data.
