  class: ObjectGUIDCheck
  method: ObjectGUIDCheck
  signature: void ObjectGUIDCheck::ObjectGUIDCheck(int GUID)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an ObjectGUIDCheck instance with a specified GUID value
  description: The ObjectGUIDCheck constructor initializes a new instance of the ObjectGUIDCheck
    class with the provided GUID parameter. This class is typically used for validating
    or checking the validity of GameObject or Unit GUIDs within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method sets up internal state to track or verify the given GUID, which is
    essential for maintaining object references and ensuring proper game state management.
    The constructor does not perform any validation on the input GUID itself, relying
    on the caller to provide a valid identifier.
  parameters:
  - name: GUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) to initialize the ObjectGUIDCheck with.
      This should be a valid GameObject or Unit GUID from the TrinityCore database
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ObjectGUIDCheck Initialization
    code: 'ObjectGUIDCheck check(12345);

      // Creates a new ObjectGUIDCheck instance with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ObjectGUIDCheck with GameObject GUID
    code: 'uint32 gameObjGuid = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(1234)->GetGUID();

      ObjectGUIDCheck check(gameObjGuid);

      // Initializes check with a valid GameObject GUID from the object manager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by TrinityCore's core systems
    when performing GUID-based lookups or validations. The class likely serves as
    part of a larger validation framework for ensuring object references remain consistent
    throughout the game world.
