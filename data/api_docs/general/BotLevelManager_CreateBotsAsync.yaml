  signature: uint32 BotLevelManager::CreateBotsAsync(const int & bots)
documentation:
  brief: Asynchronously creates a specified number of bots and returns the total count
    of successfully created bots.
  description: The CreateBotsAsync method initiates the asynchronous creation process
    for a given number of bots within the TrinityCore environment. This method is
    typically used in bot management systems to spawn multiple bots concurrently without
    blocking the main thread. The method takes an integer parameter representing the
    desired number of bots to create and returns a uint32 value indicating how many
    bots were successfully created. It's designed to handle potential failures gracefully,
    ensuring that partial creation scenarios are handled properly. The implementation
    likely leverages asynchronous task scheduling or threading mechanisms to avoid
    performance bottlenecks during bot creation.
  parameters:
  - name: bots
    description: An integer value specifying the number of bots to create asynchronously.
      Must be a non-negative integer. Values exceeding system limits may result in
      fewer bots being created than requested.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of bots successfully
    created. This number may be less than the requested count if some bot creation
    operations fail or are limited by system resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Creation
    code: 'uint32 createdBots = botLevelManager->CreateBotsAsync(5);

      // Creates 5 bots asynchronously and stores the number of successfully created
      bots in ''createdBots'''
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Partial Creation
    code: "int requestedCount = 10;\nuint32 actualCreated = botLevelManager->CreateBotsAsync(requestedCount);\n\
      if (actualCreated < requestedCount) {\n    // Log warning about partial creation\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Only %u out of %d bots were created.\", actualCreated,\
      \ requestedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates asynchronously, meaning it returns immediately after
    initiating the bot creation tasks. The actual bot creation may continue in background
    threads or scheduled tasks. Developers should be aware that the returned count
    reflects only successful creations and not all requested bots. Performance considerations
    include potential resource contention when creating many bots simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with a very large number of bots may lead to system
    resource exhaustion or performance degradation. The method does not validate input
    parameters beyond ensuring they are non-negative, so invalid values could cause
    unexpected behavior. Ensure proper error handling and logging around bot creation
    operations as failures might occur silently.
