  class: InteractionManager
  method: SetMaxInteractionAttempts
  signature: void InteractionManager::SetMaxInteractionAttempts(uint8 attempts)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of interaction attempts allowed for an object.
  description: The SetMaxInteractionAttempts method configures the maximum number
    of times a player or creature can attempt to interact with a specific game object
    before the interaction is considered exhausted. This mechanism helps prevent spamming
    or infinite loops during interaction sequences, particularly useful in quest systems,
    vendor interactions, or scripted events. The value is typically set based on game
    design requirements and can be adjusted per-object or globally depending on implementation.
    Setting this value too low may prevent legitimate interactions, while setting
    it too high could allow abuse or performance issues.
  parameters:
  - name: attempts
    description: The maximum number of interaction attempts allowed (0-255). A value
      of 0 disables further interactions, while higher values allow more attempts.
      Valid range is typically 1-255 for practical use cases.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Interaction Attempts
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = player->GetInteractionManager();

      manager->SetMaxInteractionAttempts(3); // Allow up to 3 interaction attempts'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Further Interactions
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = object->GetInteractionManager();

      manager->SetMaxInteractionAttempts(0); // Prevent any further interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal counter or flag within the InteractionManager
    class. The actual interaction logic and attempt tracking should be handled by
    other methods in the same class. Consider that this value may be overridden by
    quest-specific configurations or global server settings.
  warnings: Setting attempts to 0 will completely disable interactions, which might
    break quest progression or object functionality. Ensure that any interaction limit
    is sufficient for normal gameplay but restrictive enough to prevent abuse. This
    method should not be called during active interaction sequences as it may cause
    unexpected behavior.
