documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CachedItem object with default values.
  description: The CachedItem constructor initializes a new instance of the CachedItem
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the cached item, preparing it
    for use in the TrinityCore auction house system or other item caching mechanisms.
    The constructor typically initializes member variables to their default states,
    ensuring that the object is in a valid condition before being used. In World of
    Warcraft's context, this would be part of the item caching infrastructure that
    helps optimize performance when dealing with large numbers of items in systems
    like the auction house.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new CachedItem instance
    code: 'CachedItem newItem;

      // Initializes a new CachedItem object with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating cached item entries. Developers should not need to explicitly call
    this constructor unless they are implementing custom caching logic or extending
    the auction house functionality.
