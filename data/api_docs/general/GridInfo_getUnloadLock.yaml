  signature: bool GridInfo::getUnloadLock() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the grid is currently locked for unloading
  description: The getUnloadLock method returns a boolean value indicating whether
    the grid is currently locked from being unloaded. This lock prevents the grid
    from being removed from memory when no players are present, which is crucial for
    maintaining world state consistency during ongoing operations such as combat,
    quest progression, or object spawning. The lock typically gets acquired when objects
    within the grid require processing or when there are active references to entities
    in that grid area.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the grid is currently locked from unloading, false otherwise. A
    true return value indicates that the grid will not be removed even if no players
    are present.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Grid is Locked Before Unloading
    code: "if (!gridInfo->getUnloadLock()) {\n    // Safe to unload grid\n    gridInfo->unload();\n\
      } else {\n    // Grid is locked, defer unloading\n    gridInfo->setUnloadTimer(5000);\
      \ // Retry in 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore grid management
    system. It's important to understand that holding an unload lock for extended
    periods can lead to memory leaks or performance degradation if not properly managed.
  warnings: Using this method without proper understanding of grid lifecycle management
    may result in unexpected behavior, including memory leaks or inconsistent world
    states during server operation.
