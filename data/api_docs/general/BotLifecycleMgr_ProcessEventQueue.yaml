  method: ProcessEventQueue
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::ProcessEventQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all pending bot lifecycle events in the queue.
  description: The ProcessEventQueue method iterates through and executes all queued
    bot lifecycle events, ensuring that each event is handled according to its type
    and priority. This method is typically called during the game loop to maintain
    synchronization between the bot management system and the overall world state.
    It handles events such as bot creation, destruction, state transitions, and other
    lifecycle-related operations. The method ensures that no events are skipped or
    processed out of order by maintaining a strict queue processing sequence.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sBotLifecycleMgr->ProcessEventQueue();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the main game loop to ensure timely
    processing of bot lifecycle events. It is designed to be thread-safe and can be
    safely invoked from different threads as long as proper synchronization mechanisms
    are in place.
