  method: GetSubscriberCount
  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::GetSubscriberCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of subscribers currently registered with the group
    event bus.
  description: The GetSubscriberCount method retrieves the current count of all active
    subscribers to events within the GroupEventBus. This count represents how many
    entities (such as players, NPCs, or systems) are currently listening for events
    broadcast through this specific event bus instance. The method is typically used
    for debugging, monitoring, or performance optimization purposes to understand
    the event subscription load. It provides a read-only snapshot of subscriber activity
    at the time of invocation and does not modify any internal state. This functionality
    is particularly relevant in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment where
    group-based events are common during player interactions, instance management,
    and quest progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of subscribers currently registered
    with the GroupEventBus. Returns zero if no subscribers are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Subscription Count
    code: 'GroupEventBus* eventBus = sGroupEventBus->GetGroupEventBus(groupId);

      uint32 subscriberCount = eventBus->GetSubscriberCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Current subscriber count for group %u: %u", groupId,
      subscriberCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Subscriber Count for Performance Debugging
    code: "void DebugGroupEventBus(uint32 groupId)\n{\n    GroupEventBus* bus = sGroupEventBus->GetGroupEventBus(groupId);\n\
      \    if (bus)\n    {\n        uint32 count = bus->GetSubscriberCount();\n  \
      \      if (count > 100)\n        {\n            TC_LOG_WARN(\"server\", \"High\
      \ subscriber count detected for group %u: %u\", groupId, count);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter and is
    generally fast. However, in high-frequency event systems, frequent calls to this
    method may impact performance if used excessively. The subscriber count includes
    all types of subscribers (players, game objects, etc.) that have registered with
    the bus.
  warnings: The returned value is a snapshot at the time of calling and may not reflect
    real-time changes if other threads are modifying subscriptions concurrently. In
    multithreaded environments, consider synchronization when using this value for
    critical decisions.
