documentation:
  brief: Processes automated auction house behavior for consumable items
  description: The HandleConsumableAutomation method manages the automatic handling
    of consumable items within the auction house system. This method likely processes
    item listings, bid placements, or auction outcomes specifically for consumable
    goods such as potions, food, or other temporary-use items. It operates on a player
    reference to determine appropriate automation actions based on the player's current
    auction house activity and inventory status.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) whose
      auction house automation is being processed
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionHouse ah;

      ah.HandleConsumableAutomation(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the auction house database to update item
    statuses and player inventories. It may be called during periodic maintenance
    or when specific auction events occur. The implementation should handle edge cases
    such as invalid player IDs or empty inventories gracefully.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    dereferencing an invalid pointer could cause undefined behavior. This method may
    have performance implications if called frequently for many players simultaneously.
