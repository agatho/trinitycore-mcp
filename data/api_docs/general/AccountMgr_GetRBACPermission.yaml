documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the RBAC permission object associated with the specified permission
    ID.
  description: The GetRBACPermission method fetches a const pointer to an rbac::RBACPermission
    object based on the provided permission identifier. This method is used within
    the TrinityCore framework to access predefined role-based access control permissions.
    The returned pointer can be used to query permission details such as name, ID,
    and other metadata. It's important to note that this method does not validate
    whether the permission ID exists; it simply returns a pointer to the corresponding
    permission object if it has been loaded into memory. If the permission ID is invalid
    or not loaded, the returned pointer may be null.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an rbac::RBACPermission object corresponding to the
    given permission ID. Returns nullptr if no such permission exists or if the permission
    ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a specific RBAC permission
    code: "const rbac::RBACPermission* perm = AccountMgr::GetRBACPermission(123);\n\
      if (perm != nullptr)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Permission name: \" << perm->GetName()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that RBAC permissions are already loaded in memory. It's
    typically used during runtime when checking or applying access controls. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the permission remains loaded and should not
    be stored for extended periods.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying the returned pointer
    is not null, as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Additionally,
    if permissions are dynamically loaded or unloaded, the validity of previously
    obtained pointers cannot be guaranteed.
