  signature: void Unit::UpdateAllResistances()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all resistance values for the unit based on current stats and modifiers.
  description: The UpdateAllResistances method recalculates and applies all resistance
    values (fire, frost, shadow, nature, arcane, and holy) for a Unit object. This
    method is typically invoked when a unit's stats, buffs, debuffs, or equipment
    changes in a way that affects their magical resistances. It ensures that the unit's
    resistance values are accurately reflected in combat calculations. The method
    iterates through all applicable resistance types and recalculates each based on
    the unit's current state including base stats, temporary modifiers, and any active
    auras or effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // Some unit in the world

      target->UpdateAllResistances();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage After Stat Change
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // A player object

      player->SetModifierValue(UNIT_MOD_RESISTANCE_FIRE, 50); // Add fire resistance

      player->UpdateAllResistances(); // Recalculate all resistances'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when resistance-related
    changes occur. It's important to note that this method doesn't directly modify
    resistance values but recalculates them based on existing modifiers and stats.
    Performance-wise, this method should be used judiciously as it involves multiple
    calculations for each resistance type.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper conditions can lead
    to unnecessary performance overhead. It's generally recommended to only call this
    when actual resistance changes have occurred rather than on every update cycle.
