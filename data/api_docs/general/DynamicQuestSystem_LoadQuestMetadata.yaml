  method: LoadQuestMetadata
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::LoadQuestMetadata()
documentation:
  brief: Loads quest metadata from the database into memory for dynamic quest system
    operations.
  description: 'The LoadQuestMetadata method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with quest-related information retrieved from the game''s database.
    This method is typically invoked during server startup or when the dynamic quest
    system requires refreshed metadata. It ensures that all quest definitions, objectives,
    rewards, and dependencies are available for runtime processing. The method performs
    database queries to fetch quest templates, quest items, quest objectives, and
    related data, then caches this information in memory for efficient access during
    quest handling. Precondition: Database connection must be established and valid.
    Postcondition: Internal quest metadata structures are populated with up-to-date
    information from the database.'
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeDynamicQuestSystem()\n{\n    sDynamicQuestSystem->LoadQuestMetadata();\n\
      \    // Quest metadata is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server initialization. It may
    be re-invoked if quest data needs to be refreshed without restarting the server.
    The method performs blocking database operations, so calling it during active
    gameplay may cause temporary performance degradation. Consider using asynchronous
    loading mechanisms for production environments.
  warnings: Calling this method while quests are actively being processed by players
    may lead to inconsistent quest states. Avoid invoking this method during high-traffic
    periods or when players are actively engaged in quest progression. The method
    assumes database integrity and will not handle missing or corrupted quest data
    gracefully.
