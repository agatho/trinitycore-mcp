  signature: std::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile> BehaviorCluster::GetClusterCentroid(uint32_t
    clusterId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the centroid player profile for a specified behavior cluster.
  description: The GetClusterCentroid method returns the representative player profile
    (centroid) of a given behavior cluster. This centroid typically represents the
    average or most characteristic player in the cluster, used for AI decision-making
    and behavioral analysis within the TrinityCore framework. The method operates
    on pre-defined clusters that are generated through player behavior tracking and
    grouping algorithms. It is commonly used in NPC AI systems to determine appropriate
    responses or actions based on similar player interaction patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: A shared pointer to a PlayerProfile object representing the centroid of
    the specified cluster. Returns nullptr if the cluster ID does not exist or if
    no centroid has been computed for that cluster.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use cluster centroid
    code: "uint32_t clusterId = 42;\nstd::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile> centroid = behaviorCluster->GetClusterCentroid(clusterId);\n\
      if (centroid)\n{\n    // Use the centroid profile for AI decision making\n \
      \   std::string playerName = centroid->GetName();\n    uint32_t playerLevel\
      \ = centroid->GetLevel();\n    // ... perform AI logic based on centroid data\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that behavior clusters have already been computed and
    stored within the BehaviorCluster instance. The returned PlayerProfile may be
    a synthetic representation rather than an actual player character, especially
    in cases where the centroid is calculated from multiple players.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid cluster ID will likely return nullptr,
    so always check for null before using the returned pointer. Additionally, since
    this is a const method, it should not modify any internal state of the BehaviorCluster
    object.
