documentation:
  brief: Returns the current movement slot of the creature or player
  description: This method retrieves the currently active movement slot from the MotionMaster,
    which represents the ongoing movement state of the entity. It is commonly used
    in AI systems to determine what type of movement is currently being executed,
    such as patrol, combat, or idle movement. The returned slot provides information
    about the movement type and can be used to make decisions on how to handle the
    entity's behavior during gameplay. This method is essential for understanding
    the current state of movement within a creature's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the MovementSlot that represents the current active movement state.
    The slot contains information about the type of movement being executed, such
    as patrol, combat, or idle movement, and can be used to determine how to handle
    the entity's behavior during gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "MovementSlot currentSlot = motionMaster->GetCurrentSlot();\nif (currentSlot\
      \ == MOVEMENT_SLOT_IDLE)\n{\n    // Handle idle movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to understand the current state of an entity's movement. It should be
    used carefully as it may not always reflect the actual movement state if the entity
    is in a transitional phase.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where the entity might
    be transitioning between different movement states, as the slot returned may not
    accurately represent the current active movement.
