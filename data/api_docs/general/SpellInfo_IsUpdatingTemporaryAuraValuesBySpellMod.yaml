documentation:
  brief: Determines whether temporary aura values are updated by spell modifiers.
  description: This method checks if the spell's temporary aura values are influenced
    by spell modifiers, which affects how aura effects are calculated during spell
    processing. It is used to determine if a spell's aura modifications should be
    applied when calculating temporary effects such as damage or healing. The method
    returns true when the spell has active temporary aura modifications that affect
    its behavior, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper spell mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if temporary aura values are updated by spell modifiers, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the spell's aura effects are influenced by modifier
    calculations during spell processing.

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell modifier calculations
    and temporary aura handling. It may be called during spell processing to determine
    if aura effects should be modified by spell modifiers. Performance considerations
    include checking this flag before applying complex calculations.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it directly affects spell
    behavior. Incorrect implementation could lead to improper spell mechanics or incorrect
    damage/healing calculations.
