  signature: void CalendarInvite::SetRank(CalendarModerationRank rank)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the moderation rank of a calendar invite.
  description: The SetRank method assigns a specific moderation rank to a calendar
    invite, determining the level of permissions and privileges associated with that
    invite. This is used in the context of World of Warcraft's calendar system where
    players can be granted different ranks (such as None, Initiate, Member, Officer,
    or Owner) when invited to events or guild activities. The rank affects what actions
    the invited player can perform within the calendar context, such as accepting
    or declining invitations, managing event details, or modifying invite permissions.
    This method typically updates internal state within the CalendarInvite object
    and may trigger synchronization with the client-side UI.
  parameters:
  - name: rank
    description: The CalendarModerationRank value to assign to this calendar invite.
      Valid values include None (no privileges), Initiate (limited access), Member
      (standard access), Officer (moderate control), and Owner (full control).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a calendar invite to officer rank
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      invite->SetRank(CalendarModerationRank::OFFICER);

      // The invite now has officer-level permissions in the calendar system.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning owner rank to an event invite
    code: "CalendarInvite* eventInvite = sCalendarMgr->GetInvite(12345);\nif (eventInvite)\n\
      {\n    eventInvite->SetRank(CalendarModerationRank::OWNER);\n    // The player\
      \ now has full control over the calendar event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the calendar system when processing
    invite modifications or during event creation. It's important to note that changing
    a rank after an invite has been sent may not immediately reflect in the client
    unless proper synchronization mechanisms are used.
  warnings: Setting inappropriate ranks (e.g., OWNER for non-guild members) can lead
    to permission inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in the calendar system.
    Always validate the target user's eligibility before assigning elevated ranks.
