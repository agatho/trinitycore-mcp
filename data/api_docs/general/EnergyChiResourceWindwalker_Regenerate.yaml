  class: EnergyChiResourceWindwalker
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void EnergyChiResourceWindwalker::Regenerate(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates energy and chi resources for Windwalker monks based on elapsed
    time.
  description: The Regenerate method updates the energy and chi resource levels of
    a Windwalker monk character over time. This method is typically called during
    game ticks to simulate natural resource regeneration. It processes the time difference
    (diff) passed as an argument to determine how much energy and chi should be regenerated,
    taking into account the player's current resource levels, class-specific regeneration
    rates, and any applicable buffs or debuffs. The method ensures that resources
    do not exceed their maximum values and handles the internal state updates required
    for the Windwalker specialization's unique resource management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Regeneration
    code: 'uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second elapsed

      energyChiResource->Regenerate(diff);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer()) {\n \
      \       if (EnergyChiResourceWindwalker* energyChi = player->GetEnergyChiResource())\
      \ {\n            energyChi->Regenerate(diff);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game's main update loop at regular
    intervals. The regeneration rate may vary based on player state, such as being
    in combat or out of combat, and can be affected by talents, gear, and buffs specific
    to the Windwalker monk class.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper context; it should only
    be invoked within the game's update cycle. Improper use may lead to incorrect
    resource state management and unexpected behavior in gameplay mechanics.
