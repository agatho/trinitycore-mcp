  class: InterruptUtils
  method: GetClassInterruptSpells
  signature: int InterruptUtils::GetClassInterruptSpells(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the interrupt spells associated with a specified player class.
  description: The GetClassInterruptSpells method returns an integer identifier representing
    the set of spells that can interrupt casting for a given player class. This is
    used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine which spells are valid
    interrupt abilities based on class specialization. The returned value typically
    corresponds to a predefined bitmask or lookup index that maps to specific spell
    IDs in the game's spell database. This method is essential for handling spell
    interruption mechanics during combat, particularly when one player interrupts
    another's casting.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The class identifier of the player (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE).
      Must be a valid class enum value from the TrinityCore class definitions.
  returns: An integer representing the interrupt spell set for the specified class.
    The exact meaning depends on internal implementation but typically corresponds
    to a lookup table index or bitmask indicating which spells are classified as interrupt
    abilities for that class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint8 playerClass = CLASS_MAGE;

      int interruptSpells = InterruptUtils::GetClassInterruptSpells(playerClass);

      // Returns the interrupt spell identifier for Mages'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Interrupt Check
    code: "void HandleSpellInterrupt(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    uint8 casterClass\
      \ = caster->getClass();\n    int interruptSet = InterruptUtils::GetClassInterruptSpells(casterClass);\n\
      \    if (interruptSet > 0) {\n        // Proceed with interrupt logic using\
      \ the returned spell set\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal class-to-spell mappings defined in
    TrinityCore's spell or class system. It is assumed to be a lookup function and
    should not perform heavy computations. The return value may be used as an index
    into a static array or map of interrupt spells.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerClass parameter is validated before calling this
    method, as invalid class values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    spell mappings. This method should only be called with valid class identifiers
    from the TrinityCore engine.
