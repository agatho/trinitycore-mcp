  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: RestockReagents
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::RestockReagents(Creature * vendor)
documentation:
  brief: Restocks a vendor's reagent inventory to full capacity.
  description: The RestockReagents method ensures that a given vendor creature has
    its reagent inventory fully replenished. This function is typically invoked when
    a vendor's reagent stock needs to be refreshed, such as during periodic resets
    or after a player purchases items that require reagents. It iterates through the
    vendor's reagent list and restores each item to its maximum stack size. The method
    returns true if the restock operation was successful, and false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring that vendors
    can consistently provide reagents for crafting.
  parameters:
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor whose reagent
      inventory will be restocked. Must not be null.
  returns: True if the reagent inventory was successfully restocked, false if the
    operation failed or the vendor is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (NPCInteractionManager::RestockReagents(vendorCreature)) {\n    // Reagents\
      \ have been restocked\n    sLog->outString(\"Vendor reagents restocked successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to restock\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to restock\
      \ vendor reagents.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the vendor creature has a valid reagent inventory
    set up. It does not handle cases where reagents are not defined for the vendor
    or when there are issues with item templates. Performance-wise, this operation
    may be costly if vendors have many reagent entries, as it involves multiple database
    lookups and inventory updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the vendor pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid crashes. The method does not perform any checks for player interaction or
    cooldowns; it simply restocks the inventory regardless of recent transactions.
