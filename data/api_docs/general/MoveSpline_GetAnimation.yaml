  signature: int MoveSpline::GetAnimation() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the animation phase identifier associated with the movement spline.
  description: The GetAnimation method returns an integer value representing the current
    animation phase of the movement spline. This phase typically corresponds to a
    specific animation state or sequence that is being played during the object's
    movement, such as walking, running, jumping, or falling. The returned value can
    be used by the game engine to synchronize visual animations with movement behavior
    and determine appropriate actions based on the current motion state. This method
    is commonly used in character movement systems where precise control over animation
    states is required for realistic gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the animation phase identifier. The specific values
    are determined by the internal animation system and may vary depending on the
    object type (player, creature, etc.) and current movement state. Typical values
    might include constants like 0 for idle, 1 for walking, 2 for running, or other
    phase-specific identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Movement Animation
    code: "void CheckPlayerMovementAnimation(Player* player)\n{\n    MoveSpline const&\
      \ spline = player->movespline;\n    int animationPhase = spline.GetAnimation();\n\
      \    \n    if (animationPhase == 1)\n        sLog->outString(\"Player is currently\
      \ walking.\");\n    else if (animationPhase == 2)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player is currently running.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides read-only access to the animation phase and does not
    modify any internal state. The returned value should be interpreted according
    to the game's internal animation system definitions. Developers should be aware
    that animation phases might differ between different object types (players vs.
    creatures) and may change dynamically during movement.
  warnings: The exact meaning of animation phase values is implementation-dependent
    and may not be fully documented in public APIs. Relying on specific numeric values
    for animation states can lead to compatibility issues if the internal system changes.
    Always verify that returned values are within expected ranges before using them
    in conditional logic.
