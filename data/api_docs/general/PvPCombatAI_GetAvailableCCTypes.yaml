  method: GetAvailableCCTypes
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetAvailableCCTypes(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the available crowd control types that can be applied by this PvP
    combat AI.
  description: The GetAvailableCCTypes method returns an integer value representing
    the bitmask of all currently available crowd control (CC) types that the PvPCombatAI
    instance can apply to target players. This method is typically used in PvP scenarios
    where NPCs or AI-controlled entities need to determine which CC effects they are
    capable of applying. The returned value represents a combination of CC type flags,
    allowing the caller to check for specific CC capabilities using bitwise operations.
    The parameter 'player' is expected to point to a valid player object, though its
    exact usage within this method's implementation cannot be determined without source
    code access.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to a player object that the AI will evaluate for CC applicability.
      Must be a valid pointer to an existing Player instance.
  returns: An integer bitmask representing available crowd control types. Each bit
    corresponds to a specific CC type, allowing bitwise checks to determine which
    effects are supported by this AI instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for available CC types
    code: "Player* target = ...; // some player object\nint ccTypes = ai->GetAvailableCCTypes(target);\n\
      if (ccTypes & CC_TYPE_ROOT)\n{\n    // AI can apply root effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple CC types using bitwise operations
    code: "Player* target = ...;\nint ccTypes = ai->GetAvailableCCTypes(target);\n\
      \nif (ccTypes & (CC_TYPE_STUN | CC_TYPE_ROOT))\n{\n    // AI can apply either\
      \ stun or root\n}\n\n// Check if specific CC is available\nbool canApplySilence\
      \ = (ccTypes & CC_TYPE_SILENCE) != 0;\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal AI state and player status to
    determine which CC effects are currently valid. The exact CC type constants (e.g.,
    CC_TYPE_STUN, CC_TYPE_ROOT) should be defined in the TrinityCore headers or documentation.
    This function may be called frequently during combat, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account for high-frequency PvP scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null to prevent
    undefined behavior. The bitmask interpretation depends on predefined CC type constants
    which may vary between different versions of TrinityCore or custom modifications.
