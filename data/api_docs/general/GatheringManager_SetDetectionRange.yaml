  class: GatheringManager
  method: SetDetectionRange
  signature: void GatheringManager::SetDetectionRange(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the detection range for gathering activities within the GatheringManager.
  description: The SetDetectionRange method configures the maximum distance at which
    gathering operations (such as mining, herbalism, or skinning) can be detected
    by players. This value determines how far a player's character must be from a
    resource node to initiate gathering actions. The range is typically defined in
    yards and affects the gameplay mechanics of resource collection in World of Warcraft
    environments. This method does not validate the input range, so developers should
    ensure that the provided value is within reasonable bounds for game balance.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The detection range in yards. This determines how far a player can
      detect and interact with gathering nodes. Values should typically be positive
      floats representing distance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Detection Range to 10 Yards
    code: 'GatheringManager* manager = ...;

      manager->SetDetectionRange(10.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Detection Range Based on Player Class
    code: "GatheringManager* manager = ...;\nif (player->getClass() == CLASS_ROGUE)\n\
      \    manager->SetDetectionRange(15.0f);\nelse\n    manager->SetDetectionRange(8.0f);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal detection range used by gathering
    systems. It is recommended to call this during initialization or configuration
    phases rather than dynamically during gameplay to avoid unexpected behavior. The
    range value may influence performance if set too high, as more nodes will be considered
    for detection.
  warnings: Setting an extremely large detection range can cause performance degradation
    due to increased node detection calculations. Avoid setting negative values as
    they are not validated and may lead to undefined behavior.
