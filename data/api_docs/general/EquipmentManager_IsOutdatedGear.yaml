  class: EquipmentManager
  method: IsOutdatedGear
  signature: bool EquipmentManager::IsOutdatedGear(int * player, int * item)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player's equipment is outdated compared to current game
    standards.
  description: The IsOutdatedGear method evaluates if a player's currently equipped
    items are below the recommended quality or level thresholds for their character's
    current progression stage. This function typically compares item levels, quality
    ratings, and other relevant attributes against established guidelines within the
    TrinityCore framework. It is commonly used in automated systems that recommend
    gear upgrades or in achievement tracking mechanisms. The method may consider factors
    such as player level, specialization, and current expansion content to make its
    determination.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object whose equipment is being evaluated for
      outdated status.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the item object that is being checked against current
      gear standards.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is considered outdated based on current
    game progression standards; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = player->GetItemByPos(...);\nbool isOutdated\
      \ = EquipmentManager::IsOutdatedGear(&player, &item);\nif (isOutdated) {\n \
      \   // Handle outdated gear logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal caching or state tracking to optimize
    performance during frequent checks. It may be influenced by expansion-specific
    rules and should be called with valid pointers to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item parameters are valid and not null before
    calling this method, as invalid pointers can lead to crashes or unpredictable
    results.
