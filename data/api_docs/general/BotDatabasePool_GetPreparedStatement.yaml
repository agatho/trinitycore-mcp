  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: GetPreparedStatement
  signature: int * BotDatabasePool::GetPreparedStatement(uint32 stmtId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a prepared SQL statement from the bot database pool by its unique
    identifier.
  description: The GetPreparedStatement method fetches a precompiled SQL statement
    from the BotDatabasePool based on the provided statement ID. This method is used
    to obtain prepared statements that can be executed efficiently against the database.
    The returned pointer typically points to a prepared statement object that can
    be used for multiple executions with different parameters. In the context of TrinityCore's
    bot system, this allows for optimized database interactions when managing bot
    data such as behavior patterns, inventory, or player relationships.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the prepared statement handle. This
    value should be used in subsequent database operations to execute the prepared
    statement. Returns NULL if the statement ID is invalid or if the preparation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of GetPreparedStatement
    code: "int* stmt = botDatabasePool->GetPreparedStatement(BOT_STMT_SELECT_BOT_DATA);\n\
      if (stmt != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the prepared statement for database operations\n\
      \    // Example: WorldDatabase.PExecute(\"SELECT * FROM bot_data WHERE id =\
      \ %u\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with database transaction management.
    Prepared statements are cached and reused to improve performance. The statement
    ID should correspond to a valid prepared statement defined in the database pool
    configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the statement ID passed to this method is valid, as invalid
    IDs may cause NULL returns or undefined behavior. Always check for null return
    values before using the returned pointer.
