api:
  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: GetSession
  signature: WorldSession * GroupInvitationHandler::GetSession() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the WorldSession associated with the group invitation handler.
  description: The GetSession method returns a pointer to the WorldSession object
    that is currently associated with this GroupInvitationHandler instance. This session
    represents the client connection of the player who initiated or is involved in
    the group invitation process. The method provides access to session-specific data
    such as player information, network connection details, and authentication state.
    In the context of TrinityCore's group management system, this allows the handler
    to interact with the player's session for sending responses, managing invitations,
    and handling group-related communications.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the WorldSession object associated with the group invitation
    handler, or nullptr if no session is currently bound.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Player Session in Group Invitation Handler
    code: "void HandleGroupInviteResponse(GroupInvitationHandler* handler)\n{\n  \
      \  WorldSession* session = handler->GetSession();\n    if (session && session->GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        // Access player information from the session\n        Player*\
      \ player = session->GetPlayer();\n        sLog->outString(\"Player %s is handling\
      \ group invitation.\", player->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of group invitation processing
    where access to the player's session is required for communication or validation
    purposes. The returned session pointer should be checked for null before use to
    avoid potential crashes.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupInvitationHandler instance has an active session
    bound before calling GetSession, as returning a null pointer may indicate an invalid
    state in the invitation handling process.
