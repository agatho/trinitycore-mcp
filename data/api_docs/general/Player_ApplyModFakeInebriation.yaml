  description: This method modifies the player's fake intoxication state by applying
    or removing a specified mod value. It is used primarily for managing the player's
    fake drunkenness effect, which can influence various game mechanics such as movement
    speed, combat abilities, and stat modifiers. The method allows for precise control
    over the intensity of the fake intoxication effect, making it useful for both
    gameplay and debugging purposes.

      values increase intoxication, while negative values decrease it.

  - title: Advanced usage example

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other intoxication-related
    functions. It should be called carefully as it can affect player behavior and
    game balance. The method does not directly affect real intoxication but rather
    simulates the effect for gameplay purposes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior or game imbalance.
    It should only be used in controlled environments such as debugging or testing
    scenarios.
