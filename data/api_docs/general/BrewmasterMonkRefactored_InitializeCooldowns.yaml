  brief: Initializes cooldowns for Brewmaster Monk abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for the Brewmaster Monk class. This method is typically called during character
    initialization or when a new instance of the BrewmasterMonkRefactored class is
    created. It ensures that all monk abilities start with their correct default cooldown
    values, preventing any unexpected behavior during gameplay. The method handles
    internal state management for cooldown tracking and prepares the class for proper
    ability usage.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'BrewmasterMonkRefactored monk;

      monk.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during object initialization. Repeated
    calls may reset cooldown states unexpectedly. The implementation assumes that
    the class has been properly constructed with necessary internal data structures
    for tracking cooldowns.
