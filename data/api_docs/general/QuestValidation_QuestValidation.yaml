documentation:
  brief: Initializes the QuestValidation class for checking quest-related conditions
    and requirements.
  description: The QuestValidation constructor initializes internal data structures
    and prepares the class for performing quest validation checks. This method sets
    up necessary state tracking for quest-related operations, including loading required
    configuration settings, initializing caches for quest data, and preparing validation
    rules. The initialization process ensures that subsequent quest validation calls
    can efficiently verify player progress, quest completion status, and prerequisite
    fulfillment without redundant setup overhead. This constructor is typically called
    during server startup or when a new quest validation context needs to be established.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic QuestValidation Initialization
    code: 'QuestValidation validator;

      // The validator is now ready to perform quest validations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs initialization tasks that may involve database
    queries or configuration loading. It should only be called once per instance,
    as multiple invocations could lead to resource leaks or inconsistent state. The
    class assumes proper server context is available when this constructor is called.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly in performance-critical code paths
    as it may perform blocking operations during initialization. Ensure that QuestValidation
    instances are properly managed and destroyed to prevent memory leaks.
