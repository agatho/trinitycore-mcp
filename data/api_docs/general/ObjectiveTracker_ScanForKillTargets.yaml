  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ScanForKillTargets
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::ScanForKillTargets(Player * bot, uint32 creatureId,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Scans for kill targets within a specified radius for the given creature ID.
  description: The ScanForKillTargets method is used to identify and count eligible
    creatures within a defined radius that match a specific creature ID. This functionality
    is typically employed in objective tracking systems, such as quest progression
    or AI behavior logic, where the player's actions (like killing creatures) need
    to be monitored and recorded. The method performs a search across the game world
    for creatures matching the specified criteria, returning a count of how many were
    found. It is commonly used by bot systems or automated quest completion mechanisms
    to determine if objectives have been met.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player performing
      the scan.
  - name: creatureId
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature type to search for.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance in yards from the bot's current position to
      scan for matching creatures.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of creatures matching the specified
    creature ID found within the given radius. A return value of zero indicates no
    matching creatures were found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int count = objectiveTracker->ScanForKillTargets(playerBot, 12345, 10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to update quest progress
    code: "int targetCount = objectiveTracker->ScanForKillTargets(bot, 12345, 25.0f);\n\
      if (targetCount >= 5) {\n    // Update quest objective\n    bot->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID)->SetCount(5);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a world search and may have performance implications
    if used excessively or with large radii. It is recommended to limit the scan radius
    to reasonable values for optimal performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the creatureId parameter corresponds to a valid creature entry
    in the database, otherwise the method will return zero matches. Also, be cautious
    when using this method in high-frequency loops as it can impact server performance.
