  method: Clear
  signature: void UpdateTimeHistogram::Clear()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all recorded update time measurements from the histogram.
  description: The Clear method resets the UpdateTimeHistogram by removing all previously
    recorded update time measurements. This method is typically used to reset statistics
    tracking for performance monitoring or debugging purposes. The histogram will
    be empty after calling this method, and any subsequent calls to record new measurements
    will start a fresh collection. This operation is thread-safe and does not affect
    other histogram instances.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Clear Usage
    code: 'UpdateTimeHistogram histogram;

      histogram.Record(100);

      histogram.Record(200);

      histogram.Clear(); // Histogram is now empty'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of the histogram's internal data structure.
    It should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as it may involve
    memory management operations. The method does not allocate new memory but rather
    resets existing storage.
