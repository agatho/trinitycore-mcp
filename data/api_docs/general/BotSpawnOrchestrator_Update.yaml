  class: BotSpawnOrchestrator
  method: Update
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot spawn orchestrator state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing and processing the spawning
    and despawning of bots within the game world. It handles the timing logic for
    when new bots should be created or existing ones removed, ensuring that bot populations
    remain within configured limits. This method is typically called from the main
    game loop at regular intervals, using the provided time delta to determine if
    any spawn or despawn operations should occur. The method may also handle cleanup
    of inactive bots and synchronization of bot states with the overall world state.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    botSpawnOrchestrator.Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop with accurate
    time deltas to ensure proper bot spawning behavior. The implementation likely
    uses internal timers and counters to determine when to spawn or despawn bots.
