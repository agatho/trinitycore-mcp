  method: ~PolicyNetwork
  signature: void PolicyNetwork::~PolicyNetwork()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PolicyNetwork instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PolicyNetwork class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the PolicyNetwork object.
    This method is automatically invoked when a PolicyNetwork object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's networking and AI systems,
    this destructor ensures proper cleanup of policy-related data structures that
    may have been initialized during the object's lifetime. It typically handles release
    of internal buffers, termination of network connections, or deallocation of policy
    configuration data. The method does not accept any parameters and performs no
    return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PolicyNetwork object
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PolicyNetwork network;\n    // ... use network\
      \ ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of PolicyNetwork pointer
    code: 'PolicyNetwork* network = new PolicyNetwork();

      // ... use network ...

      delete network; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of resource management in TrinityCore's
    networking subsystem. It should be called only once per object instance and must
    not be invoked on already-destroyed objects. Developers should ensure that no
    other code holds references to the object after calling delete or when it goes
    out of scope.
  warnings: Calling the destructor directly (e.g., network->~PolicyNetwork()) is dangerous
    and can lead to undefined behavior. Always use proper deletion mechanisms like
    'delete' for heap-allocated objects or let stack objects be destroyed naturally.
    Avoid double-destruction of the same object instance.
