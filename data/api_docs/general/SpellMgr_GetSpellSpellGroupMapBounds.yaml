documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell group map bounds for a specified spell ID
  description: This method returns the SpellSpellGroupMapBounds structure which contains
    the lower and upper bounds of a spell's entry in the spell spell group map. The
    spell spell group map is used internally by TrinityCore to manage relationships
    between spells and their associated groups, such as spell families or categories.
    This allows for efficient lookup and management of spell group memberships without
    requiring full table scans. The returned bounds can be used with standard STL
    container iteration techniques to access all spell group entries associated with
    a particular spell ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellSpellGroupMapBounds object containing the lower and upper bounds
    (as iterators) for the specified spell ID in the internal spell spell group map.
    These bounds define the range of elements in the map that correspond to the given
    spell ID, enabling efficient range-based iteration over related spell entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpellMgr* spellMgr = sSpellMgr;\nuint32 spellId = 12345;\nSpellSpellGroupMapBounds\
      \ bounds = spellMgr->GetSpellSpellGroupMapBounds(spellId);\nfor (auto itr =\
      \ bounds.first; itr != bounds.second; ++itr)\n{\n    // Process each spell group\
      \ entry for the given spell ID\n    uint32 groupId = itr->second;\n    // Do\
      \ something with the group ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the core for spell group processing
    and spell family handling. The returned bounds are designed to work with standard
    STL container iteration patterns. This method does not perform any validation
    on the input spell_id, so calling it with an invalid ID may return empty bounds
    or undefined behavior.
  warnings: This method should only be called from within the context of spell processing
    or when the spell manager is properly initialized. Using this method without proper
    initialization can lead to undefined behavior. The returned bounds are only valid
    until the underlying map structure changes, so avoid storing them for extended
    periods.
