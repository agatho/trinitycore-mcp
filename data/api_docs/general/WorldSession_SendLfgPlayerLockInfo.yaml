documentation:
  brief: Sends LFG player lock information to the client
  description: This method sends a packet to the connected client containing information
    about the player's current LFG (Looking for Group) lock status. It is used by
    the TrinityCore server to communicate with the World of Warcraft client about
    whether the player is currently locked into an LFG activity, preventing them from
    joining other groups or queues. The packet includes details such as the lock status,
    reason for locking, and any associated group IDs or queue information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a player login context
    code: "void PlayerLoginHandler(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    // Send LFG lock\
      \ info when player logs in\n    session->SendLfgPlayerLockInfo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login, when entering/leaving
    LFG queues, or when changing group states. The client uses this information to
    update the user interface and prevent invalid actions such as joining multiple
    groups simultaneously.
