documentation:
  brief: Sets the talent reset cost for the player.
  description: This method allows setting the cost associated with resetting talents
    for a player character. The talent reset cost represents the amount of gold required
    to reset talent points, which is typically used in conjunction with the SetTalentResetCost
    function to modify the cost of talent resets. This method is commonly used in
    custom scripts or game master commands to adjust the gold cost of talent resets.
    It affects the player's ability to reset their talents and can be used to implement
    various game mechanics such as custom talent reset costs or to control the gold
    requirements for resetting talents.
  parameters:
  - name: cost
    description: The new talent reset cost in copper (gold). This value represents
      the amount of gold required to reset talent points, typically expressed in copper
      units. Valid values are usually between 0 and 100000000 (100 million copper).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Talent Reset Cost
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetTalentResetCost(1000000); // Set reset cost to 100 gold'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other talent-related functions.
    The cost value should be carefully managed to ensure proper game balance. This
    function does not directly affect the player's talent points but rather modifies
    the cost required to reset them.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay or incorrect
    gold costs for talent resets. Care should be taken when setting values to ensure
    they align with game design requirements.
