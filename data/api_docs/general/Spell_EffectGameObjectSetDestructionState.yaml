  method: EffectGameObjectSetDestructionState
  signature: void Spell::EffectGameObjectSetDestructionState()
documentation:
  brief: Sets the destruction state of a game object affected by this spell.
  description: This method is used to control the destruction state of game objects
    that are targeted by the spell. It typically applies to GameObjects such as doors,
    gates, or other interactive objects that can be destroyed or reactivated based
    on the spell's effect. The method modifies the GameObject's state without requiring
    explicit parameters, relying instead on the spell's context and target information.
    This is commonly used in scenarios where a spell needs to destroy or modify a
    game object's state during gameplay.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectGameObjectSetDestructionState()\n{\n    // Implementation\
      \ details\n}\n\n// In a spell handler, this would be called when the spell affects\
      \ a GameObject\n// Example: spell with effect 10 (game object destruction)\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell effects that target game objects.
    It requires proper context and target information to function correctly. The implementation
    involves modifying the GameObject's state directly based on the spell's effect.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the spell has a valid target GameObject.
    Improper usage may result in undefined behavior or errors during gameplay.
