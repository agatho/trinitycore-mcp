  class: SupportMgr
  method: Initialize
  signature: void SupportMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the SupportMgr singleton instance and prepares it for use.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the SupportMgr class by performing necessary
    setup operations such as initializing internal data structures, registering event
    handlers, or loading required configuration settings. This method is typically
    called during server startup to ensure that the support manager is fully functional
    before any game events occur. It ensures thread safety and proper initialization
    sequence for all dependent systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: SupportMgr::Instance()->Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's lifecycle. Reinitialization
    may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is designed to be
    thread-safe and does not block execution for extended periods.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times without proper cleanup can cause memory
    corruption or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that all subsystems depending
    on SupportMgr are ready before calling this method.
