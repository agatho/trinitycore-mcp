  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: GetResourceCost
  signature: uint32 SurvivalHunterRefactored::GetResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the resource cost of a specified spell for the survival
    hunter class.
  description: The GetResourceCost method retrieves the resource cost associated with
    a given spell ID for the Survival Hunter class. This method is typically used
    during spell casting validation to determine if the player has sufficient resources
    (such as focus, energy, or rage) to cast the specified ability. The returned value
    represents the amount of resource required to execute the spell, which may vary
    based on spell properties, player level, and class-specific modifiers. This function
    is essential for maintaining game balance and ensuring proper resource management
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which to calculate the resource
      cost. This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell
      database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the resource cost required to cast
    the specified spell. A return value of zero typically indicates that the spell
    does not consume any resources or that the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 cost = hunter->GetResourceCost(19574); // Calculate cost for Serpent\
      \ Sting\nif (cost > 0) {\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Validation Example
    code: "uint32 spellId = 77767; // Steady Shot\nuint32 requiredCost = hunter->GetResourceCost(spellId);\n\
      if (hunter->GetPower(POWER_FOCUS) >= requiredCost) {\n    // Player can cast\
      \ the spell\n    hunter->ModifyPower(POWER_FOCUS, -static_cast<int32>(requiredCost));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data structures and may cache results
    for performance. Developers should be aware that resource costs can be modified
    by buffs, debuffs, or class talents. The implementation assumes valid spell IDs
    and does not perform explicit validation of the input parameter.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spellId may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect cost calculations. Always validate spell IDs before calling this
    function if working with dynamic spell data. Be cautious when using this method
    in performance-critical sections as it may involve database lookups or complex
    calculations.
