  class: TargetScanner
  method: GetThreatValue
  signature: float TargetScanner::GetThreatValue(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the threat value associated with a specified target unit.
  description: The GetThreatValue method returns a float representing the current
    threat level that the TargetScanner has toward a given Unit target. This value
    is typically used in AI decision-making processes to determine which target to
    prioritize for attacks or other actions. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is generally called during threat evaluation phases of NPC behavior
    logic. It's important to note that this method may return zero or negative values
    depending on the current threat calculation logic, indicating low or no threat
    respectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the threat level towards the target unit. Higher
    values indicate higher threat, while zero or negative values suggest minimal or
    no threat. The exact scale and interpretation depend on the internal threat system
    implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Value Retrieval
    code: "float threat = scanner.GetThreatValue(targetUnit);\nif (threat > 100.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Target is highly threatening\n    DoAggressiveAction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Threat Values
    code: "Unit* target1 = GetTarget1();\nUnit* target2 = GetTarget2();\nfloat threat1\
      \ = scanner.GetThreatValue(target1);\nfloat threat2 = scanner.GetThreatValue(target2);\n\
      \nif (threat1 > threat2)\n{\n    // Prioritize target1\n    SetCurrentTarget(target1);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Prioritize target2\n    SetCurrentTarget(target2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TargetScanner's core functionality and should
    be used within the context of AI decision-making loops. It's recommended to cache
    threat values when performing multiple comparisons to avoid redundant calculations.
    The method assumes that the target unit is valid and has been processed by the
    scanner's threat system.
  warnings: Calling this method on a Unit that hasn't been evaluated for threat by
    the TargetScanner may result in undefined behavior or incorrect values. Always
    ensure proper initialization of the scanner and target evaluation before calling
    this method.
