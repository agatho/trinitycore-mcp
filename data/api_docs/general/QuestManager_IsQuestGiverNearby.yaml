documentation:
  brief: Checks if a quest giver is within interaction distance of the player
  description: Determines whether there is a valid quest giver object within the player's
    current interaction range. This method evaluates the proximity of nearby NPCs
    or objects that can provide quests to the calling player. It typically checks
    against the player's current map and surrounding area for eligible quest givers,
    considering both visual and functional distance thresholds. The result is used
    by the game client and server logic to enable or disable quest-related UI elements
    and interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid quest giver is within interaction distance; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the player can currently interact with a
    quest provider.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Giver Check
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager()->IsQuestGiverNearby()) {\n    // Enable quest\
      \ interaction UI\n    player->SendQuestGiverStatus();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Interaction Logic
    code: "QuestManager* qm = player->GetQuestManager();\nif (qm->IsQuestGiverNearby())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with quest dialog\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->ClearMenus();\n\
      \    qm->SendQuestGiverHello();\n} else {\n    // Notify player that no quest\
      \ givers are nearby\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"No quest givers are nearby.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest giver tracking system and may cache
    results for performance. It typically checks against the player's current map
    and surrounding area, considering both visual range and functional interaction
    distance. The implementation uses standard TrinityCore proximity detection logic.
  warnings: This method does not account for quest-specific restrictions or availability
    conditions beyond simple proximity. It only verifies physical distance and presence
    of a valid quest giver object in the immediate vicinity.
