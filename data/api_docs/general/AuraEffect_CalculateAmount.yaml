  class: AuraEffect
  method: CalculateAmount
  signature: int32 AuraEffect::CalculateAmount(Unit * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effective amount of an aura effect based on the
    caster's influence.
  description: The CalculateAmount method determines the actual numerical value of
    an aura effect, taking into account various factors such as the caster's level,
    stats, and any applicable modifiers. This method is crucial for dynamic aura calculations
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine, ensuring that effects like damage over
    time, healing, or stat bonuses are properly scaled. It typically involves complex
    computations based on the aura's type, the caster's properties, and potential
    randomization or scaling factors. The result is used to apply the calculated effect
    to the target unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the computed amount of the aura effect. This
    value can be positive or negative depending on whether the effect is beneficial
    or harmful, and may vary based on caster attributes and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: 'AuraEffect* aura = ...;

      Unit* caster = player;

      int32 amount = aura->CalculateAmount(caster);

      // Use ''amount'' to apply the calculated effect to a target'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Calculated Amount for Damage Application
    code: "AuraEffect* aura = unit->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE, 0);\n\
      if (aura)\n{\n    int32 damage = aura->CalculateAmount(caster);\n    // Apply\
      \ damage using the calculated amount\n    unit->DealDamage(caster, damage, nullptr,\
      \ DOT, SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during aura application or update cycles.
    It may involve random number generation for effects like periodic damage or healing,
    and can be influenced by spell modifiers, buffs, debuffs, and class-specific scaling
    factors. The calculation may also depend on the target's resistance or mitigation
    values in some cases.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without ensuring that the aura is properly
    initialized and that the caster unit is valid. Incorrect usage may lead to invalid
    calculations or crashes if the aura effect type is not supported or the caster
    is null.
