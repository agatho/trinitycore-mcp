  brief: Removes a ticket entry from the database
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes the current ticket instance from the
    database storage. This method is typically called when a ticket has been resolved
    or closed and should no longer be persisted in the database. The operation directly
    affects the underlying database record associated with this ticket object, ensuring
    that subsequent queries will not return this ticket unless it is recreated. This
    method does not invalidate the ticket object in memory; it only removes the database
    entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deleting a resolved ticket
    code: "Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketById(12345);\nif (ticket)\n{\n  \
      \  ticket->DeleteFromDB();\n    sTicketMgr->RemoveTicket(ticket);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database DELETE operation and should only be
    called after ensuring that the ticket is no longer needed. The method assumes
    that the ticket has been properly initialized with valid database identifiers.
    It's recommended to call this method before destroying or removing the ticket
    object from memory to prevent orphaned records.
  warnings: Calling DeleteFromDB on a ticket that hasn't been saved to the database
    yet will result in no-op behavior. Always verify that the ticket exists in the
    database before deletion to avoid unnecessary operations.
