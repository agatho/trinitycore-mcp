  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: MonitorGroupSafety
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::MonitorGroupSafety(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Monitors the safety status of players within a group instance and triggers
    appropriate actions based on group composition and instance requirements.
  description: The MonitorGroupSafety method evaluates the current state of a specified
    group within an instance environment to ensure that all players meet the necessary
    conditions for safe progression or interaction. It checks for player health, presence
    of required items, and other instance-specific safety criteria. This method is
    typically invoked during instance entry, player movement, or periodic updates
    to maintain game balance and prevent unintended behavior such as players entering
    dangerous areas without proper preparation. The function does not directly modify
    group state but may trigger events or actions that affect the group's progression
    through the instance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose safety status
      is being monitored. Must be a valid pointer to an existing group, otherwise
      behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance entry handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterInstance(Player* player, InstanceMap* map)\n{\n    if\
      \ (Group* group = player->GetGroup())\n    {\n        sInstanceCoordination->MonitorGroupSafety(group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance coordination system and may be called
    frequently during gameplay. It's designed to be lightweight but can potentially
    trigger additional checks or events depending on instance type and group composition.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this function is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. The method
    assumes the group has already been validated for instance membership before calling.
