documentation:
  brief: Summon a pet for the player using specified entry and slot
  description: The SummonPet method allows a player to summon a pet by specifying
    the creature entry ID, slot number, and position coordinates. This method creates
    a new pet instance based on the provided parameters and returns a pointer to that
    pet. The pet will be summoned at the specified location with the given orientation,
    and can optionally be set to despawn after a specified time. This functionality
    is commonly used in player-controlled pet summoning mechanics within World of
    Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID of the pet to summon. This determines what
      type of pet will be summoned.
  - name: slot
    description: The slot number where the pet should be summoned. Valid values are
      typically 0-4, representing different pet slots.
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate position where the pet will be summoned.
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate position where the pet will be summoned.
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate position where the pet will be summoned.
  - name: ang
    description: Orientation angle in radians for the pet's facing direction.
  - name: despwtime
    description: Despawn time in milliseconds for the pet. If set to 0, the pet will
      not despawn automatically.
  - name: isNew
    description: Pointer to boolean indicating whether this is a new pet or an existing
      one. This parameter is optional and may be NULL.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Pet object that was summoned. If the summon fails,
    it returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic pet summoning example
    code: Pet* pet = player->SummonPet(12345, 0, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced pet summoning with despawn time
    code: Pet* pet = player->SummonPet(12345, 1, 10.0f, 10.0f, 0.0f, M_PI_2, 60000,
      &isNew);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method handles pet summoning logic internally and may involve multiple
    steps including creating the pet object, setting its position, orientation, and
    despawn time. It should be used carefully as it can affect player's pet management
    and game balance.
  warnings: This method may fail if invalid entry IDs or slot numbers are provided.
    Care must be taken to ensure proper coordinates and orientation values are passed
    to avoid incorrect pet positioning.
