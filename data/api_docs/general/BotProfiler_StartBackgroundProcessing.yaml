  class: BotProfiler
  method: StartBackgroundProcessing
  signature: void BotProfiler::StartBackgroundProcessing()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates background processing for bot profiling tasks in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The StartBackgroundProcessing method initializes and begins asynchronous
    profiling operations for bot behavior within the TrinityCore game server. This
    method typically sets up internal threads or timers to monitor and collect data
    about AI decision-making, resource usage, and performance metrics of scripted
    bots. It is designed to run without blocking the main game loop, allowing continuous
    monitoring while maintaining server responsiveness. The method may configure profiling
    intervals, allocate necessary resources, and start data collection processes that
    are essential for analyzing bot performance and behavior patterns.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.StartBackgroundProcessing();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after initializing the BotProfiler instance
    but before any bot activity begins. The background processing may spawn separate
    threads, so ensure proper synchronization if accessing shared data structures.
    Profiling data is typically stored internally and can be retrieved via other methods
    in the class.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without stopping previous processes
    may lead to resource leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that all profiling tasks
    are properly stopped before shutting down the profiler or server.
