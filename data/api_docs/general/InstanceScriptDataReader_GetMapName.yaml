  class: InstanceScriptDataReader
  method: GetMapName
  signature: const char * InstanceScriptDataReader::GetMapName() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of the map associated with the instance script data reader.
  description: The GetMapName method returns a constant character pointer to the name
    of the map that the InstanceScriptDataReader is currently associated with. This
    method is typically used within TrinityCore's instance scripting system to access
    metadata about the current map context, such as for logging, debugging, or conditional
    logic based on the map being processed. The returned string is managed internally
    by the system and should not be modified or freed by the caller. This method does
    not require any parameters and is safe to call from within instance script contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const char pointer to the null-terminated string representing the map
    name. Returns nullptr if no valid map context exists or if the reader has not
    been properly initialized with a map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in instance script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        const char* mapName = GetMapName();\n   \
      \     if (mapName)\n        {\n            sLog->outString(\"Player entered\
      \ map: %s\", mapName);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string pointer is valid only for the lifetime of the InstanceScriptDataReader
    object and should not be stored or used after the reader is destroyed. This method
    is part of the instance script context and assumes that the reader has been properly
    initialized with a valid map reference.
