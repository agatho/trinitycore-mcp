  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for Marksmanship Hunter abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the internal cooldown tracking
    system for a Marksmanship Hunter class instance. This method is typically called
    during player initialization or when switching to the Marksmanship specialization.
    It establishes baseline cooldown states for all relevant hunter abilities, ensuring
    proper cooldown management and ability usage mechanics within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method prepares the hunter's cooldown timers and ensures that subsequent
    ability casting respects the game's cooldown rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the hunter's initialization
    phase. It is typically invoked automatically by the core game system when a player
    selects the Marksmanship specialization or when a new hunter instance is created.
