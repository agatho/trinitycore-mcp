documentation:
  brief: Returns the interaction range for a specified game object based on its type
    and configuration.
  description: The GetInteractionRange method calculates and returns the maximum distance
    at which a player can interact with a given GameObject. This value is typically
    derived from the game object's template data, such as its interaction range setting
    or type-specific defaults. The returned float value represents the radius in yards
    within which players can perform actions like opening containers, using quest
    objects, or interacting with NPCs through game mechanics. This method does not
    consider dynamic factors like player state or temporary modifiers, and is primarily
    used by the core interaction system to validate proximity before allowing interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the interaction range in yards. This value defines
    how close a player must be to the GameObject to initiate an interaction. A negative
    or zero value typically indicates that no interaction is possible or the object
    has invalid configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Interaction Distance
    code: "GameObject* go = ...; // Assume initialized GameObject\nfloat range = sInteractionManager->GetInteractionRange(go);\n\
      if (range > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Player can interact with the object within 'range'\
      \ yards\n    printf(\"Interaction range: %.2f yards\\n\", range);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on GameObject template data and does not account for runtime
    modifications to interaction distance. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    player proximity checks before allowing an interaction, such as when determining
    if a player is within range of a chest or quest item.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObject pointer passed into this function is valid
    and initialized; passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crash. This method should not be used to determine whether a player can actually
    interact with an object, only the theoretical maximum distance allowed by configuration.
