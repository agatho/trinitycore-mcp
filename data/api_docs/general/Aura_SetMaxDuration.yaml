  class: Aura
  method: SetMaxDuration
  signature: void Aura::SetMaxDuration(int32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum duration of the aura to the specified value in milliseconds.
  description: The SetMaxDuration method configures the maximum lifetime of an Aura
    instance, determining how long the aura can persist before it expires. This value
    is typically used in conjunction with the aura's current duration to manage its
    behavior during gameplay. The method directly modifies the internal max duration
    field of the aura object. It's important to note that this change affects only
    the maximum allowed duration and does not immediately alter the current duration
    unless explicitly handled by the calling code. This method is commonly used when
    applying buffs or debuffs with specific time constraints, such as temporary stat
    modifications or harmful effects.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The new maximum duration for the aura in milliseconds. A value of
      0 or negative values typically indicate infinite duration or immediate expiration
      depending on implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 30-second maximum duration
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetMaxDuration(30000);\
      \ // Set to 30 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting infinite duration for an aura
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n{\n    aura->SetMaxDuration(0);\
      \ // Infinite duration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the aura's maximum duration directly without affecting
    its current duration. If the current duration exceeds the new max duration, the
    aura will still expire at its current time unless manually adjusted. The change
    takes effect immediately upon calling this method.
  warnings: Modifying the maximum duration of an active aura may have unintended consequences
    on gameplay mechanics. Ensure that changes to duration align with intended game
    behavior and do not cause unexpected interactions with other systems like stacking
    rules or proc timing.
