  class: InterruptManager
  method: OptimizeInterruptRotation
  signature: void InterruptManager::OptimizeInterruptRotation()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the interrupt rotation for the InterruptManager by reordering and
    prioritizing interrupt abilities based on threat and cooldown status.
  description: The OptimizeInterruptRotation method is responsible for dynamically
    adjusting the sequence in which interrupt abilities are applied within the InterruptManager.
    This optimization ensures that the most effective interrupts are executed first,
    considering factors such as target threat level, ability cooldowns, and available
    mana or energy resources. The method evaluates the current state of all possible
    interrupt abilities and reorders them to maximize combat efficiency and reduce
    the chance of successful enemy spell casting. It is typically invoked during combat
    updates or when interrupt conditions change, allowing for adaptive interrupt behavior
    that responds to evolving battlefield dynamics.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_interruptManager)\n    \
      \    m_interruptManager->OptimizeInterruptRotation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    optimal interrupt performance. It may have performance implications if used excessively
    in tight loops without proper throttling.
  warnings: The method assumes that all interrupt abilities are properly registered
    with the InterruptManager and that their cooldowns and resource requirements are
    correctly tracked. Failure to register interrupts properly may result in suboptimal
    rotation decisions.
