api:
  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: CheckEmergencySituations
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::CheckEmergencySituations()
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates current threat levels and triggers emergency responses for NPCs
    under high threat conditions.
  description: The CheckEmergencySituations method is responsible for assessing the
    current state of threat coordination within the AI system. It evaluates whether
    any creatures or NPCs are in a critical threat situation that requires immediate
    intervention, such as when a mob's threat level exceeds predefined thresholds
    or when emergency protocols need activation. This method typically integrates
    with the overall threat management system to ensure that high-priority situations
    are handled appropriately, potentially triggering defensive behaviors, summoning
    assistance, or altering AI decision-making processes.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_ThreatCoordinator->CheckEmergencySituations();\n    // ... rest of AI\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain proper threat coordination. It may perform checks
    on multiple targets simultaneously, so performance considerations are important
    in high-traffic areas.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called excessively within tight loops as
    it might impact performance. Also, calling this method outside of the proper AI
    context could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
