  brief: Checks if the bot is currently online and connected to the game world
  description: The IsOnline method determines whether a bot instance is actively connected
    to the TrinityCore server and present in the game world. This method typically
    checks the internal state of the bot's connection, ensuring that it has completed
    the login process and is able to receive and send game events. It is commonly
    used by bot management systems to verify that a bot is ready for commands or actions.
    The method does not perform any network operations itself but relies on cached
    connection status information maintained by the bot lifecycle manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is online and connected to the game world, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the bot has successfully logged in and is able
    to interact with the game environment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot status
    code: "if (botLifecycle.IsOnline()) {\n    // Bot is online, proceed with commands\n\
      \    bot->MoveToTarget();\n} else {\n    // Bot is offline, handle accordingly\n\
      \    LogMessage(\"Bot is not online\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a loop to monitor bot status
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (botLifecycle.IsOnline()) {\n        // Perform\
      \ online actions\n        bot->PerformDailyQuests();\n    } else {\n       \
      \ // Attempt to reconnect or log error\n        bot->Reconnect();\n    }\n \
      \   std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(30));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking rather than real-time network
    checks. The online status may not immediately reflect connection changes due to
    caching. For high-precision connection monitoring, consider combining with other
    methods like IsConnected() or checking the bot's session state directly.
  warnings: The method may return false for bots that are in transition states (logging
    in, reconnecting) even though they might be functional. Always verify the actual
    game state before performing critical actions based on this result.
