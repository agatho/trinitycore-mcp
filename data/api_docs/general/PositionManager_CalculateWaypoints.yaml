  method: CalculateWaypoints
  signature: int PositionManager::CalculateWaypoints(const int & from, const int &
    to)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of waypoints between two positions in the
    game world.
  description: The CalculateWaypoints method determines the number of waypoints required
    to navigate from a starting position to a destination position within the TrinityCore
    WoW emulator. This method is typically used for pathfinding calculations, particularly
    when dealing with NPC movement or player teleportation logic. The method likely
    utilizes internal navigation mesh data or grid-based pathfinding algorithms to
    compute the route and return the count of intermediate points needed to reach
    the target location. It assumes both input positions are valid within the game
    world boundaries and may perform bounds checking or validation before processing.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting position identifier or index used to determine the beginning
      point for waypoint calculation.
  - name: to
    description: The destination position identifier or index used to determine the
      endpoint for waypoint calculation.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of waypoints required
    to travel from the 'from' position to the 'to' position. A return value of 0 indicates
    no path exists or both positions are identical. Negative values may indicate error
    conditions such as invalid input parameters or out-of-bounds positions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Waypoint Calculation
    code: "PositionManager posMgr;\nint waypoints = posMgr.CalculateWaypoints(100,\
      \ 200);\nif (waypoints >= 0) {\n    printf(\"Path requires %d waypoints\\n\"\
      , waypoints);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Error calculating path\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Waypoint Count for Movement Logic
    code: "PositionManager posMgr;\nint startId = player->GetPositionX();\nint endId\
      \ = npc->GetPositionY();\nint numWaypoints = posMgr.CalculateWaypoints(startId,\
      \ endId);\nif (numWaypoints > 0) {\n    // Proceed with movement logic using\
      \ calculated waypoints\n    player->SetMovementSpeed(numWaypoints * 0.1f);\n\
      } else if (numWaypoints == 0) {\n    // Start and end are same location\n  \
      \  player->SendMoveSpline();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger pathfinding system that may cache
    results or use precomputed navigation data. It's important to ensure that the
    'from' and 'to' parameters represent valid positions within the game world's coordinate
    system. The implementation might involve complex algorithms such as A* search
    or grid-based traversal depending on the specific TrinityCore version and configuration.
  warnings: Passing invalid position identifiers (e.g., out-of-bounds coordinates)
    may result in undefined behavior or negative return values indicating errors.
    This method should not be called with null or uninitialized position data. In
    performance-critical scenarios, repeated calls to this method without caching
    may impact server performance due to pathfinding computations.
