  method: RemoveAllGroupBuffsFromCaster
  signature: void Unit::RemoveAllGroupBuffsFromCaster(int casterGUID)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all group buffs from a specified caster.
  description: This method removes all buff effects that were applied by a specific
    caster from the unit's aura list. It is commonly used in group settings where
    a player or creature needs to remove all buffs they have applied to other members
    of their group. The method ensures that only buffs originating from the specified
    caster are removed, preserving other buffs that may be present on the unit.
  parameters:
  - name: casterGUID
    description: The GUID of the caster whose buffs should be removed from the unit.
      This parameter identifies which specific caster's buffs will be targeted for
      removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetPlayer();

      Unit* caster = GetCreature();

      uint64 casterGUID = caster->GetGUID();

      target->RemoveAllGroupBuffsFromCaster(casterGUID);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely uses internal aura tracking mechanisms
    to identify and remove buffs from the specified caster. Performance considerations
    include potential overhead when removing multiple auras, especially in high-frequency
    scenarios such as group combat situations.'
  warnings: This method should not be used in contexts where it might interfere with
    other game mechanics like player vs player combat or raid encounters, as it could
    cause unexpected behavior if applied to non-group members. Also, ensure that the
    casterGUID is valid before calling this method, otherwise it may lead to undefined
    behavior.
