  brief: Sends currency information to the player's client
  description: This method sends the player's current currency information to their
    client, including all available currencies and their amounts. It is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to update the player's currency display in the game
    UI. The method ensures that the player's currency data is properly synchronized
    with the client, allowing for accurate display of resources such as honor points,
    arena team points, and other in-game currencies. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining game balance and player experience.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendCurrencies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when currency changes
    occur, and should not be directly invoked by external code. It may trigger client-side
    updates that could impact performance if called too frequently.
  warnings: The method should only be used in appropriate contexts where currency
    data needs to be updated for the player. Calling it unnecessarily may cause client-side
    updates that could affect server performance.
