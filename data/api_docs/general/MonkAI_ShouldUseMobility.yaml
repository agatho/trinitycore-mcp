api:
  class: MonkAI
  method: ShouldUseMobility
  signature: bool MonkAI::ShouldUseMobility(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Monk AI should use a mobility ability on the current
    target.
  description: The ShouldUseMobility method evaluates the current combat situation
    and target conditions to decide if a mobility-based ability (such as Paralysis,
    Dodge, or similar) should be used. This decision is based on factors like target
    threat level, distance, player health, and cooldown status of the mobility ability.
    The method returns true when it's advantageous to use such an ability, and false
    otherwise. It may also update the target parameter to reflect a more suitable
    combat target if needed.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the current target's ID. The method
      may modify this value to suggest a new target if mobility is better used against
      a different enemy.
  returns: Returns true if the Monk AI should use a mobility ability on the current
    or updated target; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "int currentTarget = ai->GetTarget();\nif (monkAI->ShouldUseMobility(&currentTarget))\
      \ {\n    // Execute mobility ability\n    ai->CastSpell(MOBILITY_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using updated target from method
    code: "int targetId = ai->GetTarget();\nif (monkAI->ShouldUseMobility(&targetId))\
      \ {\n    // Target might have been updated\n    ai->SetTarget(targetId);\n \
      \   ai->CastSpell(MOBILITY_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's decision-making process and integrates
    with the overall combat state. It assumes that the AI has access to target information,
    health status, and spell cooldowns. The actual implementation may vary depending
    on the specific monk class specialization (Windwalker, Mistweaver, etc.) and current
    game mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is properly initialized before calling
    this method; otherwise, unexpected behavior or crashes might occur. Also, be cautious
    when modifying the target ID directly in response to this method's return value,
    as it may affect other parts of the AI logic.
