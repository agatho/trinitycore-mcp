  method: SetDurability
  signature: void Item::SetDurability(uint32 durability)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the durability value of an item to the specified maximum durability.
  description: The SetDurability method updates the durability of an Item object to
    a given value, effectively setting the item's current durability to the specified
    maximum durability. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft development
    to control item condition and prevent item degradation. It directly affects the
    item's durability state, which influences gameplay mechanics such as item repair,
    equipment replacement, and player experience. The method does not perform any
    validation checks on the input value, so developers should ensure that the provided
    durability value is within valid limits for the item type.
  parameters:
  - name: durability
    description: The maximum durability value to set for the item. This value represents
      the current durability of the item and must be a valid uint32 value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetDurability(100);

      // Sets the item''s durability to 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      uint32 maxDurability = 500;

      item->SetDurability(maxDurability);

      // Sets the item''s durability to 500, ensuring it''s within valid limits'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the item's internal durability state without
    any validation or checks. Developers should ensure that the durability value is
    appropriate for the item type and does not exceed maximum limits. Performance-wise,
    this method is lightweight and does not involve complex calculations or database
    operations.
  warnings: This method does not validate the input durability value, so setting an
    invalid value may lead to unexpected behavior in game mechanics. Developers should
    be cautious when using this method with values that exceed item-specific limits
    or are outside valid ranges.
