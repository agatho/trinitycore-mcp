  signature: int Creature::GetRespawnPosition(float * dist) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn position coordinates of the creature.
  description: This method retrieves the respawn position coordinates of a creature,
    including the distance from the original spawn location. It is commonly used in
    creature AI and movement scripts to determine where a creature should respawn
    after death or despawn. The method returns an integer value representing the distance
    from the spawn point, which can be used for pathfinding or movement calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the distance from the spawn location to
    the respawn position. A value of 0 indicates that the creature has not yet respawned
    or is at its original spawn location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nint distance = creature->GetRespawnPosition();\n\
      if (distance > 0)\n{\n    // Creature has respawned\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Creature\
      \ is at original spawn location\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature movement
    or AI methods to determine respawn behavior. The distance returned may be used
    for pathfinding calculations or determining if a creature has respawned from its
    original location.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine exact respawn coordinates
    as it only returns the distance, not the actual coordinates. Care should be taken
    when using this in combination with other movement methods that might affect the
    creature's position.
