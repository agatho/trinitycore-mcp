documentation:
  brief: Consumes a clearcasting proc, removing its effect from the tracker.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for handling the consumption
    of a clearcasting proc within the ClearcastingTracker class. This method typically
    decreases the proc counter or clears the active state of the clearcasting effect.
    In the context of World of Warcraft mechanics, clearcasting is a spell proc that
    reduces the cast time of the next spell. When this proc is consumed, it signifies
    that the buff has been used and should no longer be active. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs no return operations, making it a simple state
    management function within the tracker system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ClearcastingTracker tracker;

      tracker.ConsumeProc();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a clearcasting proc is actually consumed,
    typically after a spell is cast that benefits from the proc. It's important to
    ensure proper synchronization if this method is used in a multi-threaded environment.
