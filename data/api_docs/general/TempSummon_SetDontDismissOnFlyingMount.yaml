documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the temporary summon should not be dismissed when the owner
    mounts a flying mount.
  description: This method configures the behavior of a temporary summon to prevent
    it from being automatically dismissed when its owner mounts a flying mount. This
    is commonly used for summoned creatures that should remain active during flight,
    such as certain pets or guardians. The setting affects only the dismissal logic
    based on mounting and does not influence other summon behaviors. This functionality
    is particularly relevant in scenarios where a player's summoned creature needs
    to accompany them while flying, ensuring continuity of gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: dontDismissOnFlyingMount
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether the summon should remain active
      when the owner mounts a flying mount. If true, the summon will not be dismissed;
      if false, it will follow normal dismissal rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Prevent Dismissal on Flying Mount
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = ...;

      summon->SetDontDismissOnFlyingMount(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Allow Normal Dismissal Behavior
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = ...;

      summon->SetDontDismissOnFlyingMount(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal summon state flags that control dismissal behavior
    during flight. It's important to call this before the summon is mounted or when
    setting up initial summon properties. The effect is immediate and persists until
    changed again.
