  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: AnalyzeGroupComposition
  signature: GroupComposition GroupCoordinator::AnalyzeGroupComposition() const
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns the current composition of the group including member
    counts, roles, and class distributions.
  description: The AnalyzeGroupComposition method evaluates the current state of a
    group managed by the GroupCoordinator, gathering detailed information about its
    members. It provides insights into player roles such as tanks, healers, and damage
    dealers, along with class distribution across the group. This analysis is crucial
    for dungeon finding systems, raid planning, and optimizing group performance in
    World of Warcraft scenarios. The method does not modify any group state but instead
    returns a structured GroupComposition object that encapsulates all relevant data
    about the group's makeup.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupComposition object containing detailed information about the group's
    current makeup, including member counts by role and class distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupComposition composition = groupCoordinator.AnalyzeGroupComposition();\n\
      if (composition.GetTotalMembers() > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Group has \" <<\
      \ composition.GetTotalMembers() << \" members\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Analysis
    code: 'GroupComposition composition = groupCoordinator.AnalyzeGroupComposition();

      std::cout << "Tanks: " << composition.GetTankCount() << ", Healers: " << composition.GetHealerCount()
      << ", DPS: " << composition.GetDpsCount();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full analysis of group members and may have performance
    implications in high-frequency scenarios. It should be called sparingly during
    critical gameplay moments to avoid lag. The returned GroupComposition object is
    immutable and represents a snapshot at the time of invocation.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for real-time combat decisions as it provides
    only static analysis. Changes in group composition after calling this method will
    not be reflected in the returned data unless re-invoked.
