  method: HandleAuraModPacify
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraModPacify(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the pacify aura effect that prevents the target from casting
    spells.
  description: The HandleAuraModPacify method manages the application and removal
    of the pacify aura effect, which disables the target's ability to cast spells.
    This aura effect is commonly used in game mechanics such as crowd control abilities,
    where a creature or player is silenced and unable to perform spellcasting actions.
    The method is invoked during aura application or removal phases and modifies the
    target's spell casting capabilities accordingly. It operates within the TrinityCore
    framework's aura system and interacts with the AuraApplication object to determine
    how the effect should be applied.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter determines the context in
      which the pacify effect is handled.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect, typically indicating whether
      it's being applied (1) or removed (0). This value controls how the effect is
      processed during the aura lifecycle.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag that specifies whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the pacify effect. When true, the target loses spellcasting capabilities; when
      false, they regain them.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying Pacify Aura
    code: 'AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target, caster, auraInfo);

      AuraEffect* effect = new AuraEffect();

      effect->HandleAuraModPacify(app, 1, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Pacify Aura
    code: 'AuraApplication* app = GetAuraApplication();

      AuraEffect* effect = GetAuraEffect();

      effect->HandleAuraModPacify(app, 0, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's aura handling system and directly
    affects spell casting mechanics. It should only be called during appropriate aura
    application/removal phases to avoid inconsistent game state. The effect modifies
    the target's unit flags and spell casting state, which may impact other systems
    that rely on these properties.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in inconsistent spell casting states
    or unexpected behavior for affected units. Ensure that the AuraApplication object
    is valid and properly initialized before calling this method. Incorrect mode or
    apply flag values may cause unintended effects on target's spellcasting abilities.
