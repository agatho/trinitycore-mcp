  method: ConsumeCharge
  signature: void FireBlastChargeTracker::ConsumeCharge()
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the charge count by one, potentially triggering cooldown or activation
    effects.
  description: The ConsumeCharge method is responsible for decrementing the internal
    charge counter of a FireBlastChargeTracker instance. This action typically represents
    the consumption of a single charge from a spell or ability that operates on a
    charge-based system. The method may perform additional logic such as checking
    if the charge count has reached zero, which could trigger cooldown activation,
    spell reset, or other related game mechanics. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with Fire Blast or similar abilities that have limited uses before requiring a
    recharge period.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Charge Consumption
    code: 'FireBlastChargeTracker tracker;

      tracker.ConsumeCharge(); // Decrements internal charge count by 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Charge Consumption with State Check
    code: "FireBlastChargeTracker tracker;\nif (tracker.GetCharges() > 0) {\n    tracker.ConsumeCharge();\n\
      \    // Perform spell activation or cooldown logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables and may be called from
    spell activation routines. It's important to ensure that charge consumption is
    only performed when valid, such as when the ability is not on cooldown or when
    sufficient charges remain.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying available charges may lead to unexpected
    behavior or invalid states. Ensure proper validation before invoking ConsumeCharge
    to avoid over-consumption of charges.
