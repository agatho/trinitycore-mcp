  class: DelveData
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void DelveData::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes delve data creation information to a ByteBuffer for player communication
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes delve data into a ByteBuffer format
    suitable for network transmission to players. This method is typically used when
    initializing or sending delve-related information from the server to clients,
    ensuring that player-specific delve data is properly formatted and transmitted.
    The method takes ownership and receiver player references to determine appropriate
    data serialization based on player context and permissions. It handles the low-level
    serialization process required for World of Warcraft's delve system integration.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized delve data will be
      written
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the delve
      data
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the recipient of the delve
      data
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ByteBuffer buffer;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      DelveData delveData;

      delveData.WriteCreate(buffer, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the delve system implementation and should only be
    called when delve data needs to be transmitted to players. The ByteBuffer must
    be properly initialized before calling this method. Implementation assumes valid
    player pointers and proper delve data state.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver player pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid pointers will cause undefined behavior. This method modifies
    the provided ByteBuffer directly without any validation of its current contents.
