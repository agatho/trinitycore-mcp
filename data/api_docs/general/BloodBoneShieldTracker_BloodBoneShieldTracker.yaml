  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BloodBoneShieldTracker class.
  description: The BloodBoneShieldTracker constructor initializes the tracking state
    for blood bone shields, setting up internal data structures and default values
    required for monitoring shield effects. This method is typically called when creating
    a new tracker instance to manage the state of blood bone shields on a player or
    creature. The initialization process ensures that all necessary variables are
    properly configured before any shield-related operations begin.

    of the BloodBoneShieldTracker class. It performs essential setup for tracking
    shield states and should not be called manually unless specifically required by
    advanced use cases.
