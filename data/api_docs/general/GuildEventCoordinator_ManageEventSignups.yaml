  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ManageEventSignups(int * player, uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Manages guild event signups by processing player participation for a specified
    event.
  description: The ManageEventSignups method handles the registration and management
    of players signing up for guild events. It takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the player identifier and a uint32 event ID, then processes the signup logic within
    the GuildEventCoordinator context. This method likely updates internal data structures
    tracking event participants, validates player eligibility, and may trigger notifications
    or updates to the guild's event system. The method operates within the TrinityCore
    framework's guild management subsystem and integrates with the broader event coordination
    infrastructure.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is signing up for the event. Must point to a valid player ID or nullptr.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the guild event that the player is attempting
      to sign up for. Must correspond to an existing event in the guild's event system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Signup
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ManageEventSignups(&playerId, 5001);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Signups
    code: "std::vector<int> playerIds = {12345, 12346, 12347};\nGuildEventCoordinator\
      \ coordinator;\nfor (int playerId : playerIds)\n{\n    coordinator.ManageEventSignups(&playerId,\
      \ 5001);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event tracking systems and
    may perform validation checks such as ensuring the player is a member of the guild,
    verifying event eligibility, and checking if the event has already started or
    ended. It may also update database records or send in-game notifications to other
    guild members.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to an initialized value
    before calling this method. Passing nullptr for the player parameter could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, verify that the eventId corresponds to
    a valid event; otherwise, the method may silently fail or produce unexpected results.
