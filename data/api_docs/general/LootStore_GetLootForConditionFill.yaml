  signature: LootTemplate * LootStore::GetLootForConditionFill(uint32 loot_id)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot template associated with a specific loot ID for condition-based
    loot filling.
  description: The GetLootForConditionFill method retrieves a LootTemplate object
    from the internal loot store based on the provided loot_id. This method is typically
    used during loot generation processes where conditions need to be evaluated before
    determining which items should be added to a player's loot list. The returned
    LootTemplate contains all the loot entries and their associated conditions that
    are relevant for a specific loot source, such as a creature, game object, or quest.
    It allows for dynamic loot distribution based on in-game conditions like player
    faction, quest status, or other criteria defined in the loot template.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the LootTemplate object associated with the specified loot_id.
    Returns nullptr if no loot template exists for the given ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "LootTemplate* lootTemplate = lootStore->GetLootForConditionFill(12345);\n\
      if (lootTemplate)\n{\n    // Process the loot template for condition-based filling\n\
      \    lootTemplate->FillLoot(loot, LootTemplates::LOOT_TEMPLATE_CREATURE, player,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Condition-Based Loot Processing
    code: "uint32 lootId = creature->GetLootId();\nLootTemplate* template = lootStore->GetLootForConditionFill(lootId);\n\
      if (template && player)\n{\n    // Fill loot with conditions applied\n    template->FillLoot(creatureLoot,\
      \ LootTemplates::LOOT_TEMPLATE_CREATURE, player, true);\n    // Process the\
      \ filled loot\n    creatureLoot->AddLoot(template, player, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal loot storage and should only be called when
    the loot system is properly initialized. The returned LootTemplate pointer is
    valid only as long as the loot store remains active and the template has not been
    removed. This method does not perform any validation on the loot_id parameter,
    so calling with an invalid ID may return nullptr.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent loot_id will return
    a null pointer. Always check for null before using the returned LootTemplate.
    This method is typically used internally by the loot system and should not be
    called directly in most cases unless implementing custom loot logic.
