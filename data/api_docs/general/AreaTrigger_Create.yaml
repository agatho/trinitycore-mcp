documentation:
  brief: Creates an area trigger with specified properties and associated data.
  description: The Create method initializes and spawns an AreaTrigger instance within
    the game world using provided creation parameters. It handles the setup of trigger
    properties, duration, spawn data, caster, target, visual effects, spell information,
    and aura effects. The method returns true upon successful creation or false if
    any required parameter is invalid or the trigger cannot be spawned. This functionality
    is commonly used for spells that generate area-based effects such as traps, auras,
    or environmental triggers in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTriggerCreatePropertiesId
    description: Unique identifier for the area trigger creation properties defining
      its behavior and characteristics.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the map object where the area trigger will be created.
      May be null if not explicitly required.
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to the position (x, y, z coordinates) where the area trigger
      should spawn.
  - name: duration
    description: Duration in milliseconds for which the area trigger remains active.
  - name: spawnData
    description: Pointer to optional spawn data structure containing additional configuration
      for the area trigger's spawning behavior.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit that casted the spell or initiated the area trigger.
      Can be null if not applicable.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit for which the area trigger is intended.
      May be null if not required.
  - name: spellVisual
    description: Visual effect ID associated with the spell that created this area
      trigger.
  - name: spellInfo
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell that caused this area trigger.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the spell ID associated with this
      area trigger. May be null if not applicable.
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect that triggered this area trigger, used
      for aura-specific behavior and effects.
  returns: True if the area trigger was successfully created and initialized; false
    otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid parameters, map issues, or resource
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Area Trigger Creation
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      int mapId = 0;

      float position[3] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      Unit* caster = player;

      Unit* target = enemy;

      int duration = 5000;

      int spellVisualId = 12345;

      const SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(1234);

      bool success = trigger->Create(1001, &mapId, position, duration, nullptr, caster,
      target, spellVisualId, spellInfo, nullptr, nullptr);'

  - title: Advanced Area Trigger with Aura Effect
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();

      float position[3] = {500.0f, 600.0f, 700.0f};

      Unit* caster = nullptr;

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system when an area
    trigger spell is cast. It performs necessary validation of inputs and ensures
    proper integration with the game world's object management system. The method
    does not directly handle destruction or cleanup; that responsibility lies with
    the AreaTrigger's destructor or cleanup routines.
  warnings: Ensure all pointers passed to this function are valid before calling,
    especially 'caster', 'target', 'spellInfo', and 'aurEff'. Passing null values
    for required parameters may lead to undefined behavior or failed creation. The
    'pos' parameter must be a valid reference to an array of at least three floats
    representing x, y, z coordinates.
