  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: IsStatisticsTrackingEnabled
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsStatisticsTrackingEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether trade statistics tracking is enabled for player bots.
  description: This method checks the configuration state to determine if player bot
    trade statistics are being tracked. It returns a boolean value indicating the
    current tracking status. This functionality is typically used in automated trading
    systems or bot behavior logic where statistical data about trades needs to be
    collected and analyzed. The method does not modify any internal state and simply
    queries the configuration setting.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if trade statistics tracking is enabled, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if trade statistics are enabled
    code: "if (playerbotTradeConfig.IsStatisticsTrackingEnabled()) {\n    // Enable\
      \ detailed trade logging\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbot\", \"Trade statistics tracking\
      \ is enabled\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a configuration file or runtime setting. It's
    designed to be lightweight and fast, as it may be called frequently during bot
    operation. The actual implementation details depend on how the PlayerbotTradeConfig
    class stores its state.
