  class: Transport
  method: GetPositionWithOffset
  signature: int Transport::GetPositionWithOffset(const int & offset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current position of the transport with an applied offset value.
  description: The GetPositionWithOffset method calculates and returns the adjusted
    position of a transport object based on a provided offset parameter. This method
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine the precise
    location of transports such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving game entities.
    The offset value modifies the base position of the transport, which can be useful
    for calculating passenger positions, spawn points, or interaction zones relative
    to the transport's movement. This method does not modify the internal state of
    the transport but rather provides a computed result based on current position
    and the given offset.
  parameters:
  - name: offset
    description: An integer value that represents the offset to be applied to the
      transport's base position. The offset can be positive or negative and typically
      represents a distance in game units (such as yards or meters) from the transport's
      default location.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated position of the transport
    with the specified offset applied. The exact meaning of this value depends on
    the context of use, but it commonly represents a coordinate value along one axis
    (X, Y, or Z) or a combined position value depending on how the transport's positioning
    system is implemented.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get adjusted transport position
    code: int currentPos = transport->GetPositionWithOffset(50); // Gets transport
      position with 50-unit offset
    language: cpp
  - title: Using negative offset for reverse positioning
    code: int backwardPos = transport->GetPositionWithOffset(-25); // Gets transport
      position with 25-unit backward offset
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger transport management system in TrinityCore.
    The offset parameter may be used to calculate passenger positions, NPC spawn points,
    or other game elements that need to be positioned relative to moving transports.
    Since this is a const method, it does not alter the state of the transport object.
  warnings: Ensure that the offset value provided is within expected ranges for your
    use case, as extremely large values may cause unexpected positioning behavior.
    The return value should be interpreted in the context of the coordinate system
    used by the transport's positioning logic.
