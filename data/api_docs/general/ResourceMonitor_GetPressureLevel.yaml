documentation:
  brief: Returns the current resource pressure level of the server
  description: The GetPressureLevel method retrieves the current resource pressure
    level of the TrinityCore server instance. This value indicates how heavily the
    system resources (CPU, memory, network) are being utilized. The returned ResourcePressure
    enum provides a standardized way to categorize the pressure level into distinct
    states such as Normal, Warning, or Critical. This information is crucial for server
    administrators and automated monitoring systems to make decisions about resource
    allocation, scaling, or alerting. The method performs no side effects and is safe
    to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ResourcePressure enum value representing the current system resource
    pressure level. Possible values typically include Normal, Warning, and Critical,
    indicating the severity of resource utilization on the server.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ResourcePressure pressure = sResourceMonitor->GetPressureLevel();\nif (pressure\
      \ == ResourcePressure::Critical) {\n    // Handle critical resource pressure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Critical resource pressure detected!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Resource Pressure
    code: "void CheckServerHealth() {\n    ResourcePressure level = sResourceMonitor->GetPressureLevel();\n\
      \    switch (level) {\n        case ResourcePressure::Normal:\n            sLog->outInfo(\"\
      Server resources are normal.\");\n            break;\n        case ResourcePressure::Warning:\n\
      \            sLog->outWarning(\"Server resource pressure is high.\");\n    \
      \        break;\n        case ResourcePressure::Critical:\n            sLog->outError(\"\
      Server resource pressure is critical!\");\n            // Trigger emergency\
      \ measures\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable
    for frequent polling. The ResourcePressure enum values are typically updated at
    regular intervals by the ResourceMonitor subsystem. The implementation may use
    various system metrics such as CPU usage percentage, memory consumption, and network
    I/O to determine the pressure level.
  warnings: The returned ResourcePressure value is only as accurate as the underlying
    monitoring system's sampling rate and measurement methods. In high-frequency scenarios,
    calling this method too often might introduce unnecessary overhead even though
    it's designed to be efficient.
