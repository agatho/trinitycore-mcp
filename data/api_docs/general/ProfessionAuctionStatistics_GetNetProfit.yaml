  signature: uint32 ProfessionAuctionStatistics::GetNetProfit() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the net profit from profession auction activities.
  description: The GetNetProfit method computes the total net profit generated from
    all auction house transactions related to a specific profession. It aggregates
    the profits from successful sales while accounting for various costs such as auction
    house fees, item durability loss, and other transaction-related expenses. This
    method is typically used in the context of tracking player economic activity within
    the game's auction house system, particularly for professions that involve crafting
    and selling items. The calculation considers both incoming revenue and outgoing
    costs to determine the true financial gain or loss from these transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total net profit in copper coins.
    A value of zero indicates no profit or loss, while positive values indicate profit
    and negative values (if applicable) would indicate losses.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 profit = professionStats->GetNetProfit();

      printf("Net profit: %u copper\n", profit);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House Logging
    code: "ProfessionAuctionStatistics* stats = player->GetProfessionAuctionStats(PROFESSION_ENGINERING);\n\
      uint32 netProfit = stats->GetNetProfit();\nif (netProfit > 0)\n{\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      auction\", \"Player earned {} copper from engineering auctions\", netProfit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on stored transaction data
    within the ProfessionAuctionStatistics object. It may cache results for performance
    reasons and should be called after all relevant auction transactions have been
    recorded. The method is designed to work with the TrinityCore's auction house
    system and assumes proper initialization of profession-related statistics.
  warnings: The method assumes that all relevant auction transactions have been properly
    recorded in the statistics object. If transaction data is incomplete or corrupted,
    the returned value may be inaccurate. Additionally, this method does not account
    for external factors such as item market fluctuations or currency conversion rates.
