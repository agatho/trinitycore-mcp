  method: Update
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot account manager's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of bot accounts within the TrinityCore system. It typically handles periodic
    tasks such as checking for expired bot sessions, updating account statistics,
    managing resource allocation, or performing cleanup operations. This method is
    usually called from the main game loop at regular intervals, using a time delta
    (diff) parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last update.
    The implementation may involve iterating through active bot accounts, applying
    time-based logic, and ensuring that all bot-related systems remain synchronized
    with the current game state.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetUpdateTime();\n    sBotAccountMgr->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop and should
    be called with accurate time deltas to ensure proper timing of bot account operations.
    The internal implementation may perform database operations or memory management,
    so it's important that this method does not block for extended periods.
