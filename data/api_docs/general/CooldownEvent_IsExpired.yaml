  class: CooldownEvent
  method: IsExpired
  signature: bool CooldownEvent::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a cooldown event has expired based on current time.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a cooldown event is currently in
    its expired state, meaning the cooldown period has completed and the associated
    ability or item can be used again. This method typically compares the internal
    expiration timestamp of the cooldown event against the current game time to make
    this determination. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, cooldowns are
    commonly used for spells, abilities, items, and other game mechanics that have
    restricted usage intervals. The method is often called during gameplay loops or
    when checking if an action can be performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the cooldown event has expired (i.e., the cooldown period
    has passed), false otherwise. This boolean value indicates whether the associated
    ability or item is ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (cooldownEvent.IsExpired()) {\n    // Cooldown has ended, allow action\n\
      \    PerformAction();\n} else {\n    // Still on cooldown\n    SendCooldownMessage();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Cooldown Logic
    code: "void Player::CastSpell(SpellInfo* spellInfo) {\n    if (cooldownEvent.IsExpired())\
      \ {\n        // Apply cooldown\n        SetCooldown(spellInfo->Id, spellInfo->RecoveryTime);\n\
      \        // Proceed with spell casting\n        DoCastSpell();\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Handle cooldown error\n        SendCastResult(SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate system time and may be affected by server
    time synchronization issues. It's commonly used in conjunction with other cooldown
    management functions such as GetCooldownRemaining() or SetCooldown(). The implementation
    likely uses internal timestamps stored within the CooldownEvent object to perform
    the comparison.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency loops as it may involve
    time comparisons that could impact performance if called excessively. Ensure proper
    synchronization if accessing cooldown events from multiple threads.
