documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PositionStrategyBase instance and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PositionStrategyBase class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    As a base class, it ensures proper cleanup of derived class members and maintains
    the integrity of the object lifecycle within the TrinityCore AI system. This method
    is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted,
    ensuring no memory leaks occur in pathfinding and positioning logic used by game
    entities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PositionStrategyBase
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    PositionStrategyBase* strategy = new SomeDerivedPositionStrategy();\n\
      \    // ... use strategy ...\n    delete strategy; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically not called directly by developers. It's automatically
    invoked during object destruction. The base class destructor should be declared
    as virtual to ensure proper cleanup of derived class objects when deleted through
    a base pointer.
