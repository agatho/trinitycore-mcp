  class: DestructionWarlockRefactored
  method: ConsumeSoulShard
  signature: void DestructionWarlockRefactored::ConsumeSoulShard(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified number of soul shards from the warlock's resource
    pool.
  description: The ConsumeSoulShard method reduces the current count of soul shards
    available to a destruction warlock by the provided amount. This method is typically
    invoked when casting spells that require soul shards as a resource, such as Shadow
    Bolt or Soul Fire. The method ensures that the warlock has sufficient soul shards
    before consuming them, and will not allow negative shard counts. It is an integral
    part of the destruction warlock's gameplay mechanics, directly affecting spell
    casting and resource management. This method does not trigger any visual effects
    or animations; it only modifies internal resource tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The number of soul shards to consume from the warlock's resource
      pool. Must be a positive integer representing the shard count required for spell
      casting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume One Soul Shard
    code: 'DestructionWarlockRefactored* warlock = ...;

      warlock->ConsumeSoulShard(1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume Multiple Soul Shards for a High-Damage Spell
    code: 'DestructionWarlockRefactored* warlock = ...;

      uint32 shardsToConsume = 3;

      warlock->ConsumeSoulShard(shardsToConsume);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling code has already verified that the warlock
    possesses at least the specified number of soul shards. The implementation should
    be called only after checking resource availability to prevent invalid operations.
    This is a core mechanic for destruction warlocks and directly impacts gameplay
    balance.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying shard availability may lead to inconsistent
    state or unexpected behavior. Always ensure that sufficient soul shards exist
    before invoking this method to avoid potential bugs in spell casting logic.
