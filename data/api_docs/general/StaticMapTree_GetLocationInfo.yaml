    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves detailed location information for a given position within the static
    map tree.
  description: The GetLocationInfo method is used to obtain detailed spatial data
    about a specific point in the game world. It takes a position identifier and populates
    a LocationInfo structure with relevant geographic and navigational data. This
    method is typically used by the collision detection and pathfinding systems to
    determine if a location is valid, accessible, or to retrieve terrain information
    for objects placed in the world. The method operates on static map data that represents
    the fixed geometry of the game environment, such as terrain heights, walkable
    surfaces, and obstacles. It's an essential part of the TrinityCore's static map
    tree system which handles efficient spatial queries for large-scale game worlds.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the static
      map tree. This is typically a unique index or hash value that corresponds to
      a location within the spatial data structure.
  returns: Returns true if the location information was successfully retrieved and
    populated into the provided LocationInfo structure; returns false if the position
    identifier is invalid or out of bounds, indicating that no valid location data
    exists for the given position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve location info
    code: "LocationInfo info;\nint positionId = 12345;\nif (mapTree->GetLocationInfo(positionId,\
      \ info)) {\n    // Successfully retrieved location data\n    printf(\"Height:\
      \ %f, Walkable: %s\\n\", info.height, info.walkable ? \"true\" : \"false\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Invalid position or error occurred\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ retrieve location info for position %d\\n\", positionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the static map tree system which caches and indexes
    terrain data for fast spatial queries. The performance of this method depends
    on the underlying data structure implementation, typically using spatial partitioning
    techniques like octrees or BSP trees. Developers should ensure that position identifiers
    are valid before calling this method to avoid unnecessary error conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid position identifiers may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect data being returned. It's important to validate input parameters
    and handle the false return value appropriately to prevent runtime errors in pathfinding
    or collision detection systems.
