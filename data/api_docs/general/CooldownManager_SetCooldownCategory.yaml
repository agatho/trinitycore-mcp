  class: CooldownManager
  method: SetCooldownCategory
  signature: void CooldownManager::SetCooldownCategory(uint32 spellId, uint32 categoryId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cooldown category for a specified spell ID within the CooldownManager.
  description: The SetCooldownCategory method assigns a specific cooldown category
    to a given spell ID in the CooldownManager. This functionality is used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage spell cooldowns and their interactions with
    other spells that share the same cooldown category. When two or more spells share
    the same cooldown category, they cannot be cast simultaneously until the cooldown
    period for that category expires. The method directly modifies internal cooldown
    tracking data structures within the manager.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to assign a cooldown category
      to. Must be a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  - name: categoryId
    description: The cooldown category ID that the spell will belong to. Spells with
      matching category IDs will share cooldowns and cannot be cast simultaneously.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a Cooldown Category to a Spell
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->SetCooldownCategory(12345, 67890); // Assign spell ID 12345 to cooldown
      category 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Spells in Same Category
    code: 'CooldownManager* cm = player->GetCooldownManager();

      cm->SetCooldownCategory(1001, 5000);

      cm->SetCooldownCategory(1002, 5000);

      cm->SetCooldownCategory(1003, 5000); // All three spells share cooldown category
      5000'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state of the CooldownManager and should only
    be called during appropriate game state transitions or initialization. The categoryId
    parameter must correspond to a valid cooldown category defined in the game's spell
    system. Changes made via this method are not persisted to database automatically.
  warnings: Modifying cooldown categories at runtime may cause unexpected behavior
    if not properly synchronized with the game's cooldown handling logic. Ensure that
    categoryId values are valid and do not conflict with existing spell definitions.
    Improper use can lead to spells being incorrectly blocked from casting.
