  class: RoleAssignment
  method: SetContentTypeRequirements
  signature: void RoleAssignment::SetContentTypeRequirements(uint32 contentId, const
    int & requirements)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the content type requirements for a role assignment based on a given
    content ID and requirement value.
  description: The SetContentTypeRequirements method configures the content type requirements
    associated with a specific role assignment. It takes a content identifier and
    an integer representing the required content type, likely used in determining
    access or eligibility for certain game features, quests, or instances. This method
    is typically part of a larger system that manages player roles and their corresponding
    permissions within the TrinityCore framework. The implementation may involve internal
    data structures such as maps or lists to associate content IDs with their respective
    requirement values.
  parameters:
  - name: contentId
    description: A unique identifier for the content type being assigned. This value
      is typically used to reference specific game content such as quests, instances,
      or zones.
  - name: requirements
    description: An integer representing the requirement level or type associated
      with the specified content ID. The exact meaning of this value depends on how
      it's interpreted within the context of role assignments and content access control.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RoleAssignment assignment;

      assignment.SetContentTypeRequirements(12345, 2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Multiple Content Requirements
    code: 'RoleAssignment assignment;

      assignment.SetContentTypeRequirements(1001, 1);

      assignment.SetContentTypeRequirements(1002, 3);

      assignment.SetContentTypeRequirements(1003, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state within the RoleAssignment object
    and may be used in conjunction with other methods to validate player eligibility
    for content. Ensure that the contentId is valid and corresponds to existing content
    entries in the game database.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of contentId or requirement values can lead to unexpected
    behavior in role-based access control systems. Always verify that content IDs
    are valid before calling this method.
