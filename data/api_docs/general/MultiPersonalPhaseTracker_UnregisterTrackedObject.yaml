  class: MultiPersonalPhaseTracker
  method: UnregisterTrackedObject
  signature: void MultiPersonalPhaseTracker::UnregisterTrackedObject(WorldObject *
    object)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a tracked WorldObject from the MultiPersonalPhaseTracker's internal
    tracking list.
  description: The UnregisterTrackedObject method removes a specified WorldObject
    from the internal tracking mechanism of the MultiPersonalPhaseTracker. This method
    is typically invoked when an object is no longer relevant for phase tracking,
    such as when it is destroyed, despawned, or when the player's phase changes in
    a way that excludes this object. The method ensures that the object is cleanly
    removed from any phase-related tracking structures without causing memory leaks
    or invalid references. It is important to note that calling this method on an
    object not currently tracked will typically result in no operation, and the method
    does not perform any validation checks beyond ensuring the object exists before
    attempting removal.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject instance to be removed from tracking.
      This parameter must not be null; passing a null pointer may result in undefined
      behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "WorldObject* trackedObject = player->GetMap()->GetGameObject(12345);\n\
      if (trackedObject)\n{\n    phaseTracker->UnregisterTrackedObject(trackedObject);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Phase Change
    code: "void OnPhaseChange(Player* player, uint32 newPhase)\n{\n    // Unregister\
      \ all previously tracked objects\n    for (auto& trackedObj : phaseTracker->GetTrackedObjects())\n\
      \    {\n        phaseTracker->UnregisterTrackedObject(trackedObj);\n    }\n\
      \    // Register new objects based on the new phase\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a phase tracking system that manages visibility and
    interaction of WorldObjects based on player phases. The internal implementation
    likely uses a container (such as std::set or std::unordered_set) to store tracked
    objects, and this method performs the removal operation efficiently. It is recommended
    to call this method before deleting or despawning an object to prevent dangling
    references.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the object exists and is valid before unregistering it.
    Additionally, be cautious when calling this method during iteration over tracked
    objects, as modifying the container during iteration may cause iterator invalidation
    or other issues.
