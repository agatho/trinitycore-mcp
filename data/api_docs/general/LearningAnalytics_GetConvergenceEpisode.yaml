  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetConvergenceEpisode
  signature: uint32_t LearningAnalytics::GetConvergenceEpisode(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the convergence episode identifier for a specified bot GUID.
  description: The GetConvergenceEpisode method retrieves the convergence episode
    identifier associated with a given bot GUID. This method is typically used in
    the context of learning analytics within the TrinityCore framework, particularly
    when tracking or analyzing the progression and behavior patterns of bots during
    training or simulation processes. The convergence episode represents a specific
    point in time or state where the bot's learning process has reached a stable or
    optimal condition. The method performs a lookup based on the provided bot GUID
    and returns the corresponding convergence episode value. This functionality is
    essential for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of AI-driven bot behaviors
    in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which to retrieve the
      convergence episode. This value must correspond to a valid bot within the system's
      tracking mechanisms.
  returns: Returns a uint32_t representing the convergence episode identifier associated
    with the specified bot GUID. If no convergence episode is found for the given
    GUID, the method may return zero or an undefined value depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32_t convergenceEpisode = learningAnalytics.GetConvergenceEpisode(12345);\n\
      if (convergenceEpisode != 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Convergence episode for bot\
      \ 12345: \" << convergenceEpisode << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"No convergence episode found for bot 12345\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LearningAnalytics class maintains an internal
    data structure mapping bot GUIDs to their respective convergence episodes. The
    performance of this lookup operation depends on how the mapping is implemented
    internally, potentially using hash tables or similar structures for efficient
    access.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to a valid and tracked bot;
    otherwise, the result may be unreliable or undefined. This method should not be
    called with invalid or uninitialized GUIDs without proper validation.
