  method: GetFlightDestinationForLeveling
  signature: uint32 FlightMasterManager::GetFlightDestinationForLeveling() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the flight destination ID used for leveling progressions.
  description: The GetFlightDestinationForLeveling method retrieves the unique identifier
    of a flight path destination that is specifically designated for character leveling
    purposes. This function is typically invoked during quest progression or when
    determining available flight paths based on player level requirements. The returned
    value corresponds to an entry in the game's flight path database, indicating where
    a player can fly to advance their character level. It ensures that only appropriate
    flight destinations are presented to players according to their current level
    and progression state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier (ID) of the flight destination
    used for leveling. This ID maps to an entry in the game's flight path database,
    which defines the destination's location, associated requirements, and other properties.
    Returns zero if no valid leveling flight destination is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 destinationId = flightMaster->GetFlightDestinationForLeveling();\n\
      if (destinationId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with flight path logic using the\
      \ destination ID\n    Player* player = ...;\n    player->AddCriteriaProgress(...);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal data structures related to flight master
    entries and player leveling requirements. It may be called during quest updates
    or when a player interacts with a flight master NPC. The implementation might
    cache results for performance reasons, especially in scenarios where multiple
    calls are made in quick succession.
  warnings: Ensure that the FlightMasterManager instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Calling it on an uninitialized or invalid object may result
    in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that the returned ID should only be used
    with valid flight path entries; using an incorrect ID could lead to client-side
    errors or missing destinations.
