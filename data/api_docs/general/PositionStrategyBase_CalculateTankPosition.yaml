  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CalculateTankPosition
  signature: int PositionStrategyBase::CalculateTankPosition(Player * bot, Unit *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for a bot to tank a target unit
    in World of Warcraft.
  description: The CalculateTankPosition method determines the best positioning strategy
    for a bot player to effectively hold aggro and manage threat while engaging a
    target unit. This method is typically used in AI-driven gameplay scenarios where
    the bot needs to maintain proper positioning relative to its target for optimal
    combat performance. The calculation considers factors such as target movement,
    bot's current location, and combat mechanics relevant to tanking roles. It returns
    an integer value representing the calculated position strategy index or identifier
    that can be used by the bot's AI system to execute appropriate movement behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      needs to calculate its tanking position. Must not be null.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target enemy that the
      bot is attempting to tank. Must not be null.
  returns: An integer value indicating the calculated tank position strategy. Positive
    values typically represent valid positioning strategies, while negative values
    may indicate failure or invalid conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Position Calculation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player\nUnit* target = ...; // Get target\
      \ unit\nint position = PositionStrategyBase::CalculateTankPosition(bot, target);\n\
      if (position >= 0)\n{\n    // Use calculated position for movement\n    // Implementation\
      \ details depend on specific AI system\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI framework and assumes that both
    bot and target are valid objects in the game world. The actual implementation
    may vary based on the specific subclass of PositionStrategyBase being used.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'bot' and 'target' parameters are valid non-null pointers
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
