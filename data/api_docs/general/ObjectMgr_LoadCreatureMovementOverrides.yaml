  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureMovementOverrides()
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature movement override data from the database into memory for use
    during runtime.
  description: The LoadCreatureMovementOverrides method initializes and populates
    internal data structures with movement override information for creatures stored
    in the database. This functionality allows server administrators to customize
    how specific creatures move, including waypoints, flight paths, or other movement
    behaviors that differ from default AI patterns. The method is typically invoked
    during server startup or reload operations to ensure all creature movement overrides
    are properly loaded and available for active game objects. It processes data from
    the creature_movement_override table in the database, mapping these overrides
    to their respective creature entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureMovementOverrides();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup sequence and should not
    be invoked repeatedly during runtime unless new movement overrides are added to
    the database. The loaded data is cached in memory for fast lookup during creature
    AI processing, so changes to the database require a reload or restart to take
    effect.
  warnings: Modifying the creature_movement_override table while the server is running
    may cause inconsistencies if LoadCreatureMovementOverrides is not called again
    to refresh the internal cache. This method does not validate data integrity and
    assumes all database entries are valid.
