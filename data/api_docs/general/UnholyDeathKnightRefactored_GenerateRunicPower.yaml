  class: UnholyDeathKnightRefactored
  method: GenerateRunicPower
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::GenerateRunicPower(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates runic power for the unholy death knight based on the specified
    amount.
  description: The GenerateRunicPower method increases the current runic power of
    an unholy death knight by a given amount. This method is typically invoked when
    the death knight performs actions that restore runic power, such as certain spells
    or abilities. The method directly modifies the internal runic power state of the
    player character without any external dependencies. It ensures that the runic
    power does not exceed the maximum allowed value for the death knight's current
    specialization and level.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of runic power to generate. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the power units to add to the death knight's current runic power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'UnholyDeathKnightRefactored* dk = ...;

      dk->GenerateRunicPower(10);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Runic Power Based on Spell Effect
    code: "void OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    if (spellInfo->Id\
      \ == 49998) // Death Strike\n        GenerateRunicPower(20);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the death knight object is properly initialized
    and that the amount parameter is valid. The implementation should handle overflow
    conditions gracefully by capping the runic power at the maximum allowed value
    for the player's level and specialization.
  warnings: Do not call this method with negative values as it may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect state management. Ensure that the death knight instance
    is valid before invoking this method to prevent segmentation faults.
