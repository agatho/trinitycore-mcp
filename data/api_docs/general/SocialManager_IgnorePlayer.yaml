documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the ignore list for the current session
  description: The IgnorePlayer method adds a specified player to the social ignore
    list for the current user session. This prevents the ignored player from sending
    whispers, friend requests, or other social communications. The method returns
    true if the player was successfully added to the ignore list, or false if the
    player was already ignored or if the operation failed. In World of Warcraft context,
    this mirrors the /ignore command functionality within the game client.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be ignored. This should
      be a valid player GUID from the game database.
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully added to the ignore list, false
    if the player was already ignored or if the operation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();\nbool result = socialMgr->IgnorePlayer(123456);\
      \ // Ignores player with GUID 123456\nif (result)\n{\n    // Player successfully\
      \ ignored\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();\nuint32 targetGuid = GetTargetPlayerGuid();\n\
      if (targetGuid != 0)\n{\n    bool success = socialMgr->IgnorePlayer(targetGuid);\n\
      \    if (!success)\n    {\n        // Player was already ignored or operation\
      \ failed\n        SendSystemMessage(\"Player is already ignored or could not\
      \ be ignored.\");\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Invalid player\
      \ GUID.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the client-side social manager and typically requires
    synchronization with the server to persist the ignore list across sessions. The
    implementation may involve checking against existing ignore lists, validating
    GUIDs, and potentially updating database records.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid is a valid and existing player GUID before calling
    this method. Attempting to ignore non-existent players may result in undefined
    behavior or silent failures. This operation does not prevent all forms of communication
    - it only affects social interactions like whispers and friend requests.
