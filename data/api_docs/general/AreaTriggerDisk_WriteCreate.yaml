  class: AreaTriggerDisk
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerDisk::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const AreaTrigger
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes area trigger disk creation data to a byte buffer for client synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of an AreaTriggerDisk
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for transmission to a specific player client.
    This method is typically invoked during the initial spawn or update of an area
    trigger disk effect in the game world. It ensures that the client receives all
    necessary information to render and manage the visual and functional aspects of
    the area trigger disk, including its position, size, orientation, and associated
    spell effects. The serialization process includes relevant metadata such as the
    owner's GUID, trigger parameters, and any custom flags or settings required for
    proper client-side behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized area trigger disk
      data will be written. This buffer is used to construct the packet sent to the
      client.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this disk. Used to retrieve
      owner-specific properties and state information for serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this data. May be used
      to determine visibility, filtering, or client-specific adjustments during serialization.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Update
    code: "void SendAreaTriggerDiskUpdate(Player* player, AreaTriggerDisk* disk)\n\
      {\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    disk->WriteCreate(data, disk->GetOwner(), player);\n\
      \    player->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Serialization for Specific Client
    code: "void SendDiskToPlayer(AreaTriggerDisk* disk, Player* receiver)\n{\n   \
      \ ByteBuffer buffer;\n    AreaTrigger const* owner = disk->GetOwner();\n   \
      \ if (owner)\n        disk->WriteCreate(buffer, owner, receiver);\n    else\n\
      \        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"entities.areatrigger\", \"AreaTriggerDisk has no owner!\"\
      );\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system and
    should be called only when preparing data for network transmission. It assumes
    that all necessary data members are properly initialized before invocation. The
    method does not perform any validation on input parameters beyond basic null checks,
    so callers must ensure validity.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method may result in client-side visual glitches
    or incorrect behavior of area trigger disks. Ensure that the provided 'owner'
    and 'receiver' parameters are valid and properly initialized to avoid undefined
    behavior or crashes.
