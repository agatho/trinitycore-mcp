  method: SetTarget
  signature: void ObjectCache::SetTarget(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target unit for this object cache instance.
  description: The SetTarget method assigns a target Unit to the ObjectCache instance,
    which is typically used in AI behavior systems to track and manage the current
    target of a creature or NPC. This method updates internal state to reflect the
    new target, enabling subsequent operations to reference the specified unit. The
    target unit must be a valid ::Unit pointer, and setting it to nullptr will clear
    the current target. This functionality is commonly utilized in combat AI logic
    where mobs need to maintain awareness of their target for attack decisions, movement,
    or spell casting.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the ::Unit object that will be set as the target. Can
      be nullptr to clear the current target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a target for an AI-controlled mob
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!me->GetVictim())\n    {\n\
      \        // Find a new target\n        Unit* target = me->SelectNearestTarget(50.0f);\n\
      \        if (target)\n        {\n            // Set the found target\n     \
      \       objectCache.SetTarget(target);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing target when no valid target exists
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() && !me->GetVictim()->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        // Clear the current target\n        objectCache.SetTarget(nullptr);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal state and should be called from within
    the context of the AI update loop or similar controlled environments. The target
    unit must remain valid for the duration of its use in the cache, otherwise accessing
    it may result in undefined behavior.
