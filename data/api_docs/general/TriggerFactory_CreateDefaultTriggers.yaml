documentation:
  brief: Initializes and registers default triggers for the TriggerFactory
  description: The CreateDefaultTriggers method is responsible for setting up and
    registering all predefined trigger objects within the TriggerFactory. This method
    typically initializes core game mechanics such as area triggers, event triggers,
    and other system-defined triggers that are essential for proper World of Warcraft
    gameplay behavior. It ensures that all default trigger configurations are loaded
    into memory and ready for use by the game's AI and event systems. The method performs
    necessary setup operations including validation checks and registration with the
    global trigger manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the operation.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as initialization failures
    or resource allocation issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "TriggerFactory factory;\nint result = factory.CreateDefaultTriggers();\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Triggers successfully created\n    printf(\"Default\
      \ triggers initialized successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to initialize default triggers with code: %d\\n\", result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    the TriggerFactory is first instantiated. The method may perform database lookups
    or configuration file reads, so it could have performance implications during
    startup. It's recommended to call this method only once per factory instance.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same TriggerFactory instance
    may result in duplicate trigger registrations or undefined behavior. Ensure that
    no triggers are actively being used when calling this method.
