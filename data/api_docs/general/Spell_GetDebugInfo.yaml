documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information for the spell, including its ID and cast time.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method retrieves comprehensive debug information about
    a spell instance, including its unique identifier and casting time details. This
    method is primarily used for debugging purposes within the TrinityCore framework,
    allowing developers to inspect spell properties during runtime. The returned value
    represents an integer that encapsulates various spell attributes, making it useful
    for identifying specific spell behaviors and performance characteristics in game
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents an integer containing debug information about
    the spell, including its ID and cast time. This value can be used to identify
    specific spell properties during runtime debugging sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      int debugInfo = spell->GetDebugInfo();

      // Returns integer containing spell ID and cast time information'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during development and debugging phases to
    inspect spell properties. It may have performance implications if called frequently
    during combat or in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: The method should not be used in production code without proper consideration
    of performance impact, as frequent calls could affect overall system performance.
