  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: WillCollideWithPath
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::WillCollideWithPath(const int & path,
    const ObstacleInfo & obstacle)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given path will collide with a specified obstacle.
  description: The WillCollideWithPath method evaluates if a predefined path, identified
    by an integer index, intersects or collides with a provided obstacle. This method
    is typically used in AI pathfinding and obstacle avoidance systems to prevent
    units from moving through solid objects or other entities. It performs geometric
    calculations to check for potential collisions between the path and the obstacle's
    boundaries. The method assumes that both the path and obstacle data are valid
    and properly initialized within the context of the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific path in the navigation
      system. This index should correspond to a valid path previously calculated or
      stored by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
  - name: obstacle
    description: An instance of ObstacleInfo that contains details about the obstacle,
      including its position, dimensions, and type. The obstacle data must be properly
      initialized for accurate collision detection.
  returns: Returns true if the specified path intersects with or collides with the
    given obstacle; otherwise returns false. A return value of true indicates that
    the path needs to be adjusted or avoided to prevent collision.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Collision Check
    code: "ObstacleAvoidanceManager manager;\nint pathIndex = 0;\nObstacleInfo obstacle;\n\
      bool willCollide = manager.WillCollideWithPath(pathIndex, obstacle);\nif (willCollide)\n\
      {\n    // Handle collision avoidance\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Pathfinding Logic
    code: "void Unit::UpdateMovement()\n{\n    ObstacleAvoidanceManager manager;\n\
      \    int currentPath = GetPathIndex();\n    for (auto& obstacle : GetNearbyObstacles())\n\
      \    {\n        if (manager.WillCollideWithPath(currentPath, obstacle))\n  \
      \      {\n            // Replan path to avoid obstacle\n            ReplanPath();\n\
      \            break;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI navigation system and relies on accurate positioning
    and sizing data for both paths and obstacles. Performance may be impacted when
    checking many obstacles against a single path, especially in dense environments.
    The method does not modify any internal state but only performs read-only collision
    checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the path index is valid before calling this method; invalid
    indices could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also, make sure that the
    obstacle data is up-to-date and reflects current positions to ensure accurate
    collision detection.
