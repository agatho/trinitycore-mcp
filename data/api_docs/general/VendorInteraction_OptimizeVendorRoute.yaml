api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: OptimizeVendorRoute
  signature: void VendorInteraction::OptimizeVendorRoute(Player * player, const int
    & needs)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the vendor interaction route for a player based on their needs.
  description: The OptimizeVendorRoute method calculates and applies an optimized
    path for a player to visit vendor NPCs in order to fulfill their item requirements.
    This optimization typically reduces the total travel distance or time required
    to complete purchases, improving efficiency during vendor interactions. The method
    considers the player's current location, available vendors in the vicinity, and
    the items needed based on the provided needs parameter. It is commonly used in
    automated purchasing systems or quest completion scripts where minimizing travel
    time is beneficial.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the vendor route is being optimized.
      Must not be null.
  - name: needs
    description: Reference to an integer representing the player's item requirements
      or needs. The value typically indicates how many items are needed, or a bitmask
      of required item types.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      int needs = 5;

      vendorInteraction->OptimizeVendorRoute(player, needs);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player) {\n    int itemNeeds = GetRequiredItemCountForQuest(player->GetQuestStatus(12345));\n\
      \    vendorInteraction->OptimizeVendorRoute(player, itemNeeds);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during vendor interactions to improve player
    efficiency. It may modify the player's movement path or internal vendor visit
    order. The needs parameter should be validated before calling this method to ensure
    correct behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the needs parameter reflects realistic item requirements
    to avoid unnecessary computations or incorrect routing.
