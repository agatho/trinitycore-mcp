    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one DeathRecoveryManager object to another
  description: The assignment operator for DeathRecoveryManager performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source object to the target object. This method
    is typically used when duplicating the state or configuration of a DeathRecoveryManager
    instance. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this would
    be relevant for managing player death recovery states and associated data such
    as resurrection timers, loot recovery settings, or other death-related mechanics.
    The operator ensures proper memory management and prevents shallow copying issues
    that could lead to double-free errors or undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source DeathRecoveryManager object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current DeathRecoveryManager object (this) after the
    assignment has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'DeathRecoveryManager manager1;

      DeathRecoveryManager manager2 = manager1; // Uses copy constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      manager2 = manager1; // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'DeathRecoveryManager mgr1, mgr2, mgr3;

      // Chaining assignments

      mgr1 = mgr2 = mgr3; // Each assignment returns a reference to the left-hand
      side'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying semantics to avoid issues with
    pointers or dynamically allocated memory within the DeathRecoveryManager class.
    It's important that this operator is properly implemented to maintain data integrity
    when managing player death recovery states in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that any member variables of DeathRecoveryManager that contain
    pointers or references are properly handled during assignment to prevent memory
    leaks or dangling pointer issues. This operator should not be confused with the
    copy constructor, which is called during object initialization.
