    spell effects. It processes the durability loss based on the spell's mechanics
    and can be triggered by various spell effects that affect item durability. The
    method operates within the context of World of Warcraft's item durability system,
    ensuring proper handling of item degradation during gameplay.

    by durability loss. It should be called only when the spell effect requires item
    durability damage, and must be properly integrated into the spell's execution
    flow.
