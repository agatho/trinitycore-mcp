documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another PhaseShift object to this object
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all phase shift data from the
    right-hand side PhaseShift object to the current object, leaving the source object
    in a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used for efficient
    resource management when swapping phase shift states between objects. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, phase shifts control which phases of the game
    world are visible to players, affecting visibility of objects, events, and areas
    based on phase masks. The move operation ensures that no unnecessary copying occurs,
    improving performance during frequent phase changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current PhaseShift object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'PhaseShift sourcePhase;

      // ... populate sourcePhase with phase data ...

      PhaseShift targetPhase = std::move(sourcePhase); // Uses operator=

      // sourcePhase is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Player Phase Management
    code: "void UpdatePlayerPhases(Player* player) {\n    PhaseShift newPhase;\n \
      \   // ... set up new phase ...\n    player->GetPhaseShift() = std::move(newPhase);\
      \ // Efficiently update player's phase\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation rather than a copy, making it more
    efficient for large phase shift objects. The source object after the move should
    not be used in any way that assumes valid state until it is reassigned or reset.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure all references to the source object are invalidated or reassigned
    before using them further.
