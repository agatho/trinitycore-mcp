  class: Player
  method: SetSpellFavorite
  signature: void Player::SetSpellFavorite(uint32 spellId, bool favorite)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a spell as favorite or non-favorite for the player.
  description: This method allows a player to mark a specific spell as either favorite
    or non-favorite in their spellbook. When a spell is marked as favorite, it appears
    at the top of the spell list in the character's spellbook and can be quickly accessed
    through the UI. The method modifies the player's spellbook behavior and affects
    how spells are displayed in the interface. This functionality is particularly
    useful for players who want to organize their spellbook by priority or frequently
    used spells.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be set as favorite or non-favorite.
      This must be a valid spell ID that exists in the player's spellbook.
  - name: favorite
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the spell should be marked as
      favorite (true) or non-favorite (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a spell as favorite
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      player->SetSpellFavorite(spellId, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set a spell as non-favorite
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      player->SetSpellFavorite(spellId, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell management
    functions and may affect UI display behavior. Implementation involves updating
    internal spellbook data structures and potentially triggering UI updates.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid spell IDs that exist in the
    player's spellbook. Calling it with invalid spell IDs may result in undefined
    behavior or errors.
