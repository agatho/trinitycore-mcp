  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: GroupStateMachine
  signature: void GroupStateMachine::GroupStateMachine(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a group state machine for a bot with the specified GUID.
  description: The GroupStateMachine constructor initializes a state machine instance
    for managing the group behavior of a bot identified by its GUID. This method sets
    up internal state tracking and prepares the bot for participation in group activities
    such as questing, combat, or movement coordination. The initialization process
    typically involves setting up group membership, assigning roles, and configuring
    behavior patterns based on the bot's class, level, and assigned group type. This
    constructor is usually invoked when a bot is added to a group or when a new group
    state machine needs to be created for group management purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot entity that this group state
      machine will manage. This GUID must correspond to an existing bot in the game
      world and is used to track the bot's state within the group context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Group State Machine for Bot
    code: 'GroupStateMachine* gsm = new GroupStateMachine(12345);

      // This creates a new group state machine for the bot with GUID 12345

      // The state machine is now ready to manage this bot''s group behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when a valid bot GUID is available
    and the bot exists in the game world. The GroupStateMachine instance must be properly
    managed to avoid memory leaks, as it likely holds references to bot data structures.
    Consider using smart pointers or proper RAII patterns for automatic cleanup.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot is actually
    registered in the game world before initializing its group state machine.
