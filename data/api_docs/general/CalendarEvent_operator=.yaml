documentation:
  brief: Moves a CalendarEvent object to another CalendarEvent object, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The move assignment operator for the CalendarEvent class transfers
    all resources from the source CalendarEvent object (passed as an rvalue reference)
    to the current object. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer
    ownership of dynamically allocated memory or other resources without performing
    deep copies. After the move, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state, suitable for immediate destruction or assignment. In the context of TrinityCore's
    calendar system, this allows efficient handling of event objects when they are
    reassigned or returned from functions, avoiding unnecessary copying of potentially
    large data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another CalendarEvent object whose resources
      will be moved to this object. This parameter must be an xvalue (temporary object)
      and cannot be a const or lvalue reference.
  returns: A reference to the current CalendarEvent object after the move operation
    has completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'CalendarEvent event1;

      CalendarEvent event2 = std::move(event1); // Uses move assignment

      // event1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Return with Move Assignment
    code: "CalendarEvent createEvent() {\n    CalendarEvent evt;\n    // ... populate\
      \ event ...\n    return evt; // Move semantics used for return\n}\n\nCalendarEvent\
      \ mainEvent = createEvent(); // Move assignment in action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics standard and is typically
    implemented using swap or direct resource transfer. The CalendarEvent class likely
    manages dynamic memory or other resources that benefit from move semantics, such
    as event data containers or internal buffers. When implementing this operator,
    developers should ensure that the source object's destructor can safely run after
    the move operation.
  warnings: Do not use the moved-from object after a move assignment unless you explicitly
    reset it or reassign it. The state of the source object post-move is valid but
    unspecified, and accessing its members may lead to undefined behavior if they
    rely on internal consistency.
