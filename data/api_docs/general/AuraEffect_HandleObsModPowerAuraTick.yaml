    const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or updates the modifier effect of an aura that modifies power regeneration
    rates for targets.
  description: The HandleObsModPowerAuraTick method is responsible for processing
    the periodic tick effect of auras that modify power regeneration. This method
    is typically invoked during the aura's tick update cycle, where it calculates
    and applies changes to a unit's power regeneration rate based on the aura's properties.
    It operates on both the target and caster units, ensuring proper application of
    modifiers such as increased mana regeneration or reduced energy drain. The method
    handles the core logic for updating the affected unit's power regeneration statistics
    during each tick interval.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object that is affected by this aura tick. This represents
      the target unit whose power regeneration will be modified.
  - name: caster
    description: The Unit object that cast the aura. This may be used to determine
      specific effects or modifiers based on the caster's properties, such as buffs
      or debuffs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Tick Application
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleObsModPowerAuraTick(Unit* target, Unit* caster)\
      \ const {\n    if (!target || !caster)\n        return;\n    \n    // Apply\
      \ modified power regeneration\n    float mod = GetAmount();\n    target->ModifyPowerRegen(mod);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the periodic aura tick processing system in TrinityCore.
    It should be called only during active aura ticks, typically within the aura's
    Update method or similar periodic update logic. The method assumes that the target
    and caster are valid and properly initialized units.
  warnings: Ensure that both target and caster parameters are non-null before calling
    this method to prevent crashes. This method modifies unit power regeneration directly,
    so care must be taken to avoid unintended side effects when combining multiple
    aura effects.
