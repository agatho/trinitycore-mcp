documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ConditionScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The ConditionScript destructor is responsible for cleaning up any resources
    allocated during the lifetime of a ConditionScript object. This includes releasing
    memory, unregistering callbacks, and ensuring proper cleanup of condition-related
    data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting system, this method
    ensures that custom conditions defined through the ConditionScript interface are
    properly torn down when the script instance is no longer needed. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when a ConditionScript object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of ConditionScript
    code: 'ConditionScript* script = new ConditionScript("MyCustomCondition");

      // ... use the script ...

      delete script; // Triggers ~ConditionScript()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless you are managing the
    object's lifetime manually. In most cases, the destruction is handled automatically
    by smart pointers or container classes. The ConditionScript base class may contain
    virtual methods that need to be properly overridden in derived classes to ensure
    complete cleanup.
  warnings: Ensure that no references to the ConditionScript object remain after deletion,
    as accessing freed memory can cause undefined behavior. If using inheritance,
    make sure derived class destructors are also properly defined to clean up their
    own resources before the base class destructor runs.
