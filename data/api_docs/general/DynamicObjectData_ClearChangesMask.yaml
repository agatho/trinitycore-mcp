  signature: void DynamicObjectData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the dynamic object, resetting its update state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a DynamicObjectData
    instance, effectively marking all fields as unchanged. This is typically used
    during the update process to ensure that only modified fields are sent to clients.
    The method clears any pending updates that would otherwise be transmitted in the
    next packet update cycle. It's commonly called after applying changes or when
    synchronizing the object state with the client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Object Modification
    code: 'DynamicObjectData* dynObj = ...;

      // Modify some fields of dynObj

      // ...

      dynObj->ClearChangesMask(); // Reset the changes mask after applying updates'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the update system in TrinityCore and should be called
    carefully to avoid losing track of pending changes. It's typically invoked internally
    by the core update loop but may also be used manually when implementing custom
    object behavior.
