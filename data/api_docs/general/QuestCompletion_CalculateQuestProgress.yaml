api:
  class: QuestCompletion
  method: CalculateQuestProgress
  signature: float QuestCompletion::CalculateQuestProgress(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the progress percentage of a specified quest for a
    given player bot.
  description: The CalculateQuestProgress method determines how much of a specific
    quest has been completed by a player bot. It evaluates the quest's current state,
    including objective fulfillment, item collection, and NPC interactions, then returns
    a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the completion percentage. This
    method is typically used in automated questing systems or AI-driven bots to assess
    quest advancement and make decisions about next steps. The method requires a valid
    quest ID and player reference, and it may involve database lookups or internal
    quest state tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to evaluate progress for. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest progress
      is being calculated. Must be a valid player instance with active quest data.
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no progress made
    on the quest, 1.0 indicates full completion, and values in between represent partial
    progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Progress Calculation
    code: "float progress = bot->GetQuestCompletion()->CalculateQuestProgress(12345,\
      \ bot);\nif (progress >= 1.0f) {\n    // Quest completed\n} else if (progress\
      \ > 0.5f) {\n    // Quest is more than half done\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Progress to Determine Next Action
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nPlayer* playerBot = GetBot();\nfloat progress\
      \ = playerBot->GetQuestCompletion()->CalculateQuestProgress(questId, playerBot);\n\
      \nif (progress < 0.3f) {\n    // Start gathering required items\n} else if (progress\
      \ >= 0.3f && progress < 0.7f) {\n    // Visit NPCs to complete objectives\n\
      } else if (progress >= 0.7f) {\n    // Return quest to NPC for reward\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries or internal state checks, so repeated
    calls could impact performance. It assumes the player bot has active quest data
    and that the quest ID is valid. The implementation likely uses internal quest
    tracking mechanisms provided by TrinityCore's quest system.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Calling with an invalid quest ID may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    progress calculations. This method should only be used for bots or automated systems,
    as it bypasses normal player interaction mechanics.
