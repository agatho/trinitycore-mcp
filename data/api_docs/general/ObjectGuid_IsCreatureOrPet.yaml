documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a creature or pet entity.
  description: The IsCreatureOrPet method checks if the ObjectGuid instance refers
    to a creature or pet object within the World of Warcraft game world. This method
    evaluates the type bits of the GUID to determine if it belongs to the creature
    or pet category. In TrinityCore, GUIDs are structured with type identifiers that
    categorize objects into different types such as players, creatures, pets, game
    objects, etc. The method returns true if the GUID represents a creature or pet,
    and false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in AI logic, targeting
    systems, and object interaction checks where specific entity types need to be
    identified.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a creature or pet entity; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if GUID is for a creature or pet
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(12345);\nif (guid.IsCreatureOrPet())\
      \ {\n    // Handle creature or pet specific logic\n    printf(\"This is a creature\
      \ or pet\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle other object types\n    printf(\"This\
      \ is not a creature or pet\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making for NPC behavior
    code: "class CreatureAI {\n    void UpdateAI() {\n        if (m_creatureGuid.IsCreatureOrPet())\
      \ {\n            // Perform actions specific to creatures or pets\n        \
      \    DoCombatBehavior();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal structure of ObjectGuid where type information
    is encoded in the high bits. It's important to note that this check only validates
    the object type category and does not verify if the actual object exists or is
    valid in the world. The implementation assumes standard TrinityCore GUID formatting
    conventions.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole validation for object existence.
    A valid GUID may not correspond to an active object in the game world. Additionally,
    when working with different GUID types, ensure that the high bits are properly
    interpreted according to TrinityCore's GUID structure.
