  method: ProcessCombatEvents
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::ProcessCombatEvents(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes combat-related events and updates bot AI behavior during active
    combat.
  description: The ProcessCombatEvents method is responsible for handling all combat-related
    logic within the EnhancedBotAI class. It evaluates the current combat state of
    the bot, manages spell casting decisions, updates target selection, and executes
    tactical actions based on the provided time delta. This method is typically called
    in the AI's update loop to ensure real-time responsiveness during fights. The
    method uses the passed diff parameter to determine how much time has elapsed since
    the last execution, which helps with timing-sensitive actions such as spell cooldowns
    and movement calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    ProcessCombatEvents(diff);\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat to maintain proper bot
    behavior. It is designed to be non-blocking and should not introduce significant
    delays in the AI update cycle. The method relies on internal state tracking of
    the bot's current target, health, and available spells.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations as it may cause unexpected
    behavior or performance issues due to unnecessary processing. Ensure that the
    bot has a valid target before calling this method to avoid null reference errors.
