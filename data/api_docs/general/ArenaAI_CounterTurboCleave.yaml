  class: ArenaAI
  method: CounterTurboCleave
  signature: void ArenaAI::CounterTurboCleave(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a counter attack against an opponent's Turbo Cleave ability in arena
    combat.
  description: The CounterTurboCleave method is designed to handle the AI response
    when a player performs a Turbo Cleave ability during arena combat. This method
    likely manages the arena AI's reaction to such an attack, potentially reducing
    damage taken or applying debuffs to the attacker. The method takes a pointer to
    an integer representing the player target and processes the countermeasures accordingly.
    It is part of the ArenaAI class which governs artificial intelligence behavior
    specific to arena battlegrounds in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the target player who performed
      the Turbo Cleave attack. This parameter identifies which opponent's action should
      be countered by the AI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "void MyArenaAI::HandleOpponentAttack(int* targetPlayer)\n{\n    CounterTurboCleave(targetPlayer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with arena combat system
    code: "class MyArenaAI : public ArenaAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnTurboCleaveUsed(int*\
      \ attacker)\n    {\n        if (attacker != nullptr)\n        {\n          \
      \  CounterTurboCleave(attacker);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the arena combat system when a
    Turbo Cleave ability is detected. The player parameter may be used to determine
    which specific opponent's attack should be countered, and the implementation might
    involve damage reduction calculations or debuff application. The method signature
    suggests it modifies the state of the AI in response to the attack.
  warnings: The method expects a valid pointer to an integer representing a player;
    passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Since this is part of
    the arena AI system, improper handling might affect gameplay balance or cause
    crashes during arena matches.
