  brief: Loads destructible hitpoint data for game objects from the database
  description: The LoadDestructibleHitpoints method initializes and loads destructible
    hitpoint information for game objects such as doors, walls, and other interactive
    environment elements. This method is typically called during server startup or
    database reload operations to ensure that all destructible object hitpoint configurations
    are properly loaded into memory. The data includes maximum hitpoints, damage multipliers,
    and destruction states for each destructible object in the world. This functionality
    supports World of Warcraft's building destruction mechanics where objects can
    be damaged and eventually destroyed based on combat interactions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadObjectMgr()\n{\n    ObjectMgr* mgr = ObjectMgr::Instance();\n\
      \    mgr->LoadDestructibleHitpoints(); // Load destructible object hitpoints\n\
      \    // Other initialization code...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations. It reads data from the 'gameobject_template' and related tables in
    the database. The loaded data is stored internally within the ObjectMgr singleton
    for fast access during gameplay. Performance considerations include potential
    database query overhead during large world object loads.
