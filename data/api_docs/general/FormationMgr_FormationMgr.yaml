  method: FormationMgr
  signature: void FormationMgr::FormationMgr(FormationMgr && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a FormationMgr object to another FormationMgr object using move semantics.
  description: The FormationMgr move constructor initializes a FormationMgr object
    by transferring ownership of resources from a temporary (rvalue) FormationMgr
    object. This operation is typically used in scenarios where a FormationMgr instance
    needs to be efficiently transferred between variables or returned from functions
    without unnecessary copying. The source object becomes invalid after the move
    operation and should not be used. This constructor is part of the standard C++
    move semantics implementation for the FormationMgr class, which manages formation
    data for creatures in the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another FormationMgr object whose resources
      will be moved to this instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'FormationMgr mgr1;

      // ... initialize mgr1 ...

      FormationMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Moves resources from mgr1 to mgr2

      // mgr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state and should not be used'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no user-defined
    move constructor exists. It performs a member-wise move of all data members. In
    TrinityCore's context, this is particularly relevant for managing formation data
    efficiently during creature AI initialization and transitions.
  warnings: After moving from an object, the source object enters a valid but unspecified
    state. Using it afterward may lead to undefined behavior or unexpected results.
    Ensure that no further operations are performed on the moved-from object.
