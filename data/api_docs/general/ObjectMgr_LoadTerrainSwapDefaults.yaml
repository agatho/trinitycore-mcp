  brief: Initializes default terrain swap data for all maps and zones in the game
    world.
  description: The LoadTerrainSwapDefaults method is responsible for loading and initializing
    default terrain swap configurations for all maps and zones within the TrinityCore
    server. This method ensures that each map has appropriate default terrain swap
    settings, which are used to modify the visual appearance of terrain based on player
    location or other conditions. It typically runs during server startup or map loading
    processes to ensure that all areas have valid terrain swap data available for
    runtime operations. The method does not require any external parameters and performs
    its operations internally using the core object manager system.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadTerrainSwapDefaults();\n    // Continue with\
      \ other initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or map loading phases.
    It may involve database queries to retrieve default terrain swap configurations
    for each zone. The method should be thread-safe as it's usually invoked during
    single-threaded initialization phases.
