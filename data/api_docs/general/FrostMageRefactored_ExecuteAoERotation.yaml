  class: FrostMageRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void FrostMageRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the frost mage's AoE spell rotation strategy based on enemy count
    and target selection.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a frost
    mage's area-of-effect combat rotation. It evaluates the current combat situation,
    including the number of enemies present and their targeting information, to determine
    the optimal sequence of spells to cast. The method typically prioritizes high-damage
    AoE abilities such as Frost Nova, Blizzard, or Ice Storm depending on the enemy
    density and game state. This function is designed to maximize damage output while
    maintaining resource efficiency and cooldown management in group or raid encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier for the
      primary focus of the rotation. In TrinityCore, this would typically correspond
      to a GameObject or Creature GUID.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the total number of enemies currently
      within the spell's effective range. This value determines which AoE spells are
      prioritized and how many targets can be hit simultaneously.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a combat scenario
    code: 'int mainTarget = 12345;

      uint32 enemies = 5;

      FrostMageRefactored frostMage;

      frostMage.ExecuteAoERotation(&mainTarget, enemies);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TrinityCore AI system
    code: "void FrostMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        Unit* target = me->GetVictim();\n        uint32 count = me->GetMap()->GetPlayersCountInGrid();\n\
      \        if (target && count > 0)\n        {\n            ExecuteAoERotation((int*)&target->GetGUID(),\
      \ count);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the frost mage is already in combat and has valid
    targets. The implementation should account for spell cooldowns, mana costs, and
    positioning requirements. It's recommended to call this function only when the
    AI has sufficient information about nearby enemies to make effective decisions.
  warnings: Do not invoke this method without ensuring that the target pointer points
    to a valid unit or object. Passing an invalid or null pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Additionally, calling this function outside of combat context
    might lead to incorrect spell selection and resource waste.
