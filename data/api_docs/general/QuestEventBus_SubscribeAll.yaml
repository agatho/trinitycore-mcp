  class: QuestEventBus
  method: SubscribeAll
  signature: bool QuestEventBus::SubscribeAll(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all quest events in the QuestEventBus.
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI instance to receive
    notifications for all quest-related events managed by the QuestEventBus. This
    allows the bot to react to various quest states such as quest acceptance, completion,
    failure, and other related triggers without needing to manually subscribe to each
    individual event. The method typically returns true if the subscription was successful,
    or false if the subscription failed due to invalid input or internal errors. This
    is commonly used in AI scripting for World of Warcraft bots to ensure comprehensive
    quest tracking and response behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAI subscriber was successfully registered for all
    quest events; returns false if registration failed, which may occur due to null
    pointer input or internal system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription of a BotAI
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = QuestEventBus::SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all quest events\n    printf(\"\
      Bot successfully subscribed to all quest events\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Subscription\
      \ failed\n    printf(\"Failed to subscribe bot to quest events\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the QuestEventBus is properly initialized and that
    the BotAI instance is valid. It may internally manage a list or map of subscribers,
    so repeated calls with the same BotAI pointer might result in duplicate entries
    unless handled by the internal implementation.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or system crashes.
    Also, be cautious about unsubscribing from events manually if using SubscribeAll,
    as it may affect how event handling is managed internally.
