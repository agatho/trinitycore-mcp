  class: TempSummon
  method: SetDontAutoResummon
  signature: void TempSummon::SetDontAutoResummon(bool dontAutoResummon)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the temporary summon should not automatically resume after being
    destroyed.
  description: The SetDontAutoResummon method controls the automatic resumption behavior
    of a temporary summon. When called with true, it prevents the summon from being
    automatically respawned when its current instance is destroyed or expires. This
    is commonly used for summons that are meant to be permanent or controlled by specific
    game logic rather than automatic respawning. The flag affects the summon's lifecycle
    and can be useful in quest scripting, boss encounters, or custom AI behaviors
    where automatic resummoning would interfere with intended gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: dontAutoResummon
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to disable auto-resummon behavior.
      When true, the summon will not automatically respawn; when false, it will follow
      normal auto-respawn rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable Auto-Resummon for a Temporary Summon
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = player->GetSummon();

      summon->SetDontAutoResummon(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Auto-Resummon Control Based on Quest State
    code: "if (player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n   \
      \ TempSummon* summon = player->GetSummon();\n    summon->SetDontAutoResummon(true);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    TempSummon* summon = player->GetSummon();\n    summon->SetDontAutoResummon(false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal flag that controls summon behavior.
    It's important to understand that this change persists until explicitly modified
    again, and affects all future summon events. The method should be called before
    the summon is destroyed or expires to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Setting dontAutoResummon to true will prevent any automatic respawning
    of the summon, which may break quest progression or encounter mechanics if not
    carefully considered. Always verify that disabling auto-resummon aligns with intended
    game flow and does not leave players in an unintended state.
