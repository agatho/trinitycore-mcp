  class: DamageInfo
  method: GetAbsorb
  signature: uint32 DamageInfo::GetAbsorb() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total amount of damage absorbed by the target during the damage
    event.
  description: The GetAbsorb method retrieves the cumulative absorb value applied
    to a damage instance, which represents the total amount of damage that was prevented
    or reduced through absorb effects such as spell shields, damage reduction auras,
    or other protective mechanisms. This value is typically set during the damage
    calculation phase and reflects all absorb effects that were active when the damage
    was processed. The returned value indicates how much of the original damage was
    nullified by these protective measures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total amount of damage that was absorbed
    during this damage event. Returns 0 if no absorption occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Absorbed Damage
    code: "DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();\nuint32 absorbed = damageInfo->GetAbsorb();\n\
      if (absorbed > 0)\n{\n    // Handle absorbed damage logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Damage was partially absorbed: %u\", absorbed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Absorb Value in Damage Calculation
    code: "void ApplyDamage(Unit* target, uint32 originalDamage)\n{\n    DamageInfo\
      \ damageInfo;\n    // ... set up damage info ...\n    uint32 absorbed = damageInfo.GetAbsorb();\n\
      \    uint32 finalDamage = originalDamage - absorbed;\n    target->DealDamage(nullptr,\
      \ finalDamage, DOT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the damage event has been fully processed
    and all absorb effects have been applied. The value returned is immutable once
    the damage calculation is complete and reflects the final absorbed amount for
    that specific damage instance.
  warnings: Do not call this method before the damage has been fully calculated, as
    it may return incorrect or uninitialized values. Ensure that any absorb effects
    are properly applied to the DamageInfo object prior to calling this method.
