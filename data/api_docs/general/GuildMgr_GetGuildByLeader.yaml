  signature: Guild * GuildMgr::GetGuildByLeader(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a guild object by the GUID of its leader.
  description: The GetGuildByLeader method searches through all registered guilds
    in the server's guild manager to find and return the guild whose leader has the
    specified GUID. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore
    environments to locate a player's guild based on their leadership status. The
    method performs a linear search through the internal guild list, making it relatively
    efficient for small to medium-sized servers but potentially slower on large servers
    with many guilds. It returns a pointer to the Guild object if found, or nullptr
    if no guild exists with a leader matching the provided GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is the leader of the
      desired guild. This should be a valid player GUID from the game's database.
  returns: A pointer to the Guild object if a guild with the specified leader GUID
    exists; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching guild is found.
  examples:
  - title: Find Guild by Leader GUID
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildByLeader(12345);\nif (guild)\n{\n   \
      \ std::cout << \"Found guild: \" << guild->GetName() << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"No guild found with this leader.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that each guild has exactly one leader. The implementation
    relies on the internal data structures of GuildMgr, which are typically populated
    during server startup or when guilds are created/modified. It is recommended to
    check for nullptr before using the returned pointer to avoid potential crashes.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical sections of
    code due to its linear search nature. Avoid calling it repeatedly in tight loops
    without caching results. Also, ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an
    actual player who is currently a guild leader; otherwise, the method will return
    nullptr.
