documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the WaypointMovementFactory class for managing
    NPC waypoint movement behaviors.
  description: The WaypointMovementFactory constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for creating and handling waypoint-based movement
    patterns for NPCs in TrinityCore. This factory pattern implementation allows for
    the creation of various waypoint movement types, including linear paths, circular
    routes, and custom-defined trajectories. The constructor sets up default configurations
    and prepares the factory to generate movement behaviors that can be attached to
    creatures for automated path following. It ensures proper initialization of any
    internal tracking mechanisms needed for waypoint progression and event handling
    during NPC movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic WaypointMovementFactory Initialization
    code: 'WaypointMovementFactory factory;

      // The factory is now ready to create waypoint movement behaviors

      Creature* npc = ...; // Some NPC in the world

      factory.CreateMovement(npc);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any actual movement setup on NPCs. It only
    initializes the factory object itself. The actual creation of waypoint movements
    requires calling other methods from this class, such as CreateMovement or similar
    factory methods. The factory maintains internal state that should be preserved
    across multiple movement creations.
