documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has all required prerequisites to start a quest.
  description: The HasQuestPrerequisites method evaluates whether a player meets all
    necessary conditions to begin a specific quest. This includes checking for completed
    prerequisite quests, sufficient level requirements, required items in the player's
    inventory, and any other quest-specific conditions defined in the game data. The
    method is typically called before offering a quest to the player to ensure they
    are eligible to accept it. It does not modify the player's quest state or progress;
    it only performs validation checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all prerequisites for the quest are met by the player,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that one or more conditions
    prevent the player from starting the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest acceptance logic
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager().HasQuestPrerequisites(quest)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot accept the quest due to missing prerequisites\n    SendQuestFailedMessage(quest);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple checks including quest completion status, level
    requirements, and item possession. It's commonly used in conjunction with other
    quest-related methods like GetQuestStatus() or CanTakeQuest(). The performance
    impact is generally low since it only validates conditions without modifying game
    state.
