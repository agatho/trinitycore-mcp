  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ExperimentResult class with default values.
  description: The ExperimentResult constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ExperimentResult class. This method sets up the internal state of the object to
    its default configuration, ensuring that all member variables are properly initialized
    before use. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this
    constructor likely prepares the object for storing experiment-related data or
    results, such as those used in game mechanics, testing, or player interaction
    systems. The method does not accept any parameters and performs no complex operations
    beyond basic initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ExperimentResult instance
    code: 'ExperimentResult result;

      // The result object is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when declaring a local
    variable or creating an object on the stack. Developers should be aware that this
    method only performs basic initialization and does not populate any experiment-specific
    data. Additional setup methods may be required to configure the object for actual
    use.
