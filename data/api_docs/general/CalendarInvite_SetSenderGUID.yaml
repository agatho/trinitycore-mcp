documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the player who sent the calendar invite
  description: The SetSenderGUID method assigns the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    player who created or sent a calendar invitation. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore server to track which player initiated a calendar event invite.
    The GUID is typically obtained from the player's object instance and represents
    a persistent identifier within the game world. This method does not perform any
    validation on the provided GUID value, so it should be used with a valid player
    GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the calendar
      invite. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from player objects within
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting sender GUID for a calendar invite
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      Player* sender = ...; // Get reference to the sending player

      invite->SetSenderGUID(sender->GetGUID().GetCounter());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the calendar system implementation in TrinityCore
    and is typically called during invite creation. The GUID parameter should correspond
    to a valid player object in the game world, otherwise the invite may not function
    correctly.
