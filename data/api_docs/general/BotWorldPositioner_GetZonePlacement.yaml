  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: GetZonePlacement
  signature: const ZonePlacement * BotWorldPositioner::GetZonePlacement(uint32 zoneId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the zone placement data for a specified zone ID.
  description: The GetZonePlacement method retrieves a const pointer to a ZonePlacement
    object associated with the given zone ID. This method is typically used in the
    context of bot AI behavior and world positioning logic within TrinityCore's framework.
    It allows access to predefined placement rules, such as spawn points or movement
    constraints, for specific zones. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call from multiple threads if the underlying data structure is
    properly synchronized. The returned pointer may be null if no zone placement data
    exists for the specified zone ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a ZonePlacement object corresponding to the specified
    zone ID, or nullptr if no such zone placement data exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const ZonePlacement* placement = positioner->GetZonePlacement(1234);\n\
      if (placement)\n{\n    // Use the placement data\n    printf(\"Zone %u has %u\
      \ spawn points\\n\", 1234, placement->SpawnPoints.size());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotWorldPositioner class which manages AI bot
    positioning and movement in various zones. The ZonePlacement objects are typically
    loaded from configuration files or database entries at startup and remain constant
    during runtime.
