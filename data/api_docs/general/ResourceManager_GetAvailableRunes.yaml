  signature: uint32 ResourceManager::GetAvailableRunes(uint8 runeType)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of available runes of the specified type for the player
  description: The GetAvailableRunes method retrieves the count of usable runes for
    a specific rune type (such as Blood, Unholy, Frost, or Death) that are currently
    available to the player. This method is typically used in the context of World
    of Warcraft's Death Knight class mechanics, where players accumulate runes over
    time and can consume them to cast spells. The returned value represents how many
    runes of the given type can be used immediately without waiting for regeneration.
  parameters:
  - name: runeType
    description: The type of rune to query. Valid values are 0 (Blood), 1 (Frost),
      2 (Unholy), and 3 (Death).
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the number of available runes of the specified
    type. Returns 0 if no runes of that type are available or if an invalid runeType
    is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Blood Runes
    code: "uint32 bloodRunes = player->GetResource()->GetAvailableRunes(0); // 0 for\
      \ Blood runes\nif (bloodRunes > 0)\n{\n    // Player has available Blood runes\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine Total Available Runes
    code: "uint32 totalRunes = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)\n{\n    totalRunes\
      \ += player->GetResource()->GetAvailableRunes(i);\n}\n// totalRunes now contains\
      \ the sum of all available runes"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ResourceManager class which handles resource management
    for players, particularly Death Knights. It's important to note that rune availability
    is tied to the player's current rune regeneration state and cooldowns. The method
    does not account for runes that are currently on cooldown or in the process of
    regenerating.
  warnings: Ensure that the runeType parameter is within valid range (0-3) otherwise
    behavior is undefined. This method should be called only when the player has a
    valid ResourceManager instance, typically associated with Death Knight characters.
