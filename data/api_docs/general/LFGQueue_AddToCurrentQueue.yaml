  class: LFGQueue
  method: AddToCurrentQueue
  signature: void LFGQueue::AddToCurrentQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the current LFG queue based on their GUID.
  description: The AddToCurrentQueue method is responsible for inserting a player
    into the current Looking For Group (LFG) queue using their unique identifier (GUID).
    This method is typically invoked when a player expresses interest in joining an
    LFG group, and it ensures that the player's information is properly registered
    within the LFG system. The method operates on the current queue context and does
    not return any value. It is part of the core LFG queue management functionality
    in TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to the LFG
      queue. This should be a valid player GUID that corresponds to an active character
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Player to LFG Queue
    code: "uint64 playerGUID = 123456789ULL;\nLFGQueue* queue = sLFGMgr->GetQueue(playerGUID);\n\
      if (queue)\n{\n    queue->AddToCurrentQueue(playerGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LFG queue instance is properly initialized and
    accessible. The GUID parameter must be validated before calling this method to
    ensure it refers to an existing player. The method does not perform any validation
    on the player's eligibility or group requirements.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all GUIDs passed to this method are verified
    and correspond to valid players in the game world.
