api:
  class: MovementAction
  method: SetFormation
  signature: void MovementAction::SetFormation(uint32 formation)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation type for a movement action.
  description: The SetFormation method configures the formation type that a MovementAction
    will use during execution. This is typically used in AI behavior scripting to
    define how units should move in relation to each other, such as in a line, circle,
    or group formation. The method accepts a formation ID which corresponds to predefined
    formation types within the TrinityCore framework. This setting affects subsequent
    movement operations and may influence pathfinding and positioning logic for the
    associated unit or group.
  parameters:
  - name: formation
    description: A uint32 value representing the formation type to be set. Valid values
      correspond to predefined formation IDs in the TrinityCore system, such as LINE_FORMATION
      (1), CIRCLE_FORMATION (2), or GROUP_FORMATION (3).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Line Formation
    code: 'MovementAction* action = new MovementAction();

      action->SetFormation(1); // LINE_FORMATION

      // Subsequent movement will follow line formation rules'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Formation Change During Combat
    code: "if (enemyCount > 5)\n{\n    action->SetFormation(2); // CIRCLE_FORMATION\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    action->SetFormation(1); // LINE_FORMATION\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately affect current movement; it sets the formation
    for future movement operations. The actual application of formation logic depends
    on the AI implementation and may involve pathfinding calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the formation ID passed is valid and supported by the TrinityCore
    version being used, as invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or default formation
    settings.
