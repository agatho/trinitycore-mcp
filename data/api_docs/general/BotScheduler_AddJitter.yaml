  method: AddJitter
  signature: int BotScheduler::AddJitter(int time, uint32 jitterMinutes) const
documentation:
  brief: Adds random jitter time to a given time value in minutes
  description: The AddJitter method introduces a randomized delay to a specified time
    value, measured in minutes. This is commonly used in bot scheduling to prevent
    synchronized behavior and add natural variation to AI actions. The method takes
    an initial time value and adds a random jitter within the specified range (up
    to jitterMinutes) to create more realistic timing patterns. The returned value
    represents the adjusted time with added randomness.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: The base time value in minutes to which jitter will be added
  - name: jitterMinutes
    description: The maximum amount of random minutes to add as jitter (0 means no
      jitter)
  returns: Returns the original time value plus a random jitter between 0 and jitterMinutes
    (inclusive). The result represents the adjusted time with added randomness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with 5-minute jitter
    code: int scheduledTime = scheduler.AddJitter(30, 5); // Returns value between
      30-35 minutes
    language: cpp
  - title: Using jitter for bot action timing
    code: uint32 botActionDelay = scheduler.AddJitter(60, 10); // Random delay between
      60-70 minutes
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI scheduling systems to prevent bots from
    performing actions at perfectly synchronized intervals. The jitter is applied
    using a random distribution that ensures natural variation in timing patterns.
  warnings: The method uses a const qualifier, meaning it does not modify internal
    state but may rely on random number generation which could affect reproducibility
    in testing scenarios.
