  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: StartPerformanceTimer
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::StartPerformanceTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Starts a performance timer for behavior execution tracking within the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
  description: The StartPerformanceTimer method initializes a high-resolution performance
    monitoring timer within the AdvancedBehaviorManager class. This timer is used
    to measure the execution time of AI behaviors and decision-making processes, enabling
    performance profiling and optimization. The method typically sets up internal
    timing variables or starts a stopwatch that can be later queried using related
    methods such as GetPerformanceTime(). It's commonly invoked at the beginning of
    behavior execution cycles to accurately capture how long specific AI operations
    take to complete. This functionality is crucial for maintaining optimal server
    performance in World of Warcraft environments where excessive CPU usage by AI
    systems can impact overall game responsiveness.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    // Start performance monitoring\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->StartPerformanceTimer();\n\
      \    \n    // Execute AI behavior logic here\n    DoSomethingComplex();\n  \
      \  \n    // Timer continues running until explicitly stopped or reset\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other performance measurement
    methods within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. The timer may use high-resolution
    performance counters available on the system, which are more accurate than standard
    time functions for profiling purposes. It's recommended to call this method before
    any AI behavior execution that needs to be measured.
