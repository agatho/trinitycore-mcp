  signature: void InstanceScript::DoRespawnGameObject(int guid, int timeToDespawn)
documentation:
  brief: Respawns a game object with the specified GUID after a given time delay.
  description: The DoRespawnGameObject method is used in TrinityCore's InstanceScript
    to respawn a specific game object identified by its GUID. This method allows for
    controlled respawning of objects such as doors, chests, or other interactive elements
    within an instance. The object will be destroyed and then recreated after the
    specified time interval. This functionality is commonly used in scripted encounters
    where certain objects need to reset their state or become available again after
    a period. The method operates on the game object's GUID and a time delay in seconds.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object to respawn. This
      is typically obtained from the object's GetGUID() method or through database
      queries.
  - name: timeToDespawn
    description: The time in seconds after which the game object should be respawned.
      A value of 0 means immediate respawning, while positive values indicate a delay
      before respawning occurs.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void instance_example::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    // Respawn\
      \ a door with GUID 12345 after 30 seconds\n    DoRespawnGameObject(12345, 30);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Immediate Respawn Example
    code: "void instance_example::OnEncounterEnd()\n{\n    // Immediately respawn\
      \ all chests in the instance\n    DoRespawnGameObject(54321, 0);\n    DoRespawnGameObject(54322,\
      \ 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method works only with game objects that are managed by the instance
    script. The GUID must refer to a valid game object within the current instance
    context. The respawn process is handled asynchronously by the server's game object
    management system.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to an existing game object in
    the instance, otherwise the method may silently fail. Be cautious with very short
    time delays as they might cause issues with object state transitions or client
    synchronization.
