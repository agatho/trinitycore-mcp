  method: GetSpawnMetadataForGroup
  signature: int ObjectMgr::GetSpawnMetadataForGroup(uint32 groupId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spawn metadata value associated with a specified group ID.
  description: The GetSpawnMetadataForGroup method retrieves the spawn metadata integer
    value linked to a given group identifier within the ObjectMgr system. This functionality
    is typically used in TrinityCore's world object management to determine specific
    properties or behaviors related to how game entities (creatures, game objects)
    are spawned in the world based on their group definitions. The method performs
    a lookup in internal data structures that map group IDs to metadata values, which
    may influence spawning logic such as respawn times, spawn conditions, or other
    behavioral flags. It is important to note that this method assumes the group ID
    exists and has associated metadata; otherwise, it may return a default or invalid
    value depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the spawn metadata value for the specified
    group ID. If no metadata is found for the given group ID, the method may return
    a default value (such as 0) or trigger an error condition based on internal validation
    logic.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spawn Metadata for Group
    code: "int metadata = sObjectMgr->GetSpawnMetadataForGroup(12345);\nif (metadata\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the retrieved metadata\n    printf(\"Spawn metadata\
      \ for group 12345 is: %d\\n\", metadata);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where\
      \ no metadata exists or error occurred\n    printf(\"No valid spawn metadata\
      \ found for group 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal lookup system that maps group identifiers
    to metadata configurations used during object spawning. It should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections due to potential map lookups. The returned integer
    may represent various flags or configuration values depending on how the metadata
    is defined and interpreted by the core systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId parameter passed to this method corresponds to
    an existing group definition; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or return invalid
    data. This method does not validate whether the group ID exists in the database,
    so calling code should ensure proper initialization of spawn groups before invoking
    it.
