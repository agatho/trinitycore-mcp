  class: UpdateTimeHistogram
  method: GetMedian
  signature: uint32 UpdateTimeHistogram::GetMedian() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the median update time from the histogram data.
  description: The GetMedian method computes the median value of all recorded update
    times stored within the UpdateTimeHistogram instance. This statistical measure
    represents the middle value when all recorded times are sorted in ascending order.
    The method is typically used for performance monitoring and analysis, helping
    developers understand typical update latencies in the game loop or subsystems.
    It assumes that the histogram has been populated with sufficient data points to
    provide a meaningful median calculation. The returned value is expressed in milliseconds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the median update time in milliseconds. If
    no data points are available, the method may return 0 or an undefined value depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Performance Monitoring
    code: 'UpdateTimeHistogram histogram;

      // ... populate histogram with update times ...

      uint32 medianTime = histogram.GetMedian();

      std::cout << "Median update time: " << medianTime << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the internal data structure to be sorted or maintained
    in a way that allows efficient median calculation. Performance may vary depending
    on how many data points are stored and whether the histogram supports fast access
    to middle elements.
