  signature: void GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildMetrics(uint32 playerGuid, GuildActivityType
    activity, bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Updates guild metrics based on player activity and success status
  description: The UpdateGuildMetrics method records and processes player activities
    within a guild context, updating internal guild statistics and performance indicators.
    This method is typically invoked when a player completes a guild-related activity
    such as completing a quest, participating in a raid, or achieving a milestone.
    It tracks whether the activity was successful and updates relevant metrics accordingly.
    The method does not return any value but modifies internal guild state that may
    be used for guild rankings, rewards, or performance tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose activity is being
      recorded. This must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: activity
    description: An enumeration value representing the type of guild activity performed
      by the player. Valid values include quest completion, raid participation, achievement
      unlocking, and other defined guild activities.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the player's guild activity was
      successful. True indicates success, false indicates failure or partial success.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildMetrics(123456, GUILD_ACTIVITY_QUEST_COMPLETE,
      true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Failed Activity
    code: GuildIntegration::UpdateGuildMetrics(789012, GUILD_ACTIVITY_RAID_PARTICIPATION,
      false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild data structures and may
    trigger updates to guild leaderboards or performance indicators. It should be
    called only when a player's activity is confirmed to have occurred within the
    game world.
  warnings: Ensure that playerGuid corresponds to an actual online player, as invalid
    GUIDs may cause undefined behavior or errors in the metrics system. The activity
    parameter must match predefined values to avoid incorrect metric updates.
