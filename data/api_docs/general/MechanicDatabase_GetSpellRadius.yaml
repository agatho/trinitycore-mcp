documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the radius of a spell's effect from the mechanic database by its
    unique identifier.
  description: The GetSpellRadius method fetches the radius value associated with
    a specific spell ID from the mechanic database. This radius typically defines
    the area of effect for spells such as AoE (Area of Effect) abilities, determining
    how far the spell's influence extends from its center point. The method is commonly
    used in spell processing and game mechanics to calculate hit detection, damage
    application, or visual effects. It assumes that the spell ID corresponds to a
    valid entry in the database; otherwise, it may return a default or zero value
    depending on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the radius of the spell's effect. If no matching
    spell is found, the method may return 0.0f or another default value indicating
    an invalid or undefined radius.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell Radius for Fireball
    code: "float radius = mechanicDatabase.GetSpellRadius(133);\n// Returns the radius\
      \ of the Fireball spell (ID 133)\nif (radius > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the radius\
      \ for area calculation or effect rendering\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a caching system within the mechanic database,
    so repeated calls with the same spell ID may be optimized. Ensure that the spell
    ID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual spell in the game's database to
    avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid or non-existent spell IDs might lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect radius values. Always validate input IDs before calling this method
    if strict error handling is required.
