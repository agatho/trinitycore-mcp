  signature: uint8 TargetScanner::GetTargetPriority(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the priority level of a target unit for AI decision-making
    purposes.
  description: The GetTargetPriority method evaluates a given Unit target and assigns
    it a priority value used by the AI system to determine which target to attack
    or focus on. This priority is typically based on factors such as threat level,
    distance, target type (player vs. creature), and other combat-related attributes.
    The returned uint8 value represents a relative ranking where higher values indicate
    higher priority targets. This method is commonly used within target selection
    logic for mobs and NPCs in TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the target's priority level, with higher
    values indicating higher priority targets. The exact scale and interpretation
    may vary based on implementation details of the AI system, but typically ranges
    from 0 (lowest priority) to 255 (highest priority).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI target selection
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nuint8 priority = scanner.GetTargetPriority(target);\n\
      if (priority > 100)\n{\n    // Target is considered high priority\n    ai->Attack(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TargetScanner class which is used extensively
    in TrinityCore's AI system for target selection. The implementation likely considers
    multiple factors such as threat generated, distance from caster, target health,
    and faction relationships to compute priority values.
