api:
  class: BfGraveyard
  method: GetGraveyardId
  signature: int BfGraveyard::GetGraveyardId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the graveyard associated with this Battlefield
    Graveyard object.
  description: The GetGraveyardId method returns the integer identifier that uniquely
    represents a specific graveyard within the context of a battlefield. This ID is
    used internally by the TrinityCore framework to associate players with their respective
    graveyard locations during battlefield events such as Warsong Gulch or Arathi
    Basin. The returned value corresponds to the graveyard's entry in the game's database
    and is essential for proper player resurrection mechanics during battlegrounds.
    This method does not perform any validation or transformation of the ID; it simply
    returns the stored identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique graveyard identifier (GUID) used by
    the TrinityCore battleground system to reference this specific graveyard location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BfGraveyard* graveyard = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      int id = graveyard->GetGraveyardId();

      printf("Graveyard ID: %d\n", id);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Battlefield Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerDeath(Player* player, BfGraveyard* graveyard)\n{\n   \
      \ int graveyardId = graveyard->GetGraveyardId();\n    // Use graveyardId to\
      \ determine where the player should be resurrected\n    player->SetDeathState(DEATH_STATE_GHOST);\n\
      \    player->SetGhostTime(time(NULL));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battlefield initialization and player
    movement events. The returned ID directly maps to the graveyard_template table
    in the database where each graveyard has a unique entry. It's important to note
    that this ID may be zero or negative if the graveyard hasn't been properly initialized
    or assigned.
  warnings: Do not assume that all returned IDs are valid or correspond to existing
    graveyards. Always validate the ID against the game's graveyard data before using
    it in critical operations such as player resurrection. Also, be aware that this
    method returns a const value and should not be used to modify internal state.
