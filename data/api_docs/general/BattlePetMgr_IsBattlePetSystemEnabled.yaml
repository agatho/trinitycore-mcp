  class: BattlePetMgr
  method: IsBattlePetSystemEnabled
  signature: bool BattlePetMgr::IsBattlePetSystemEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Battle Pet system is enabled in the current TrinityCore
    instance.
  description: The IsBattlePetSystemEnabled method checks if the Battle Pet system
    has been activated within the game world. This functionality is typically controlled
    by a server configuration setting or game rule that can be toggled on or off.
    The method returns true if battle pets are fully functional and available for
    use, including pet battles, collection, and related gameplay mechanics. It serves
    as a global switch to disable or enable all Battle Pet features across the entire
    realm. This check is often used before allowing players to interact with battle
    pets or access pet-related interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Battle Pet system is enabled; otherwise returns false
    when the system is disabled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (battlePetMgr->IsBattlePetSystemEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with battle\
      \ pet operations\n    player->SendPetBattleUpdate();\n} else {\n    // Inform\
      \ player that battle pets are not available\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Battle Pets are currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from a server configuration flag or database setting
    rather than performing complex runtime checks. It's recommended to cache this
    value if it's checked frequently during gameplay loops, as accessing configuration
    flags may have minor performance overhead.
