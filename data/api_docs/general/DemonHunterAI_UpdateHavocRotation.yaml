  method: UpdateHavocRotation
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdateHavocRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the havoc rotation logic for a demon hunter AI, determining the next
    ability to cast based on current game state and target.
  description: The UpdateHavocRotation method is responsible for managing the core
    combat decision-making process for a Demon Hunter using the Havoc specialization
    in TrinityCore. This method evaluates the current state of the player, including
    available resources such as Fury, target health, and cooldowns, to determine the
    optimal ability to cast next. It integrates with the overall AI framework to ensure
    that the demon hunter follows a strategic rotation that maximizes damage output
    while respecting game mechanics like resource management and spell priorities.
    The method typically operates within a loop or periodic update cycle, making real-time
    decisions based on dynamic battlefield conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index in the
      game world. This parameter allows the AI to identify and interact with specific
      enemies during combat.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateHavocRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target <= 0) return;\n    // Logic to determine next ability based on\
      \ target and player state\n    // Implementation details would go here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateHavocRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    Unit* unit = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*this,\
      \ *target);\n    if (!unit || !unit->IsAlive()) return;\n    \n    // Evaluate\
      \ current Fury and target health\n    // Determine next ability based on Havoc\
      \ rotation rules\n    // Execute the chosen ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI system that must be carefully integrated
    with other components like threat management, cooldown tracking, and resource
    allocation. The method assumes that the target pointer points to a valid game
    object ID, and it's recommended to validate this before proceeding. Performance
    considerations include minimizing expensive operations within the update loop
    to maintain smooth gameplay.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to null pointer dereferences
    or incorrect behavior. Always validate input parameters before using them in logic
    calculations. Additionally, since this method is part of an AI system, changes
    to its logic may significantly impact gameplay balance and should be thoroughly
    tested.
