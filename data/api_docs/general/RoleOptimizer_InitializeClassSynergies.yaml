documentation:
  brief: Initializes class synergies for role optimization within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The InitializeClassSynergies method sets up internal data structures
    and configurations required for determining optimal class combinations and role
    assignments in group scenarios. This method is typically invoked during system
    initialization or when a new player joins a group, ensuring that all class-specific
    synergy rules are properly loaded and ready for use. It establishes relationships
    between different classes and their compatibility for various roles such as tank,
    healer, and damage dealer, which is essential for the RoleOptimizer to make informed
    decisions about party composition and role distribution.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeClassSynergies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the system's initialization
    phase to avoid redundant operations. It is thread-safe and does not require any
    external dependencies beyond standard TrinityCore libraries.
