documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall decision score for a bot AI based on configured
    weights and criteria.
  description: The CalculateOverallScore method computes a weighted aggregate score
    that represents the bot's overall decision quality or fitness within the AI decision
    framework. This score is typically derived from multiple individual component
    scores (such as threat assessment, target priority, resource availability, etc.)
    multiplied by their respective weight factors defined in the AI profile. The resulting
    double value serves as a comparative metric for selecting the best action among
    possible decisions. The method does not modify any internal state and is designed
    to be called during decision-making cycles when evaluating potential bot behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double precision floating-point number representing the calculated overall
    AI decision score. Higher values typically indicate better decision quality or
    higher priority for execution, though exact interpretation depends on how weights
    and scoring criteria are configured within the BotAIDecisionProfile instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Context
    code: "BotAIDecisionProfile profile;\n// Assume profile is initialized with weights\
      \ and criteria\nconst double score = profile.CalculateOverallScore();\nif (score\
      \ > 0.8)\n{\n    // Execute high-priority action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Multiple Profiles for Decision Making
    code: "BotAIDecisionProfile profile1, profile2;\n// Configure both profiles with\
      \ different strategies\nconst double score1 = profile1.CalculateOverallScore();\n\
      const double score2 = profile2.CalculateOverallScore();\nif (score1 > score2)\n\
      {\n    // Choose actions from profile1\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Choose actions from\
      \ profile2\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs no side effects and is thread-safe for read-only access
    to the decision profile. It assumes that all component scores and weights have
    been properly initialized before calling. The score calculation may involve floating-point
    arithmetic, so results should be compared using appropriate tolerance values rather
    than direct equality checks.
  warnings: Do not assume that a higher score always means a better action in all
    contexts; scoring logic is context-dependent. If profile components or weights
    are not properly configured, the returned score may be meaningless or misleading.
    Avoid calling this method in performance-critical sections without considering
    potential floating-point precision issues.
