  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: ApplyTracking
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::ApplyTracking(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Applies tracking mechanics to the hunter's current target.
  description: The ApplyTracking method activates the hunter's tracking ability, which
    allows the player to track a target's movement and location within the game world.
    This method typically modifies the hunter's behavior to maintain awareness of
    their target's position, often used in conjunction with other survival hunter
    abilities such as Feign Death or Misdirection. The implementation likely involves
    updating internal tracking state variables and potentially triggering visual or
    auditory feedback to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The target identifier or tracking parameter that specifies which
      entity to track. This is typically a unit GUID or similar identifier used by
      the TrinityCore framework to reference specific game objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tracking Application
    code: "void ApplyTracking(uint32 targetGuid) {\n    // Implementation would set\
      \ up tracking for the specified target\n    if (Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ targetGuid)) {\n        // Enable tracking logic for this target\n       \
      \ me->SetTarget(targetGuid);\n        // Update tracking state\n        m_trackingTarget\
      \ = target;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that governs survival hunter
    behavior. It may interact with other tracking-related systems such as cooldown
    management or resource consumption. The method should only be called when the
    hunter has a valid target to track.
  warnings: Calling this method without a proper target GUID can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target exists and is valid before invoking
    this method.
