    & group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a target should be focused based on group and unit criteria
  description: The ShouldFocusTarget method evaluates if a given unit target meets
    specific conditions to be considered for focus targeting within a defined group
    context. This utility function is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    where the system must determine optimal target selection for player characters
    or NPCs. The method considers both the target's properties and the group assignment
    to make this determination. It is commonly employed in combat scenarios to prioritize
    targets based on threat level, proximity, or other strategic factors relevant
    to group dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the potential target to
      evaluate for focus. This parameter cannot be null and must point to a valid
      game unit instance.
  - name: group
    description: Integer value representing the group identifier or context in which
      the target evaluation occurs. This typically corresponds to a player's group
      assignment or role within a raid/party structure.
  returns: Returns true if the target meets the focus criteria for the specified group,
    otherwise returns false. The decision is based on internal logic that evaluates
    target properties against group-specific rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "if (TargetSelectionUtils::ShouldFocusTarget(targetUnit, playerGroup)) {\n\
      \    // Execute focus targeting logic\n    player->SetTarget(targetUnit->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group-based targeting system
    code: "bool focusTarget = TargetSelectionUtils::ShouldFocusTarget(enemy, currentPlayer->GetGroup()->GetId());\n\
      if (focusTarget && !currentPlayer->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n   \
      \ // Initiate focused attack on target\n    currentPlayer->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FOCUS_ATTACK, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger targeting system and may interact
    with other utility functions to determine overall target priority. The implementation
    details depend on the specific rules defined for group-based focus targeting in
    TrinityCore's AI framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The group parameter
    should represent a valid group context to avoid incorrect targeting decisions.
