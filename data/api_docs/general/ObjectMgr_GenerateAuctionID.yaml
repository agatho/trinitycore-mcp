documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique identifier for a new auction item in the auction house
    system
  description: The GenerateAuctionID method is responsible for creating a unique 32-bit
    identifier for each new auction item added to the auction house. This identifier
    is used internally by TrinityCore to track and manage auction listings, ensuring
    no two auctions share the same ID. The method typically increments an internal
    counter or retrieves the next available ID from a database sequence, maintaining
    uniqueness across all active and pending auctions in the game world. It's commonly
    called when a player places an item up for auction through the auction house interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer representing the new auction identifier
    that can be used to reference the auction in database operations and game logic.
    The returned value is guaranteed to be non-zero and unique within the current
    auction house context.
  examples:
  - title: Generating an Auction ID for a New Listing
    code: 'uint32 auctionId = sObjectMgr->GenerateAuctionID();

      AuctionEntry* auction = new AuctionEntry();

      auction->id = auctionId;

      auction->itemTemplate = itemTemplate;

      sAuctionMgr->AddAuction(auction);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and should be called before creating any new auction
    entry. The generated IDs are typically stored in the `auction` table of the database
    with the 'id' field. The implementation likely uses atomic operations or database
    transactions to ensure ID uniqueness across multiple concurrent server instances.
  warnings: Do not call this method without proper synchronization if you're managing
    auctions from multiple threads, as it could lead to duplicate IDs. Also, never
    assume that returned auction IDs are sequential - they may be generated using
    a random or hash-based approach for security and anti-exploitation purposes.
