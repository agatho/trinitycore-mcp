documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the MistweaverSoothingMistTracker class.
  description: The MistweaverSoothingMistTracker constructor initializes all internal
    state variables and prepares the tracker for monitoring Soothing Mist effects
    applied by Mistweaver monks. This includes setting up tracking structures for
    active mist applications, initializing cooldown timers, and preparing data structures
    to store information about affected targets and their healing contributions. The
    tracker is designed to integrate with TrinityCore's spell system and combat log
    mechanisms to accurately monitor the duration and effectiveness of Soothing Mist.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Creating a new MistweaverSoothingMistTracker instance
    code: 'MistweaverSoothingMistTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track Soothing Mist effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing a new tracker instance.
    It does not perform any active tracking or monitoring of Soothing Mist effects;
    that functionality is provided by other methods in the class such as Update()
    or HandleSpellCast(). The internal data structures are initialized to default
    values and will be populated during gameplay events.
