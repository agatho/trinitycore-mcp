documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one CombatManager object to another, performing a
    deep copy of all combat-related data and state.
  description: The operator= method implements the assignment operator for the CombatManager
    class. It performs a deep copy of all combat-related data and state from the source
    CombatManager object to the target object. This includes copying active combatants,
    combat timers, damage records, and any other internal combat state information.
    The method ensures that after assignment, both objects maintain independent copies
    of the combat data, preventing unintended side effects when modifying either object.
    This is particularly important in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment
    where combat systems must maintain thread safety and data integrity across multiple
    concurrent game sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source CombatManager object whose contents will be copied to
      this object
  returns: A reference to the current CombatManager object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'CombatManager manager1;

      CombatManager manager2;

      // ... populate manager1 with combat data ...

      manager2 = manager1; // Assigns all combat state from manager1 to manager2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'CombatManager manager1, manager2, manager3;

      // ... populate managers with combat data ...

      manager3 = manager2 = manager1; // Chained assignment - all managers get the
      same combat state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a deep copy operation which may have performance implications
    when dealing with large combat datasets. The implementation should properly handle
    memory management to prevent memory leaks or dangling pointers. In TrinityCore's
    multi-threaded environment, this operator should be used carefully in concurrent
    contexts to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning CombatManager objects that contain active combat
    sessions, as the copied state may include time-sensitive data such as combat timers
    and damage over time effects. Ensure proper synchronization if using this operator
    in multi-threaded scenarios.
