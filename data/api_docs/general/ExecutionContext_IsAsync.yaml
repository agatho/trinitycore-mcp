  signature: bool ExecutionContext::IsAsync() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current execution context is asynchronous.
  description: The IsAsync method checks if the current ExecutionContext was created
    in an asynchronous context, which typically indicates that the operation is not
    blocking the main thread. This is commonly used in TrinityCore's event handling
    and database query systems to determine how to process requests. When true, operations
    may be queued or handled by background threads rather than executed immediately
    on the calling thread.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the execution context is asynchronous (i.e., non-blocking),
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the current operation should be treated
    as part of an async processing pipeline.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check async context
    code: "if (context.IsAsync()) {\n    // Handle asynchronous operation\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      world\", \"Executing in async context\");\n} else {\n    // Handle synchronous\
      \ operation\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Executing in sync context\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by TrinityCore's core systems to
    route operations appropriately. It's important for developers implementing custom
    hooks or database queries to understand the execution context to avoid potential
    deadlocks or performance issues.
