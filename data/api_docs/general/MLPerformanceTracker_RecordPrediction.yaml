  class: MLPerformanceTracker
  method: RecordPrediction
  signature: void MLPerformanceTracker::RecordPrediction(uint32_t botGuid, bool correct)
documentation:
  brief: Records a machine learning prediction result for a specific bot, tracking
    whether the prediction was correct or not.
  description: The RecordPrediction method logs the outcome of a machine learning
    model's prediction for a given bot identified by its GUID. This function is used
    to collect data on prediction accuracy, which can be utilized for performance
    analysis, model refinement, and improving AI behavior in the game. The method
    stores whether the prediction was correct (true) or incorrect (false), allowing
    for statistical tracking over time. It is typically invoked after a bot has made
    a decision based on ML inference, and the actual outcome of that decision is known.
    This data collection mechanism supports continuous learning and optimization of
    AI systems within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the prediction
      result is being recorded. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity in
      the game world.
  - name: correct
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the machine learning prediction
      was correct (true) or incorrect (false). This determines how the performance
      metrics are updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      bool predictionCorrect = true;

      tracker.RecordPrediction(botGuid, predictionCorrect);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Incorrect Prediction
    code: 'MLPerformanceTracker tracker;

      uint32_t botGuid = 67890;

      bool predictionCorrect = false;

      tracker.RecordPrediction(botGuid, predictionCorrect);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or data structures that track
    prediction accuracy. It may be called from within AI decision-making loops where
    bots make choices based on ML models and the results are compared against actual
    outcomes. The implementation should ideally be thread-safe if used in concurrent
    environments.
