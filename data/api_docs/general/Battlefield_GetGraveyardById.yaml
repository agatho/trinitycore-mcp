documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a Battlefield Graveyard object by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetGraveyardById method is used to retrieve a specific Battlefield
    Graveyard instance from the battlefield's collection of graveyards using its unique
    integer ID. This method is typically employed in World of Warcraft's Battlefield
    management system, particularly within the context of Wintergrasp and other battlegrounds
    where players can respawn at designated graveyard locations after death. The returned
    pointer may be null if no graveyard exists with the specified ID, which should
    be checked by the caller before dereferencing. This method provides direct access
    to graveyard data structures that control respawn points, faction ownership, and
    related battlefield mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a BfGraveyard object corresponding to the given ID, or nullptr
    if no graveyard with the specified ID exists in the battlefield.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BfGraveyard* graveyard = battlefield->GetGraveyardById(5);\nif (graveyard\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the graveyard object\n    uint32 factionId = graveyard->GetFactionId();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Graveyard
    code: "BfGraveyard* graveyard = battlefield->GetGraveyardById(10);\nif (graveyard\
      \ == nullptr)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid graveyard ID requested\");\n\
      \    return;\n}\n// Safe to use graveyard here\nWorldLocation location = graveyard->GetSpawnPoint();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation on an internal collection of graveyards,
    which may have performance implications if called frequently in tight loops. The
    returned pointer is valid only as long as the battlefield instance exists and
    the graveyard has not been removed from the system.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before using the returned BfGraveyard
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults. This method assumes that the ID parameter
    corresponds to a valid graveyard in the current battlefield context, but does
    not validate this assumption internally.
