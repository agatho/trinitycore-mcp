documentation:
  brief: Handles AI behavior when a unit enters the escort AI's line of sight
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core component of the EscortAI class
    that manages the artificial intelligence behavior when a unit (typically a player)
    comes within the line of sight of an escorted NPC. This method is automatically
    invoked by the TrinityCore engine when a unit enters the AI's detection range.
    It typically triggers the escort AI to respond to the presence of nearby units,
    potentially initiating dialogue, changing movement patterns, or updating the quest
    state. The method is part of the standard AI event handling system and integrates
    with the broader quest and NPC interaction framework in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unit ID that entered the line
      of sight. This typically corresponds to a player or creature GUID, though the
      exact implementation may vary based on how the AI system processes incoming
      events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom escort AI
    code: "class MyEscortAI : public EscortAI {\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(int*\
      \ who) override {\n        // Custom logic when unit enters line of sight\n\
      \        if (*who == playerGUID) {\n            SendTalk(\"Hello there, adventurer!\"\
      );\n        }\n        EscortAI::MoveInLineOfSight(who);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the core game engine during AI update
    cycles. Developers should ensure that custom implementations properly call the
    base class implementation to maintain standard AI behavior. The parameter 'who'
    may be null or invalid in certain edge cases, so robust error checking is recommended.
  warnings: Incorrectly overriding this method without calling the parent implementation
    can break standard escort AI functionality. Always verify that the unit ID passed
    is valid before performing operations on it.
