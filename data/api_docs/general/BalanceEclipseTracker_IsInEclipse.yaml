  class: BalanceEclipseTracker
  method: IsInEclipse
  signature: bool BalanceEclipseTracker::IsInEclipse() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in an eclipse state.
  description: The IsInEclipse method checks if the player character is currently
    within an eclipse state, which occurs when the player's mana is below a certain
    threshold and they are in a specific celestial alignment. This method is typically
    used by the Balance Druid class to determine whether their eclipse powers are
    active. The eclipse state affects spell casting and can influence the behavior
    of certain abilities such as Eclipse spells or lunar and solar empowerment effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in an eclipse state, false otherwise.
    An eclipse state typically occurs when the player's mana is low and they are in
    a specific celestial alignment that affects their spell casting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check eclipse status
    code: "if (player->GetBalanceEclipseTracker()->IsInEclipse()) {\n    // Player\
      \ is in eclipse state\n    // Apply eclipse-specific logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using eclipse status for spell casting decisions
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nBalanceEclipseTracker* tracker = player->GetBalanceEclipseTracker();\n\
      if (tracker->IsInEclipse()) {\n    // Cast eclipse-affected spells\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ECLIPSE_LUNAR, true);\n} else {\n    // Cast normal spells\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_NORMAL_LUNAR, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of the player's mana levels and celestial
    alignment state. The eclipse state may be influenced by various factors including
    spell usage, time-based effects, and other game mechanics related to Balance Druid
    gameplay.
  warnings: The eclipse state is not static and can change dynamically during gameplay.
    This method should not be used as a persistent condition check without considering
    that the state may change between calls. Additionally, this method only reflects
    the current eclipse status and does not account for future state changes.
