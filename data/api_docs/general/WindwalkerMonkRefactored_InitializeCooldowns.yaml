  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for Windwalker Monk abilities
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for the Windwalker Monk class. This method is typically called during player
    initialization or when switching to the Windwalker Monk specialization. It establishes
    the baseline cooldown states for key abilities such as Spinning Crane Kick, Rushing
    Jade Wind, and other core mechanics. The method ensures that all abilities start
    with proper cooldown values and tracking mechanisms in place for accurate gameplay
    behavior.

  notes: This method should only be called once during the player's class initialization.
    It is typically invoked by the core TrinityCore framework when a player selects
    or switches to the Windwalker Monk specialization. The method does not directly
    modify any player state beyond cooldown setup.
