documentation:
  brief: Creates a new WorldLayer ObjectGuid with specified parameters
  description: The CreateWorldLayer method generates a unique ObjectGuid specifically
    for world layer entities within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    used when creating or managing game objects, creatures, or other entities that
    exist within a specific world layer context. The generated GUID follows TrinityCore's
    internal GUID structure and is designed to ensure uniqueness across all world
    layers. The method takes four parameters that define various aspects of the GUID's
    composition, including type identifiers, zone information, and instance data.
  parameters:
  - name: arg1
    description: Primary identifier for the world layer entity type, typically representing
      a specific object or entity class
  - name: arg2
    description: Zone or area identifier that defines the geographical context of
      the world layer entity
  - name: arg3
    description: Layer-specific flag or category value that determines the entity's
      behavior within the world layer system
  - name: arg4
    description: Instance or session identifier that provides context for multi-instance
      world layer scenarios
  returns: Returns a fully constructed ObjectGuid object that uniquely identifies
    a world layer entity within the TrinityCore framework. The returned GUID follows
    the standard World of Warcraft GUID format with appropriate type and data fields
    populated according to the input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic WorldLayer GUID Creation
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWorldLayer(12345, 6789, 1, 42);

      // Creates a world layer GUID for an entity with ID 12345 in zone 6789'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating GUID for Specific World Layer Entity
    code: 'uint32 creatureId = 50001;

      uint16 zoneId = 1234;

      uint8 layerType = 2;

      uint32 instanceId = 98765;


      ObjectGuid worldLayerGuid = ObjectGuidFactory::CreateWorldLayer(creatureId,
      zoneId, layerType, instanceId);

      // Generates a GUID for a creature in a specific zone and instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal GUID management system. The
    ObjectGuid returned by this method should be used exclusively for world layer
    entities. The parameters must be carefully chosen to ensure proper categorization
    and avoid conflicts with other GUID types. This method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters, so developers should ensure valid values are passed.
  warnings: Do not use this method for creating GUIDs outside of the world layer context
    as it may result in invalid or conflicting GUIDs. The method assumes all parameters
    are valid and properly formatted. Incorrect parameter values can lead to GUID
    collisions or unexpected behavior in the game world.
