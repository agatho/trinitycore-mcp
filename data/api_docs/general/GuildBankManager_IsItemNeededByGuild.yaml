  signature: bool GuildBankManager::IsItemNeededByGuild(int * guild, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific item is needed by the guild for its current
    needs.
  description: The IsItemNeededByGuild method evaluates if a given item is required
    by the guild based on its current inventory, banking rules, and guild configuration.
    This function checks against the guild's bank tab settings and item usage requirements
    to determine whether the item should be considered essential or not. It is typically
    used during guild bank operations to identify items that may need to be retained
    or moved for optimal guild resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      likely refers to a guild's unique ID or index within the game's internal data
      structures.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item being evaluated. This corresponds
      to the item's entry in the game's item database and is used to determine its
      properties and requirements.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item is needed by the guild according to
    current rules and inventory status; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is needed by the guild
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nuint32 itemId = 123456;\nbool needed = guildBankManager->IsItemNeededByGuild(&guildId,\
      \ itemId);\nif (needed) {\n    // Handle case where item is needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank tab configurations
    and item usage rules. It may be used in conjunction with other guild banking functions
    to maintain optimal inventory distribution across tabs.
