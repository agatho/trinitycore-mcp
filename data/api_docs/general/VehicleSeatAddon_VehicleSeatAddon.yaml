  class: VehicleSeatAddon
  method: VehicleSeatAddon
  signature: void VehicleSeatAddon::VehicleSeatAddon(float orientatonOffset, float
    exitX, float exitY, float exitZ, float exitO, uint8 param)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a vehicle seat addon with specified orientation and exit coordinates.
  description: The VehicleSeatAddon constructor initializes a vehicle seat addon object
    with provided parameters including orientation offset, exit position (X, Y, Z),
    exit orientation, and a parameter value. This method is typically used to configure
    the positioning and behavior of passenger seats within vehicle templates in TrinityCore.
    The orientation offset adjusts the seating angle relative to the vehicle's forward
    direction, while the exit coordinates define where passengers will be teleported
    when leaving the vehicle. The param value may control additional seat-specific
    behaviors or states.
  parameters:
  - name: orientatonOffset
    description: The angular offset (in radians) applied to the seat orientation relative
      to the vehicle's forward direction. Controls how the passenger is positioned
      within the seat.
  - name: exitX
    description: The X coordinate of the exit position where passengers will be teleported
      when disembarking from the vehicle.
  - name: exitY
    description: The Y coordinate of the exit position where passengers will be teleported
      when disembarking from the vehicle.
  - name: exitZ
    description: The Z coordinate of the exit position where passengers will be teleported
      when disembarking from the vehicle.
  - name: exitO
    description: The orientation (in radians) of the exit position, determining which
      direction passengers face upon leaving the vehicle.
  - name: param
    description: A uint8 parameter that may control additional seat-specific behaviors
      or states, such as seat type, animation flags, or passenger restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Seat Addon Initialization
    code: VehicleSeatAddon seatAddon(0.5f, 10.0f, 15.0f, 5.0f, 3.14f, 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Seat Addon with Specific Exit Coordinates
    code: 'VehicleSeatAddon seat(0.0f, -2.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.57f, 3);

      // This creates a seat that exits facing east (90 degrees) at position (-2,
      0, 0)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the vehicle system in TrinityCore and should be called
    during vehicle template initialization. The orientation values are typically in
    radians, not degrees. The param field is often used to indicate seat type or special
    properties like whether it's a driver seat or passenger seat.
  warnings: Incorrect orientation values may cause passengers to appear rotated incorrectly
    within the vehicle. Invalid exit coordinates could result in players being teleported
    to unexpected locations. Ensure that param values are within valid ranges for
    the intended seat behavior.
