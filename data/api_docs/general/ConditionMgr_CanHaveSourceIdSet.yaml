  class: ConditionMgr
  method: CanHaveSourceIdSet
  signature: bool ConditionMgr::CanHaveSourceIdSet(ConditionSourceType sourceType)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given condition source type can have its source ID set.
  description: The CanHaveSourceIdSet method checks if a specific ConditionSourceType
    is allowed to have a source identifier assigned. This functionality is crucial
    for validating condition system operations within TrinityCore's database and scripting
    mechanisms. The method evaluates internal mappings of condition types to determine
    their compatibility with source ID assignment, which is essential for proper condition
    evaluation during quest, gossip, and other interactive game events. It ensures
    that only appropriate condition types can utilize source IDs, maintaining data
    integrity and preventing invalid condition configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified condition source type supports having a source
    ID set; otherwise returns false. This boolean result indicates whether the condition
    system will accept source ID assignments for the given source type.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a condition type supports source ID assignment
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->CanHaveSourceIdSet(CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_CREATURE_TEMPLATE))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with source ID assignment logic\n    printf(\"Creature template\
      \ conditions support source IDs\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Creature template\
      \ conditions do not support source IDs\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal condition type mappings defined in
    the ConditionMgr class. It's important to note that this check is performed at
    runtime and may impact performance if called frequently during condition evaluation
    processes. The implementation probably uses a lookup table or similar data structure
    for fast determination of supported source types.
  warnings: Developers should not assume all condition source types support source
    ID assignment. Always verify using this method before attempting to set source
    IDs to prevent runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the condition system.
