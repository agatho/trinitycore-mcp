  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetSpellFocusType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell focus type associated with the game object template.
  description: The GetSpellFocusType method returns the spell focus type identifier
    for the GameObjectTemplate. This value determines which spell focus requirements
    a player must meet to interact with the game object. Spell focus types are defined
    in the database and correspond to specific game mechanics such as requiring a
    particular aura or item to be present. The returned value is used by the core
    to validate whether a player can use the object based on their current spell focus
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the spell focus type ID. A value of 0 typically
    indicates no spell focus is required, while other values correspond to specific
    spell focus definitions in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(176543);\n\
      uint32 focusType = goTemplate->GetSpellFocusType();\nif (focusType != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Object requires specific spell focus\n    sLog->outString(\"GameObject\
      \ requires spell focus type: %u\", focusType);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses data stored in the GameObjectTemplate's internal database
    fields. The returned value directly maps to entries in the spell_focus_mob_types
    table in the TrinityCore database.
