  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleRequestGuildRewardsList
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleRequestGuildRewardsList(WorldPackets::Guild::RequestGuildRewardsList
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to retrieve the guild rewards list for display in
    the guild interface.
  description: This method processes a packet sent by the client requesting the list
    of available guild rewards. It is typically invoked when a player opens the guild
    rewards window or attempts to view the rewards that can be purchased using guild
    currency. The method retrieves the relevant guild reward data from the database
    and sends it back to the client in a structured format. This functionality supports
    the in-game guild management system where players can exchange guild currency
    for various benefits such as cosmetic items, buffs, or other in-game advantages.
    The method does not require any specific preconditions beyond a valid session
    and an active guild membership.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within WorldSession
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestGuildRewardsList(WorldPackets::Guild::RequestGuildRewardsList&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Retrieve and send guild rewards list to the client\n  \
      \  SendGuildRewardsList();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the WorldSession class and is called as a result of
    a client-side packet. It assumes that the session has a valid player with an associated
    guild. The actual reward data retrieval may involve database queries or cached
    data structures depending on how TrinityCore implements guild reward systems.
