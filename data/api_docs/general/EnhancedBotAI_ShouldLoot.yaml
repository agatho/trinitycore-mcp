  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: ShouldLoot
  signature: bool EnhancedBotAI::ShouldLoot()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the enhanced bot should loot items from defeated enemies.
  description: The ShouldLoot method evaluates various conditions to decide if the
    enhanced bot should loot items from defeated enemies. It considers factors such
    as the bot's current inventory capacity, item quality thresholds, and configured
    loot settings. This method is typically called during the loot processing phase
    after a creature has been killed. The decision-making process ensures that bots
    do not overfill their inventories and only acquire items that meet specified criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot should loot items from the current target, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: "if (botAI->ShouldLoot()) {\n    // Proceed with loot operations\n    botAI->LootItems();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot decision logic
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnCreatureKilled(Unit* victim) {\n    if (ShouldLoot())\
      \ {\n        // Check if we have space for loot\n        if (CanStoreLoot())\
      \ {\n            LootCreature(victim);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called multiple times during a single loot operation.
    The decision is based on internal bot configuration and current inventory state.
    Performance is generally good as it only performs necessary checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without verifying that the bot has actually
    defeated an enemy. Calling ShouldLoot() in inappropriate contexts may lead to
    incorrect loot decisions or unexpected behavior.
