  class: BalanceDoTTracker
  method: BalanceDoTTracker
  signature: void BalanceDoTTracker::BalanceDoTTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BalanceDoTTracker class for managing balance
    spell damage over time effects.
  description: The BalanceDoTTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    BalanceDoTTracker class, which is responsible for tracking and managing damage-over-time
    effects applied by balance spells in the game. This class likely maintains information
    about active DoTs, their remaining duration, damage values, and associated targets.
    It serves as part of the spell effect system within TrinityCore's implementation
    of World of Warcraft's balance druid abilities, particularly focusing on maintaining
    accurate tracking of ongoing magical effects that deal periodic damage over time.

  - title: Creating a BalanceDoTTracker instance
    code: 'BalanceDoTTracker tracker;

      // This creates a new BalanceDoTTracker object ready to track DoT effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method that initializes internal tracking
    structures for balance spell DoTs. The actual implementation details would depend
    on how TrinityCore handles spell effect tracking, including potential use of smart
    pointers or reference counting for managing active DoT effects.
