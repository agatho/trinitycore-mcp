  class: InRangeCheckCustomizer
  method: Update
  signature: void InRangeCheckCustomizer::Update(const int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the in-range check customizer with the provided parameter values.
  description: The Update method of the InRangeCheckCustomizer class is responsible
    for processing and applying new parameter values to customize how in-range checks
    are performed within the TrinityCore framework. This method likely modifies internal
    state or configuration settings that affect object visibility, interaction range,
    or other gameplay mechanics related to player and NPC proximity detection. The
    method accepts a pointer to an integer array which may contain various flags,
    thresholds, or identifiers used for fine-tuning the behavior of in-range checks.
    It is typically invoked during runtime when system parameters need to be adjusted
    dynamically without requiring a full restart or reload of the game logic.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A pointer to an integer array containing configuration values that
      define how in-range checks should be customized. The exact meaning and structure
      of these integers depend on the implementation details of the InRangeCheckCustomizer
      class, but they may represent thresholds, flags, or identifiers used for adjusting
      proximity detection logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int customParams[] = {10, 20, 30};

      InRangeCheckCustomizer customizer;

      customizer.Update(customParams);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages object visibility
    and proximity detection in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine. It may be called
    from various subsystems such as AI, movement handling, or player interaction logic
    where dynamic adjustment of range checks is required.
  warnings: Since this method modifies internal state based on external parameters,
    improper usage could lead to unexpected behavior in object visibility or game
    mechanics. Ensure that the input array contains valid values and matches expected
    formats for the specific implementation.
