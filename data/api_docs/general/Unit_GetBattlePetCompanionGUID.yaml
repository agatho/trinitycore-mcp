documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet companion.
  description: This method retrieves the GUID of the battle pet companion associated
    with the unit. The GUID represents a unique identifier within the game world that
    distinguishes the battle pet from other entities. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with battle pet mechanics and can be essential for identifying
    specific pet companions in player versus player or player versus NPC scenarios.
    It should be noted that this method may return different values depending on whether
    the unit is a player, NPC, or creature, and the GUID is usually obtained through
    internal game state tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the battle pet companion. The
    value can vary based on the type of unit and its current battle pet status. If
    no battle pet companion exists, this value may be zero or negative depending on
    implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int guid = unit->GetBattlePetCompanionGUID();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for identifying battle pet companions in game
    mechanics. The GUID returned may be subject to change during gameplay, especially
    when pets are summoned or dismissed. Implementation details vary based on the
    type of unit (player, NPC, etc.) and should be carefully considered when using
    this method.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return zero or negative
    values if no battle pet companion exists. Also, ensure that the unit is properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid potential null pointer dereferences.
