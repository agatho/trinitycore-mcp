  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CheckLineOfSight
  signature: LoSResult LineOfSightManager::CheckLineOfSight(const int & targetPos,
    LoSCheckType checkType)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if there is a clear line of sight between two points in the game world.
  description: The CheckLineOfSight method determines whether a direct path exists
    between two positions in the game world, taking into account obstacles such as
    walls, terrain, and other solid objects. This functionality is crucial for determining
    visibility for spells, abilities, and NPC interactions. The method evaluates the
    specified check type to determine how strict or lenient the line of sight calculation
    should be. It returns a LoSResult enum indicating whether the line of sight is
    clear, blocked, or otherwise handled according to the defined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: targetPos
    description: The target position to check line of sight against. This parameter
      represents a point in 3D space (likely using coordinates or a WorldObject reference)
      from which the line of sight is evaluated.
  - name: checkType
    description: Specifies the type of line of sight check to perform. This enum determines
      how the method handles various blocking scenarios, such as whether to consider
      small gaps, specific object types, or other game mechanics like spell penetration
      or vision range limits.
  returns: 'Returns a LoSResult enum indicating the outcome of the line of sight check.
    Possible values may include: LOS_CLEAR (no obstruction), LOS_BLOCKED (obstruction
    present), and potentially others depending on implementation details.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line of Sight Check
    code: "if (LoSResult result = lineOfSightManager.CheckLineOfSight(targetPosition,\
      \ LoSCheckType::STANDARD);\n    result == LoSResult::LOS_CLEAR)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with spell casting or interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Line of Sight Check with Custom Type
    code: "LoSCheckType customCheck = LoSCheckType::SPELL_PENETRATION;\nLoSResult\
      \ result = lineOfSightManager.CheckLineOfSight(targetObject, customCheck);\n\
      if (result == LoSResult::LOS_CLEAR)\n{\n    // Cast spell that can penetrate\
      \ some barriers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial partitioning or raycasting algorithms internally
    to efficiently determine if a direct path exists. Performance may be impacted
    by complex terrain or numerous obstacles in the path. The method is thread-safe
    and should not be called from within critical sections without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the target position passed into this method is valid and represents
    a real location in the game world; otherwise, results may be unpredictable or
    cause errors. Using incorrect check types can lead to unexpected behavior in spell
    targeting or NPC vision systems.
