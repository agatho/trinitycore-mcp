  signature: bool VehicleJoinEvent::Execute(uint64 param0, uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the vehicle join event logic for a player entering a vehicle
  description: The VehicleJoinEvent::Execute method handles the core functionality
    when a player attempts to board a vehicle in World of Warcraft. This method validates
    the player's ability to enter the vehicle, manages the transition process, and
    updates relevant game state including passenger assignments, vehicle status flags,
    and player movement constraints. The method ensures proper synchronization between
    client and server states during vehicle entry, handling edge cases such as invalid
    vehicle entries or conflicting passenger slots. It returns true if the join operation
    was successful and false if it failed due to validation errors or system constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The GUID of the player attempting to join the vehicle
  - name: param1
    description: The seat index within the vehicle where the player will be seated
      (0-7)
  returns: Returns true if the player successfully joined the vehicle, false otherwise.
    Failure conditions include invalid GUID, invalid seat index, vehicle already full,
    or player not in range of the vehicle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Join
    code: "VehicleJoinEvent event;\nuint64 playerGuid = 123456789ULL;\nuint32 seatIndex\
      \ = 0;\nbool success = event.Execute(playerGuid, seatIndex);\nif (success)\n\
      \    printf(\"Player successfully joined the vehicle\\n\");\nelse\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to join vehicle\\n\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Vehicle Join with Error Handling
    code: "VehicleJoinEvent event;\nuint64 playerGuid = 123456789ULL;\nuint32 seatIndex\
      \ = 3;\n\nif (event.Execute(playerGuid, seatIndex)) {\n    // Vehicle join successful\n\
      \    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(playerGuid);\n    if (player)\
      \ {\n        player->SetInVehicle(true);\n        player->SetVehicleSeat(seatIndex);\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // Handle failed vehicle join\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Unable to board vehicle.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the Vehicle::AddPassenger() function
    and should only be invoked when a player is attempting to enter a vehicle. The
    method performs validation checks including range, vehicle status, and passenger
    slot availability. It's important to note that this method does not directly send
    packets to clients; it primarily handles internal state management.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper pre-validation of the
    player and vehicle states. Calling with invalid GUID or seat index values may
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. This method assumes the vehicle object is
    valid and properly initialized before execution.
