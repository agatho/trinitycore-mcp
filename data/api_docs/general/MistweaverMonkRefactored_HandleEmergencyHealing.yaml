  class: MistweaverMonkRefactored
  method: HandleEmergencyHealing
  signature: bool MistweaverMonkRefactored::HandleEmergencyHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Performs emergency healing on a specified group member in the Mistweaver
    Monk class.
  description: The HandleEmergencyHealing method is responsible for executing emergency
    healing mechanics specific to the Mistweaver Monk specialization in World of Warcraft.
    This method targets a designated group member and applies an emergency healing
    effect, typically used during high-priority situations such as when a group member
    is critically low on health or under immediate threat. The method evaluates the
    current state of the target, checks for valid healing conditions, and performs
    the necessary healing action. It is designed to be invoked during combat scenarios
    where rapid response healing is required to maintain group survivability.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The index or identifier of the group member to receive emergency
      healing. Valid values are typically integers representing group positions (0-4)
      or player GUIDs depending on implementation details.
  returns: Returns true if the emergency healing was successfully applied to the target,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid target, insufficient mana, or
    other game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emergency Healing Usage
    code: "if (player->GetClass() == CLASS_MONK) {\n    MistweaverMonkRefactored*\
      \ monk = static_cast<MistweaverMonkRefactored*>(player);\n    bool success =\
      \ monk->HandleEmergencyHealing(2); // Heal group member at index 2\n    if (success)\
      \ {\n        // Healing applied successfully\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's mana pool and healing cooldowns.
    It may also trigger specific visual effects or animations for emergency healing
    abilities. The implementation assumes that group management is handled externally,
    and this method only performs the healing action itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the target group member is valid and within range before calling
    this method to avoid potential errors or unexpected behavior. Calling this method
    without proper group context may lead to undefined behavior.
