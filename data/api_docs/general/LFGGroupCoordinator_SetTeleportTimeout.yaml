  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: SetTeleportTimeout
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::SetTeleportTimeout(uint32 timeout)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the teleport timeout value for the LFG group coordinator.
  description: The SetTeleportTimeout method configures the time duration (in milliseconds)
    after which a player will be teleported out of a LFG (Looking For Group) instance
    if they have not completed the required actions. This timeout is used to prevent
    players from remaining idle in LFG instances, ensuring efficient resource usage
    and maintaining game balance. The method updates an internal timer that governs
    the teleportation behavior for the group coordinator's LFG activities.
  parameters:
  - name: timeout
    description: The timeout value in milliseconds to set for the teleportation delay.
      This determines how long a player can remain inactive before being automatically
      teleported out of the LFG instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 30-second teleport timeout
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.SetTeleportTimeout(30000); // 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring a 2-minute teleport timeout for LFG groups
    code: "LFGGroupCoordinator* coord = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator(playerGuid);\n\
      if (coord)\n{\n    coord->SetTeleportTimeout(120000); // 2 minutes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the LFG group's behavior and should be used
    carefully to avoid disrupting player experience. The timeout value is typically
    set based on game balance considerations, such as preventing long idle times in
    dungeons or raids.
  warnings: Setting a very low timeout may result in players being teleported out
    too quickly, especially during complex encounters or when coordination is needed
    among group members. Ensure that the timeout value aligns with expected gameplay
    duration and player expectations.
