  method: HasOverridePosition
  signature: bool AreaTrigger::HasOverridePosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the area trigger has an overridden position set.
  description: The HasOverridePosition method determines if the area trigger's position
    has been explicitly overridden from its default value. This is commonly used in
    scenarios where area triggers need to be dynamically positioned, such as during
    certain spell effects or scripted events. The method returns true if a custom
    position has been assigned via SetOverridePosition, and false otherwise. This
    functionality allows for flexible positioning of area triggers without modifying
    their base template data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger has an override position set; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for override position
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasOverridePosition()) {\n    // Handle case where position\
      \ is overridden\n    Position overridePos = areaTrigger->GetOverridePosition();\n\
      \    // Use overridePos for custom logic\n} else {\n    // Use default position\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional logic based on override status
    code: "if (areaTrigger->HasOverridePosition()) {\n    // Override position exists,\
      \ use it\n    areaTrigger->SetPosition(areaTrigger->GetOverridePosition());\n\
      } else {\n    // No override, reset to default\n    areaTrigger->ResetToDefaultPosition();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with SetOverridePosition and
    GetOverridePosition. The override position is not automatically applied to the
    area trigger's actual position; it must be explicitly set using the corresponding
    setter method. This design allows for temporary or conditional overrides without
    permanently altering the trigger's base properties.
  warnings: Be cautious when checking HasOverridePosition in performance-critical
    code paths, as this method may involve accessing internal state variables. Additionally,
    ensure that any override position is properly validated before use to prevent
    unexpected behavior in area trigger positioning.
