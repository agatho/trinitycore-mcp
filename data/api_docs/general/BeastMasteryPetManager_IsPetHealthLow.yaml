documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's beast mastery pet has low health.
  description: The IsPetHealthLow method evaluates the current health status of the
    player's beast mastery pet and returns true if the pet's health is below a certain
    threshold, typically indicating that the pet requires attention or healing. This
    method is commonly used in AI logic to trigger defensive behaviors or healing
    actions when the pet is at risk. The exact threshold for 'low health' may be defined
    by game mechanics or configurable parameters within the beast mastery system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the pet's current health is below the defined low-health
    threshold, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (beastMasteryPetManager->IsPetHealthLow()) {\n    // Trigger pet healing\
      \ or defensive action\n    player->CastSpell(pet, SPELL_HEAL_PET);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the pet's health and may be affected
    by temporary buffs, debuffs, or game mechanics that alter health calculations.
    It should only be called when a valid pet is present.
