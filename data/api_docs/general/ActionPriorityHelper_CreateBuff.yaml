  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: CreateBuff
  signature: PrioritizedAction ActionPriorityHelper::CreateBuff(uint32 spellId, int
    * target, uint32 remainingDuration)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a prioritized action for applying a spell buff to a target.
  description: The CreateBuff method generates a PrioritizedAction object that represents
    the intent to apply a specified spell buff to a target unit. This method is typically
    used within AI decision-making systems to prioritize actions based on spell effectiveness,
    cooldown status, and target requirements. The returned action includes information
    about the spell ID, target selection, and duration remaining for the buff. It
    integrates with TrinityCore's action priority system to ensure proper sequencing
    of abilities during combat.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be applied as a buff. Must
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit index or GUID.
      Can be NULL if targeting self or default behavior is desired.
  - name: remainingDuration
    description: The remaining duration of the buff in milliseconds. Used to determine
      if a new application is needed or if existing buff should be refreshed.
  returns: A PrioritizedAction object containing all necessary information to execute
    the buff application, including spell ID, target reference, and priority level
    for execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic buff creation for target
    code: PrioritizedAction action = helper.CreateBuff(12345, &targetGuid, 30000);
      // Apply buff with 30 second duration
    language: cpp
  - title: Self-targeted buff creation
    code: PrioritizedAction action = helper.CreateBuff(67890, nullptr, 15000); //
      Apply buff to self for 15 seconds
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the spell ID is valid and the target is accessible. The
    returned action should be added to an action queue or priority list for execution.
    Duration parameter helps avoid unnecessary reapplication when buff is still active.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId corresponds to a real buff spell in the database,
    otherwise the action may fail silently. Passing invalid target pointers can lead
    to undefined behavior.
