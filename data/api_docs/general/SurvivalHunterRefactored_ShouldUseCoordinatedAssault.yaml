  class: SurvivalHunterRefactored
  method: ShouldUseCoordinatedAssault
  signature: bool SurvivalHunterRefactored::ShouldUseCoordinatedAssault(int * target)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the survival hunter should use the Coordinated Assault
    ability based on current combat state and target conditions.
  description: This method evaluates the current game state and target conditions
    to decide if the Coordinated Assault ability should be used. It checks factors
    such as target health, distance, available resources, and tactical positioning.
    The method returns true when the ability is deemed beneficial for the hunter's
    survival and damage output in the current combat scenario. This decision-making
    process considers both immediate threat assessment and long-term strategic advantages
    of using the ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Coordinated Assault should be used, false otherwise. The
    decision is based on evaluating target conditions, hunter resource state, and
    tactical positioning within the current combat environment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "if (hunter->ShouldUseCoordinatedAssault(nullptr)) {\n    hunter->CastSpell(target,\
      \ COORDINATED_ASSAULT_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state evaluation
    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UpdateCombatAI() {\n    if (ShouldUseCoordinatedAssault(&targetGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Execute coordinated assault logic\n        UseAbility(COORDINATED_ASSAULT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the survival hunter's tactical decision-making system.
    It may consider factors like target proximity, health percentage, and cooldown
    states of other abilities. The implementation likely uses internal state tracking
    to make these decisions efficiently during combat.
  warnings: The method signature shows a pointer parameter that is not used in the
    current documentation context. Ensure proper handling of the target parameter
    if it's intended to be utilized in actual implementation. This method should only
    be called during active combat scenarios for optimal results.
