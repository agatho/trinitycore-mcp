documentation:
  brief: Processes player movement towards their corpse after death in the DeathRecoveryManager.
  description: The HandleRunningToCorpse method manages the logic for a player character's
    automatic return to their corpse following death. This function is typically invoked
    during the game loop with a time delta parameter to control movement speed and
    timing. It handles the transition from death state back to the corpse location,
    including pathfinding, movement updates, and potential interaction with the death
    recovery system. The method ensures that players can smoothly return to their
    corpse without manual intervention, which is a core gameplay mechanic in World
    of Warcraft's death and resurrection system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    deathRecoveryManager.HandleRunningToCorpse(diff);\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automatic death recovery system and should be
    called regularly during the game update cycle. It may involve pathfinding calculations
    and movement updates that could impact performance if not properly throttled or
    optimized. The implementation likely interacts with the player's movement state
    and corpse positioning logic.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can cause players to become stuck or
    unable to return to their corpse, potentially breaking the death recovery mechanic.
    Ensure proper synchronization with other game systems that manage player states
    and movement.
