  class: GameEventMgr
  method: ApplyNewEvent
  signature: void GameEventMgr::ApplyNewEvent(uint16 event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a game event by its ID, applying all associated event modifications
    to the world.
  description: The ApplyNewEvent method is responsible for activating a specific game
    event within the TrinityCore server environment. When called with a valid event
    ID, it triggers the activation process which typically includes modifying creature
    spawns, game object states, quest conditions, and other event-related mechanics.
    This method ensures that all aspects of the specified event are properly initialized
    and applied to the game world. The method is commonly invoked during server startup
    or when an event is manually triggered through in-game commands or external scripts.
    It's important to note that this method does not validate whether the event ID
    exists; calling it with an invalid ID may result in undefined behavior or silent
    failures.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to be activated. This value
      corresponds to the ID field in the game_event table within the database. Valid
      values are positive integers that match existing event definitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Activation
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->ApplyNewEvent(1234);
    language: cpp
  - title: Activating Multiple Events in Sequence
    code: 'GameEventMgr* eventMgr = GameEventMgr::instance();


      // Activate holiday event

      eventMgr->ApplyNewEvent(5678);


      // Activate seasonal event

      eventMgr->ApplyNewEvent(9012);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies global server state and may affect multiple subsystems
    including creature AI, quest systems, and object spawning. It should be used carefully
    during runtime as it can cause unexpected behavior if not properly coordinated
    with other event management functions. The method assumes that the event data
    has already been loaded into memory through proper initialization routines.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent event_id may lead
    to server instability or undefined behavior. Always ensure that the event ID corresponds
    to a valid entry in the game_event database table before invoking this method.
    Additionally, frequent calls to this method during active gameplay can cause performance
    degradation due to the extensive modifications it performs on world objects.
