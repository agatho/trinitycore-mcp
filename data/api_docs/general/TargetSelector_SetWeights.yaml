documentation:
  brief: Sets the target weights for the target selection algorithm
  description: Configures the weighting parameters used by the TargetSelector to evaluate
    and choose targets during AI decision-making processes. This method allows customization
    of target priority based on various factors such as threat level, distance, health,
    or other combat-related metrics. The weights are typically used in conjunction
    with target selection strategies to determine the most appropriate enemy to attack
    or focus on. This configuration directly impacts the AI's behavior and tactical
    decisions during combat encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: weights
    description: A constant reference to a TargetWeights structure containing the
      weight values for different target evaluation criteria
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weight Configuration
    code: 'TargetWeights weights;

      weights.threatWeight = 0.7f;

      weights.distanceWeight = 0.2f;

      weights.healthWeight = 0.1f;

      targetSelector.SetWeights(weights);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Target Selection Weights
    code: 'TargetWeights customWeights;

      customWeights.threatWeight = 0.8f;

      customWeights.distanceWeight = 0.1f;

      customWeights.healthWeight = 0.1f;

      customWeights.aggressionWeight = 0.5f;

      targetSelector.SetWeights(customWeights);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The TargetSelector's behavior is entirely dependent on the provided weights
    configuration. Changing weights dynamically during combat may affect AI decision-making
    in real-time. This method does not validate the weight values, so developers should
    ensure that weights are within reasonable ranges (typically 0.0f to 1.0f) for
    optimal performance.
  warnings: Setting all weights to zero or negative values may result in undefined
    behavior or poor target selection. The weights should sum to approximately 1.0f
    for balanced targeting decisions, though this is not strictly enforced. Improper
    weight configuration can lead to AI selecting inappropriate targets or failing
    to select any target at all.
