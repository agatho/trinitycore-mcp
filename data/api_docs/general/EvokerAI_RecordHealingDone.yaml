  class: EvokerAI
  method: RecordHealingDone
  signature: void EvokerAI::RecordHealingDone(int amount, int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Records the amount of healing done by the evoker to a target.
  description: The RecordHealingDone method is used within the EvokerAI class to track
    and log the total amount of healing performed by an evoker creature or player.
    This functionality is typically utilized for maintaining internal statistics,
    calculating performance metrics, or triggering specific behaviors based on healing
    output. The method accepts an integer representing the healing amount and a pointer
    to the target unit that received the healing. It does not return any value but
    updates internal tracking variables within the AI context.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: An integer value indicating the total healing amount applied to the
      target. Must be a non-negative integer representing effective healing points.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to an integer that represents the target unit receiving
      the healing. This parameter is expected to point to a valid target identifier
      or handle within the game's object system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Record
    code: 'int healingAmount = 500;

      int targetGuid = 12345;

      this->RecordHealingDone(healingAmount, &targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Healing with Dynamic Target
    code: "Unit* target = unit->GetVictim();\nif (target)\n{\n    int healingDone\
      \ = 300;\n    int* targetPtr = reinterpret_cast<int*>(&target->GetGUID());\n\
      \    this->RecordHealingDone(healingDone, targetPtr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for tracking AI behavior and
    performance. The target parameter may be used in conjunction with other methods
    to maintain detailed logs or trigger events based on healing thresholds.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer passed is valid to avoid undefined behavior.
    Passing null or invalid pointers can lead to crashes or incorrect data recording.
