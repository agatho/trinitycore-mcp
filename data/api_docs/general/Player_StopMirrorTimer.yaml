  signature: void Player::StopMirrorTimer(MirrorTimerType Type)
documentation:
  brief: Stops a specified mirror timer for the player.
  description: The StopMirrorTimer method halts a currently running mirror timer associated
    with the player. Mirror timers are used in World of Warcraft to track various
    time-based effects such as feign death, swimming, or other temporary states that
    have a visual countdown. This method takes a MirrorTimerType parameter to identify
    which specific timer should be stopped. The method does not return any value and
    is typically called internally by the game engine when a timer's condition is
    no longer valid or when the player's state changes.
  parameters:
  - name: Type
    description: Specifies the type of mirror timer to stop. This parameter determines
      which timer effect will be halted, such as feign death, swimming, or other timed
      visual effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Stopping a Feign Death Timer
    code: player->StopMirrorTimer(MIRROR_TIMER_FEIGN_DEATH);
    language: cpp
  - title: Stopping All Active Mirror Timers
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_MIRROR_TIMERS; ++i)\n{\n    player->StopMirrorTimer(MirrorTimerType(i));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal timer management system in TrinityCore.
    It's generally not called directly by addons or scripts but may be invoked during
    state transitions or when effects expire. The MirrorTimerType enumeration typically
    includes values like MIRROR_TIMER_FEIGN_DEATH, MIRROR_TIMER_SWIMMING, etc.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid MirrorTimerType value could lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the timer type being stopped is valid
    and currently active before calling this function.
