  method: ValidateConfiguration
  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::ValidateConfiguration()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the player bot configuration settings for correctness and consistency.
  description: The ValidateConfiguration method checks the current player bot configuration
    to ensure all settings are valid and consistent with expected values. It performs
    various validation checks on configuration parameters such as bot behavior settings,
    skill levels, and interaction rules. This method is typically called during initialization
    or when configuration changes are applied to prevent invalid states that could
    cause unexpected behavior in the player bot system. The validation process may
    include checking for out-of-range values, conflicting settings, missing required
    fields, and ensuring that all referenced resources exist.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all configuration settings pass validation checks, false
    otherwise. When validation fails, specific error messages are typically logged
    to help identify problematic configuration values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Validation
    code: "PlayerbotConfig config;\nbool isValid = config.ValidateConfiguration();\n\
      if (!isValid) {\n    // Handle invalid configuration\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\"\
      , \"Player bot configuration is invalid\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Initialization Context
    code: "void InitializePlayerBots() {\n    PlayerbotConfig config;\n    if (config.ValidateConfiguration())\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with bot initialization\n        LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\"\
      , \"Configuration validated successfully\");\n    } else {\n        // Abort\
      \ initialization and log errors\n        LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Failed to\
      \ validate configuration, aborting bot initialization\");\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during player bot system startup
    or when configuration files are reloaded. It may perform expensive operations
    such as file system checks or database queries to validate referenced resources.
    The validation process is designed to be comprehensive but not overly restrictive,
    allowing for reasonable flexibility in configuration while preventing clearly
    invalid setups.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized PlayerbotConfig instance may lead
    to undefined behavior. The method should only be called after the configuration
    has been properly loaded or initialized with valid data. If validation fails,
    it's important to handle the error gracefully and avoid proceeding with potentially
    broken bot behavior.
