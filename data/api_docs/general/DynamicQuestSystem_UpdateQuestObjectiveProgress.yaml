  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress(QuestProgress &
    progress, const Quest * quest, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress of a quest objective for a player in the dynamic quest
    system.
  description: The UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress method is responsible for advancing
    or modifying the progress state of a specific quest objective associated with
    a player. This method typically handles the internal logic required to track how
    close a player is to completing a quest's objectives, such as killing monsters,
    collecting items, or reaching certain locations. It interacts with the QuestProgress
    structure and the associated Quest data to ensure that the player's progress is
    accurately reflected in the game state. The method is commonly invoked when a
    player performs actions that contribute to quest completion, such as defeating
    enemies or interacting with objects.
  parameters:
  - name: progress
    description: A reference to the QuestProgress structure that holds the current
      progress data for the quest objective being updated.
  - name: quest
    description: A pointer to the Quest object that defines the quest whose objectives
      are being progressed. This provides context for how the progress should be interpreted
      and applied.
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      progress is being updated. This is used to determine which player's progress
      data should be modified.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerKill(Player* player, Creature* target) {\n    if (player->GetQuestStatus(12345)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE) {\n        QuestProgress progress;\n        const\
      \ Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n        DynamicQuestSystem::UpdateQuestObjectiveProgress(progress,\
      \ quest, player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dynamic quest system and may be called frequently
    during gameplay. Ensure that progress updates are synchronized with the game's
    state to avoid inconsistencies. The method assumes valid pointers for all parameters,
    and improper usage can lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the player has an active
    quest and that the progress data is correctly initialized. Passing null pointers
    or invalid quest templates may cause crashes or incorrect quest progression.
