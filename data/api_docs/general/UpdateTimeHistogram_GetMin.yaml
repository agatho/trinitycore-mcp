  class: UpdateTimeHistogram
  method: GetMin
  signature: uint32 UpdateTimeHistogram::GetMin() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum recorded update time value from the histogram.
  description: The GetMin method returns the smallest recorded update time value stored
    within the UpdateTimeHistogram instance. This histogram is typically used to track
    performance metrics such as the duration of various game updates or operations.
    The returned value represents the fastest recorded time in milliseconds. This
    method is commonly used for performance monitoring and optimization purposes within
    the TrinityCore framework. No parameters are required, and the method is thread-safe
    if the underlying data structure supports concurrent access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the minimum update time recorded in the histogram,
    measured in milliseconds. Returns 0 if no values have been recorded yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Minimum Update Time
    code: 'UpdateTimeHistogram histogram;

      // ... populate histogram with data ...

      uint32 minTime = histogram.GetMin();

      printf("Minimum update time: %u ms\n", minTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Minimum Time for Performance Analysis
    code: "UpdateTimeHistogram updateHistogram;\n// Simulate some operations and record\
      \ times\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)\n{\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // Some operation\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end\
      \ - start).count();\n    updateHistogram.AddValue(duration);\n}\nuint32 minTime\
      \ = updateHistogram.GetMin();\nprintf(\"Fastest operation took: %u ms\\n\",\
      \ minTime);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the histogram has been properly initialized and populated
    with values. If no values have been added to the histogram, it will return 0.
    The implementation may use atomic operations or locking mechanisms depending on
    how the histogram is designed for thread safety.
  warnings: Ensure that the histogram instance is not modified concurrently while
    calling this method if thread safety is a concern. Also, be aware that returning
    0 might indicate either no data or an actual minimum value of zero milliseconds,
    so consider adding validation logic if needed.
