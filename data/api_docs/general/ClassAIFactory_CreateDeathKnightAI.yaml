documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Death Knight AI instance for a bot character
  description: The CreateDeathKnightAI method is responsible for instantiating a Death
    Knight AI behavior for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the necessary data structures,
    and configures the AI to handle Death Knight-specific gameplay mechanics such
    as rune management, ability usage, and combat strategies. The method returns an
    identifier that can be used to reference the created AI instance. This functionality
    is typically used in bot systems where automated player characters need to exhibit
    Death Knight class behavior in various game scenarios including PvP and PvE encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer that will receive the unique identifier for
      the created Death Knight AI instance. This parameter must point to a valid memory
      location where the method can store the returned identifier.
  returns: Returns 0 on successful creation of the Death Knight AI instance, or a
    non-zero error code if the operation fails. A return value of 0 indicates that
    the bot parameter has been properly initialized with a valid AI identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId;\nint result = factory->CreateDeathKnightAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Successfully created Death Knight AI with ID: botId\n    printf(\"\
      Death Knight AI created with ID: %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\
      \ case\n    printf(\"Failed to create Death Knight AI\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    int CreateAndInitializeDeathKnightBot()\
      \ {\n        int botId;\n        int result = aiFactory->CreateDeathKnightAI(&botId);\n\
      \        if (result == 0) {\n            // Store the bot ID in our internal\
      \ tracking system\n            registeredBots[botId] = BOT_TYPE_DEATH_KNIGHT;\n\
      \            return botId;\n        }\n        return -1; // Error occurred\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore AI system and assumes that the necessary
    AI subsystems are properly initialized. The returned bot identifier should be
    used for subsequent operations on the AI instance such as setting behaviors, updating
    states, or destroying the AI when no longer needed. The implementation may involve
    memory allocation and initialization overhead.
  warnings: The parameter 'bot' must point to a valid integer variable; passing NULL
    or an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. Ensure that the AI factory
    is properly initialized before calling this method, as it may depend on other
    subsystems being ready for bot creation.
