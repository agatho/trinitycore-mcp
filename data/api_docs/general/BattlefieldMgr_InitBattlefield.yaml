documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Battlefield management system by setting up all required
    battlegrounds and their configurations.
  description: The InitBattlefield method is responsible for initializing the Battlefield
    Manager subsystem within TrinityCore. This method prepares the system to handle
    battlefield instances, including loading configuration data, registering available
    battleground templates, and setting up internal data structures needed for battlefield
    operations. It typically runs during server startup or when the battleground system
    is first enabled. The method ensures that all necessary resources are allocated
    and configured before any battlefield-related operations can take place. This
    initialization process is crucial for proper functioning of World of Warcraft's
    battleground mechanics within the TrinityCore framework.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: BattlefieldMgr::instance()->InitBattlefield();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. It is
    typically invoked automatically by the core system, but may also be manually called
    in special circumstances. The method performs heavy initialization work including
    database queries and memory allocations, so it should not be called frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times can lead to resource leaks or undefined
    behavior. It must be called before any battlefield operations are attempted. Do
    not invoke this method from within battleground event handlers as it may cause
    deadlocks or inconsistent states.
