documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a game teleport location by its exact name from the object manager's
    internal database.
  description: The GetGameTeleExactName method searches through the internal collection
    of game teleport locations (GameTele objects) stored within the ObjectMgr class
    to find and return a pointer to the specific GameTele entry that matches the provided
    name exactly. This method is used primarily for retrieving teleport coordinates
    and location details for in-game teleports such as cities, instances, or custom
    waypoints. It performs an exact string match against the name field of each GameTele
    entry, making it case-sensitive and requiring precise input. The returned pointer
    will be null if no matching teleport location is found. This method is typically
    called during player teleportation logic when resolving a destination name provided
    by the user or system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a GameTele object if an exact match for the name is
    found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching teleport location exists in the
    database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve teleport location by exact name
    code: "const GameTele* tele = sObjectMgr->GetGameTeleExactName(\"Stormwind City\"\
      );\nif (tele)\n{\n    // Use tele->pos_x, tele->pos_y, tele->pos_z for coordinates\n\
      \    ChatHandler(ch).PSendSysMessage(\"Found teleport to %s at (%f, %f, %f)\"\
      , tele->name.c_str(), tele->pos_x, tele->pos_y, tele->pos_z);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    ChatHandler(ch).SendSysMessage(\"Teleport location not found.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal GameTele list,
    so performance may degrade with large numbers of teleport locations. It is recommended
    to cache frequently accessed teleport entries when possible. The method does not
    perform any locking or thread safety checks internally; callers should ensure
    appropriate synchronization if accessing from multiple threads.
  warnings: The method performs an exact string match, which means it's sensitive
    to capitalization and spacing. For example, "Stormwind City" will not match "stormwind
    city" or "StormwindCity". If the name parameter is empty or contains only whitespace,
    the result will be nullptr.
