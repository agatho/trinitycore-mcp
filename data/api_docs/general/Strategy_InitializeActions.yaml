documentation:
  brief: Initializes all actions associated with the strategy for use in AI decision
    making.
  description: The InitializeActions method prepares and sets up all actions that
    are part of a given strategy. This typically involves configuring action parameters,
    linking actions to appropriate contexts, and ensuring that each action is ready
    for execution during AI processing. The method is usually called once during the
    initialization phase of a strategy object, before the AI system begins making
    decisions based on this strategy. It ensures that all necessary resources are
    allocated and that actions are in a valid state for use by the bot's decision-making
    engine.

  - title: Basic Strategy Initialization
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = new Strategy();

      myStrategy->InitializeActions();

      // Strategy is now ready for AI processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called after the strategy has been configured
    with its actions and before it is used in an AI context. It may perform operations
    such as setting up action priorities, validating action dependencies, or preparing
    internal data structures needed for execution.
