  signature: bool Player::IsMercenaryForBattlegroundQueueType(int bgQueueTypeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is registered as a mercenary for a specific
    battleground queue type.
  description: This method checks if the player is currently marked as a mercenary
    for the specified battleground queue type, which affects their participation in
    battlegrounds. The method returns true if the player is registered as a mercenary
    and false otherwise. This functionality is typically used to determine eligibility
    for certain battleground rewards or to prevent players from entering battlegrounds
    when they are not eligible. The method operates within the context of the World
    of Warcraft battleground system, where mercenary status affects player participation
    in specific queue types.
  parameters:
  - name: bgQueueTypeId
    description: The battleground queue type identifier that determines which queue
      type to check for mercenary status. This is typically a numeric value representing
      a specific battleground queue type such as 0 for Eye of the Storm, 1 for Alterac
      Valley, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the player is registered as a mercenary for the specified
    battleground queue type, false otherwise. The method may return false if the player
    is not registered as a mercenary or if the queue type does not match their current
    mercenary status.
  examples:
  - title: Check Mercenary Status
    code: "bool isMercenary = player->IsMercenaryForBattlegroundQueueType(0);\nif\
      \ (isMercenary)\n{\n    // Player is registered as a mercenary for Eye of the\
      \ Storm\n    // Proceed with appropriate actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking internal player state flags or data
    stored in the player's battleground queue information. It may be used in conjunction
    with other methods like GetBattlegroundQueueType to determine if a player is eligible
    for specific battleground rewards or to prevent players from entering battlegrounds
    when they are not eligible.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually in a battleground
    queue, as calling it outside of this context may result in incorrect behavior.
    Also, this method may not be reliable if the player's mercenary status changes
    during gameplay.
