  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: GetAvailableInterrupters
  signature: int InterruptCoordinatorFixed::GetAvailableInterrupters(const CastingSpellInfo
    & castInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of available interrupters for a given casting
    spell.
  description: The GetAvailableInterrupters method determines how many entities (such
    as players or NPCs) are capable of interrupting a specific spell currently being
    cast. This is typically used in combat systems to evaluate whether an interruption
    attempt can succeed based on the presence and state of potential interrupters.
    The method takes into account the casting spell's properties, such as its duration
    and type, along with the current game context to compute the result. It does not
    modify any internal state but rather provides a read-only calculation result.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the count of available interrupters that could
    potentially interrupt the spell described by castInfo. A return value of zero
    indicates no interrupters are available, while positive values indicate the number
    of valid interrupting entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;\nCastingSpellInfo spellInfo;\n//\
      \ Assume spellInfo is populated with relevant casting data\nint interrupters\
      \ = coordinator.GetAvailableInterrupters(spellInfo);\nif (interrupters > 0)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with interruption logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on the spell's cast state, target validity,
    and entity availability. It may be invoked frequently during combat updates, so
    performance is important. The implementation should avoid heavy computations or
    locking mechanisms to prevent blocking game loop execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the input CastingSpellInfo object is properly initialized
    before calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Also, this
    method assumes a valid game context and should not be called outside of active
    combat scenarios where spell casting is occurring.
