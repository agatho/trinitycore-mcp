  class: Unit
  method: RemovePlayerFromVision
  signature: void Unit::RemovePlayerFromVision(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the unit's vision, effectively hiding the player from
    the unit's sight.
  description: This method removes a player from the Unit's vision by removing the
    player from the unit's visibility list. It is typically used in scenarios where
    a player needs to be hidden from an NPC or creature, such as during stealth operations
    or when a player is no longer visible to the unit. The method ensures that the
    player will not appear in the unit's aggro list or be considered for targeting
    purposes. This functionality is essential for implementing stealth mechanics and
    hiding players from creatures in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that should be removed from the unit's
      vision. The player must be a valid pointer to a Player instance, otherwise the
      method may cause undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      Player* player = new Player;

      unit->RemovePlayerFromVision(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be used carefully as it may affect the unit's behavior
    in combat. It is recommended to ensure that the player object is valid before
    calling this method, otherwise it can lead to memory access violations.
  warnings: This method does not perform any validation checks on the input player
    pointer; calling it with a null pointer or invalid pointer can result in undefined
    behavior or crashes.
