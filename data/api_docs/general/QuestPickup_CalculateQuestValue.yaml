  class: QuestPickup
  method: CalculateQuestValue
  signature: float QuestPickup::CalculateQuestValue(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the value of a quest for a specified player bot.
  description: The CalculateQuestValue method determines the relative worth or utility
    of a given quest for a specific player bot within the TrinityCore framework. This
    calculation typically considers factors such as quest rewards, experience points,
    gold value, and potential item drops. The returned float value represents a normalized
    score that can be used by AI systems to prioritize which quests to accept or pursue.
    The method requires a valid quest identifier and a player object representing
    the bot for whom the value is being calculated.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to evaluate. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for whom the quest
      value is calculated. Must not be null and must represent an active player character.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated quest value. Higher values indicate
    more desirable quests based on the bot's current state and available rewards.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Value Calculation
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      float value = QuestPickup::CalculateQuestValue(questId, myBot);\nif (value >\
      \ 10.0f) {\n    // Consider accepting this quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Quest Value for AI Decision Making
    code: "float bestValue = 0.0f;\nuint32 bestQuestId = 0;\nfor (auto& quest : availableQuests)\
      \ {\n    float value = QuestPickup::CalculateQuestValue(quest.first, bot);\n\
      \    if (value > bestValue) {\n        bestValue = value;\n        bestQuestId\
      \ = quest.first;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestQuestId for quest selection logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and reward calculations, so
    performance may vary depending on the complexity of the quest. It's recommended
    to cache results when evaluating multiple quests in succession.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and represents an active
    bot; passing a null or invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior. The
    method assumes the quest ID exists in the database.
