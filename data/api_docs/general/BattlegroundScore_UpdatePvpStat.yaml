  class: BattlegroundScore
  method: UpdatePvpStat
  signature: void BattlegroundScore::UpdatePvpStat(int pvpStatID, int value)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a player's PvP stat value in the battleground score structure.
  description: The UpdatePvpStat method is used to modify a specific PvP statistic
    for a player within a battleground context. This method updates the internal tracking
    of player performance metrics such as kills, honorable kills, or other battleground-specific
    statistics. It is typically invoked during battleground events when a player earns
    points or performs actions that should be recorded in their score. The method
    directly modifies the BattlegroundScore object's internal state and does not return
    any value. This functionality is crucial for accurately maintaining player statistics
    during PvP encounters and ensuring proper scoring at the end of battlegrounds.
  parameters:
  - name: pvpStatID
    description: The identifier representing the specific PvP statistic to update.
      Valid values correspond to predefined PvP stat types such as kills, honorable
      kills, deaths, etc., typically defined in the PvPStatType enumeration or similar
      structure.
  - name: value
    description: The new value to assign to the specified PvP statistic. This can
      be a positive integer representing an increment or a specific value to set,
      depending on how the method is intended to be used within the battleground scoring
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing Player Kill Count
    code: 'BattlegroundScore score;

      score.UpdatePvpStat(PVP_STAT_KILLS, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Honorable Kill Count
    code: 'BattlegroundScore score;

      score.UpdatePvpStat(PVP_STAT_HONORABLE_KILLS, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground scoring system and should only be
    called when a player's statistics are being updated during an active battleground.
    The pvpStatID parameter must correspond to valid PvP stat types defined in the
    game's internal structures. Modifications made through this method directly affect
    the player's final score displayed at the end of the battleground.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid pvpStatID values may result in undefined
    behavior or corruption of the battleground score data. Ensure that all calls to
    UpdatePvpStat occur within a valid battleground context and are properly synchronized
    if used in multi-threaded environments.
