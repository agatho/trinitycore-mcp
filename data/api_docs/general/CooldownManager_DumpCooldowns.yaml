documentation:
  brief: Dumps all active cooldowns managed by the CooldownManager to the console
    or log output.
  description: The DumpCooldowns method provides a debugging utility that outputs
    all currently active cooldown entries managed by the CooldownManager instance.
    This function is typically used during development or debugging sessions to inspect
    the state of cooldowns for a specific object, such as a player or creature. The
    method iterates through all registered cooldowns and prints relevant information
    including spell IDs, remaining time, and associated targets. It does not modify
    any cooldown states but serves purely for diagnostic purposes. This method is
    usually disabled in production builds to avoid performance overhead.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: "void MyDebugHandler(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetCooldownManager())\n\
      \        player->GetCooldownManager()->DumpCooldowns();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and development environments.
    It may not be available or enabled in release builds of TrinityCore. The output
    format depends on the logging system used by the core, typically appearing in
    the console or log files.
  warnings: Using this method in a production environment may cause performance degradation
    due to logging overhead. Ensure that cooldown dumps are only called during development
    or when explicitly needed for debugging purposes.
