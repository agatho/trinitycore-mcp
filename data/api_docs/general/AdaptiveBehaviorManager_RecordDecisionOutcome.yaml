  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: RecordDecisionOutcome
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::RecordDecisionOutcome(const std::string
    & decision, bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Records the outcome of a decision made by the adaptive behavior manager for
    learning and optimization purposes.
  description: The RecordDecisionOutcome method logs whether a specific decision made
    by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager was successful or not. This functionality is crucial
    for machine learning-based AI systems within TrinityCore, allowing the system
    to adjust its behavior based on past outcomes. The method stores this information
    in an internal data structure that can be used later for analysis, pattern recognition,
    and adaptive decision-making improvements. It does not directly affect gameplay
    mechanics but contributes to the long-term intelligence and responsiveness of
    NPC behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: decision
    description: A string identifier representing the specific decision that was made.
      This should be a unique label or key that identifies the decision context within
      the AI system.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the decision resulted in a successful
      outcome (true) or failure (false). This value determines how the internal learning
      algorithm will adjust future behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recording a Successful Decision
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = ...;

      manager->RecordDecisionOutcome("attack_target", true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a Failed Decision with Conditional Logic
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = ...;

      bool wasSuccessful = someAIAction();

      manager->RecordDecisionOutcome("patrol_route_selection", wasSuccessful);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called after decision-making processes have completed.
    It's designed to be lightweight and non-blocking, making it suitable for frequent
    calls during AI processing. The recorded outcomes are usually stored in memory
    or persisted to a database for later analysis.
  warnings: Ensure that decision identifiers are consistent and meaningful across
    the system to maintain data integrity for learning algorithms. Avoid calling this
    method with empty or invalid decision strings as it may cause issues in subsequent
    analysis.
