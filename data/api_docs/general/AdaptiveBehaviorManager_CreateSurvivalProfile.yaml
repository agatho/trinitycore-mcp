  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::CreateSurvivalProfile()
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new survival profile for adaptive behavior management.
  description: The CreateSurvivalProfile method initializes and sets up a new survival
    profile within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This profile is designed to define
    and manage specific survival-related behaviors and decision-making processes for
    AI-controlled entities in the game world. The method likely configures default
    parameters, initializes internal data structures, and prepares the system for
    adaptive behavior adjustments based on environmental conditions or player interactions.
    It serves as a foundational step before any survival-specific AI logic can be
    executed.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = new AdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      manager->CreateSurvivalProfile();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during the initialization phase of an AI entity's
    lifecycle to ensure proper setup of survival behaviors. The created profile may
    be modified later through other methods in the AdaptiveBehaviorManager class.
