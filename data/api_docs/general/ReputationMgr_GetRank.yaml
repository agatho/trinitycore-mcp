  class: ReputationMgr
  method: GetRank
  signature: int ReputationMgr::GetRank(const FactionEntry * factionEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation rank for a specified faction entry.
  description: The GetRank method returns the current reputation rank of the player
    for a given faction. This rank is determined based on the player's standing with
    the faction and corresponds to predefined reputation levels such as Hated, Hostile,
    Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Honored, Revered, and Exalted. The method takes
    a FactionEntry pointer as input which defines the faction for which the rank is
    being queried. This functionality is essential for determining how the player
    interacts with NPCs and quests related to that faction.
  parameters:
  - name: factionEntry
    description: A pointer to the FactionEntry structure representing the faction
      whose reputation rank is to be retrieved. Must not be null.
  returns: An integer value representing the reputation rank of the player for the
    specified faction. The possible values typically range from 0 (Hated) to 7 (Exalted),
    though exact values may vary depending on the game's internal reputation system
    implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Get Reputation Rank for a Faction
    code: "const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1118); // Example\
      \ faction ID\nint rank = player->GetReputationMgr().GetRank(faction);\nif (rank\
      \ >= 5) {\n    // Player is at least Revered with this faction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal reputation tracking system of TrinityCore.
    The returned rank value should be used in conjunction with other reputation-related
    methods to fully understand a player's standing with a faction. Performance is
    generally good as it only accesses cached data.
  warnings: Ensure that the FactionEntry pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Also note that the rank value returned
    may be affected by in-game events or quest completion that modify reputation.
