  class: CollectionMgr
  method: MountSetFavorite
  signature: void CollectionMgr::MountSetFavorite(uint32 spellId, bool favorite)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the favorite status of a mount in the player's collection.
  description: The MountSetFavorite method updates the favorite status of a specific
    mount identified by its spell ID within the player's collection. This functionality
    allows players to mark their preferred mounts for easier access or organization.
    The method modifies internal data structures that track which mounts are marked
    as favorites, typically persisting this information across sessions. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with UI elements that display favorite mounts or when implementing
    custom mount management features.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier (spell ID) of the mount to set as favorite
      or not. This must correspond to a valid mount spell known to the player.
  - name: favorite
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the mount should be marked as favorite
      (true) or removed from favorites (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Mark a Mount as Favorite
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->MountSetFavorite(12345, true); // Mark mount with spell ID 12345
      as favorite'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Mount from Favorites
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->MountSetFavorite(67890, false); // Remove mount with spell ID
      67890 from favorites'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers updates to the player's collection data and may
    synchronize changes with the client-side UI. It should only be called for mounts
    that are already known to the player, otherwise it might have no effect or cause
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid spell ID (one not associated with
    a known mount) may result in silent failure or undefined behavior. Ensure the
    spell ID corresponds to a valid and learned mount before calling.
