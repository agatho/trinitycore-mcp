  class: Unit
  method: SetFeared
  signature: void Unit::SetFeared(bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit's feared state to apply or remove fear effects.
  description: The SetFeared method controls whether a unit is under the effect of
    fear mechanics in World of Warcraft. When applied, it causes the unit to enter
    a state where they cannot move or attack, typically resulting in the unit running
    away from their current target. This method is used primarily for managing fear
    effects on NPCs and players during combat situations. The implementation involves
    setting internal flags that affect movement and behavior, and can be toggled on/off
    based on the boolean parameter provided.
  parameters:
  - name: apply
    description: Determines whether to apply or remove the fear effect. True will
      set the unit into a feared state, false will remove it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n    target->SetFeared(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with conditional logic
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\n{\n    target->SetFeared(false);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    target->SetFeared(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the unit's movement behavior and can be used
    to control NPC AI behavior during combat. It should be used carefully as it may
    interfere with normal gameplay mechanics if not handled properly.
  warnings: Improper use of SetFeared can cause units to become stuck in fear state,
    leading to potential game-breaking situations where they cannot move or attack
    normally. Always ensure that the unit is properly reset after applying fear effects.
