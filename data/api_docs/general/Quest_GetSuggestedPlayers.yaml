documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of suggested players for the quest
  description: The GetSuggestedPlayers method retrieves the count of players that
    are suggested to be involved in a specific quest. This value represents how many
    players should be involved in the quest based on its design and mechanics. The
    method is typically used by the game engine to determine how many players should
    participate in a quest's completion or to validate player participation. It does
    not directly return a list of players but rather the count of suggested players,
    which can be useful for quest tracking and player interaction validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of suggested players for
    the quest. This value is typically used to determine how many players should participate
    in the quest's completion or to validate player participation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 suggestedPlayers = quest->GetSuggestedPlayers();\n// Use suggestedPlayers\
      \ to determine player participation\nif (suggestedPlayers > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and is used primarily for game mechanics
    validation. It should be called in contexts where player participation needs to
    be validated or tracked. The value returned by this method is typically determined
    by the quest's design and may vary based on the quest's parameters.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly retrieve player data, as it
    only returns the count of suggested players. It's important to understand that
    this value does not necessarily represent actual player participation but rather
    the suggested number of players for the quest.
