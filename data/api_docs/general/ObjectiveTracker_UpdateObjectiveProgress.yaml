  method: UpdateObjectiveProgress
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateObjectiveProgress(Player * bot, ObjectiveState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the progress state of an objective for a player in the objective
    tracker system.
  description: The UpdateObjectiveProgress method is responsible for updating the
    current state of a specific objective assigned to a player within the TrinityCore's
    objective tracking system. This method typically handles the logic required to
    advance or modify the progress of objectives such as quest progress, achievement
    completion, or other tracked in-game events. It ensures that the player's objective
    data is synchronized with the game state and may trigger updates to the user interface
    or related systems. The method operates on a provided Player object and an ObjectiveState
    structure which contains the current progress and status information for the objective.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objective progress is being updated.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player instance
      in the game world.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to an ObjectiveState structure containing the current progress
      and status information for the objective. This structure holds data about how
      much progress has been made, whether it's completed, and other relevant metadata
      for tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player instance

      ObjectiveState currentState;

      currentState.progress = 50;

      currentState.completed = false;

      objectiveTracker->UpdateObjectiveProgress(player, currentState);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Quest Objective Progress
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ObjectiveState questState;

      questState.progress = player->GetQuestStatus(12345);

      questState.completed = player->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE;

      objectiveTracker->UpdateObjectiveProgress(player, questState);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when objective
    progress changes, but can also be invoked manually for custom behavior. The method
    may trigger UI updates or other systems that depend on objective states. It's
    important to ensure that the Player object and ObjectiveState are valid before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'bot' parameter will likely cause a crash.
    Ensure that the ObjectiveState contains valid data, especially when dealing with
    progress values that may exceed expected limits or be negative.
