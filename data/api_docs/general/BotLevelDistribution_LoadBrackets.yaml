  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: LoadBrackets
  signature: void BotLevelDistribution::LoadBrackets(int faction, const std::string
    & prefix)
documentation:
  brief: Loads level distribution brackets for bot behavior based on faction and prefix
    configuration.
  description: The LoadBrackets method initializes and configures level distribution
    brackets used by the bot system in TrinityCore. It reads configuration data related
    to bot levels, typically stored in a configuration file or database, and organizes
    this data into internal structures for use during bot creation and gameplay. The
    method takes a faction identifier and a prefix string to determine which configuration
    entries should be loaded, allowing for different level distributions for different
    factions or bot types. This method is essential for ensuring that bots are created
    with appropriate levels based on their faction and role within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: faction
    description: The faction identifier (e.g., 0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) used to
      determine which level brackets should be loaded. Valid values typically correspond
      to known faction IDs in the TrinityCore database.
  - name: prefix
    description: A string prefix used to filter configuration entries related to bot
      level distribution. This allows for multiple sets of brackets to be defined
      with different prefixes (e.g., 'bot_level_', 'npc_level_') for different bot
      types or scenarios.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load brackets for Alliance bots
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution levelDist;

      levelDist.LoadBrackets(0, "bot_level_alliance_");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Load brackets for Horde bots with custom prefix
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution levelDist;

      levelDist.LoadBrackets(1, "custom_bot_levels_");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when a new
    bot configuration needs to be loaded. It assumes that the configuration system
    is already initialized and that the specified prefix exists in the configuration
    database. The loaded brackets are used by other methods in the BotLevelDistribution
    class to determine appropriate bot levels based on faction and context.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the configuration
    system may result in incomplete or incorrect bracket loading. Ensure that the
    provided faction ID and prefix match existing configuration entries to avoid runtime
    errors or unexpected behavior.
