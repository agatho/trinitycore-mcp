  brief: Sets the favorite mount for the player based on the provided mount ID and
    slot.
  description: The HandleMountSetFavorite method processes a client request to set
    or update the favorite mount for a player. This functionality allows players to
    designate a specific mount as their preferred one, which can be used in various
    game contexts such as quick mounting or UI display. The method handles validation
    of the mount ID and slot, ensuring that only valid mounts can be marked as favorites.
    It also updates internal player data structures to reflect the new favorite mount
    setting.

  - name: mountSetFavorite
    description: A packet containing information about the mount to set as favorite,
      including the mount ID and slot index.

  notes: This method is part of the WorldSession class and is typically invoked when

    the provided mount ID exists in the player's collection and that the slot index
    is valid.
