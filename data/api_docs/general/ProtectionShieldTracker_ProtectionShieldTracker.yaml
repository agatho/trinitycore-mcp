documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ProtectionShieldTracker class.
  description: The ProtectionShieldTracker constructor initializes the internal state
    of the protection shield tracking system. This method sets up default values for
    tracking protection shields applied to players or units within the TrinityCore
    framework. It prepares the object for monitoring and managing shield-related game
    mechanics such as damage absorption, shield duration, and shield stacking behaviors.
    The initialization typically occurs when a new shield tracker is created for a
    specific unit or player context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ProtectionShieldTracker instance
    code: 'ProtectionShieldTracker* shieldTracker = new ProtectionShieldTracker();

      // The object is now initialized and ready to track protection shields'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization logic. It primarily
    sets up internal data structures required for tracking protection shields. Developers
    should ensure that shield trackers are properly destroyed when no longer needed
    to prevent memory leaks.
