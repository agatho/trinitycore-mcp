documentation:
  brief: Adjusts AI strategy parameters for a specific bot based on performance feedback
  description: The AdjustStrategyParameters method modifies the decision-making logic
    and behavior of a specific bot within the TrinityCore AI system. It takes a bot's
    unique identifier and performance feedback to dynamically tune its strategic parameters,
    such as aggression levels, targeting preferences, or movement patterns. This method
    is typically invoked when the AI system needs to adapt its behavior based on observed
    performance metrics or external feedback mechanisms. The adjustment process may
    involve recalibrating internal weights, modifying decision thresholds, or updating
    behavioral states to improve overall bot performance and gameplay experience.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose strategy parameters
      need to be adjusted. This value must correspond to a valid active bot within
      the AI system.
  - name: feedback
    description: Performance feedback value that influences parameter adjustments.
      Positive values typically indicate improved performance, while negative values
      suggest suboptimal behavior. The exact interpretation depends on the AI implementation
      and feedback scoring system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Adjustment
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      int feedback = -10;

      optimizer.AdjustStrategyParameters(botGuid, feedback);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic AI Tuning Based on Combat Results
    code: "void OnBotCombatEnd(uint32_t botGuid, bool victory) {\n    int feedback\
      \ = victory ? 5 : -15;\n    PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;\n    optimizer.AdjustStrategyParameters(botGuid,\
      \ feedback);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an adaptive AI system that continuously learns and
    improves bot behavior. The actual parameter adjustments depend on the internal
    strategy implementation and may involve complex mathematical operations or machine
    learning algorithms. The method should only be called for bots that are currently
    active and managed by the PerformanceOptimizer.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid may result in undefined behavior
    or system instability. Ensure that the bot exists and is properly initialized
    before invoking this method. Frequent calls with extreme feedback values might
    cause abrupt changes in bot behavior, potentially affecting gameplay balance.
