  class: LoSUtils
  method: GetVerticalClearance
  signature: float LoSUtils::GetVerticalClearance(const int & pos, Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the vertical clearance distance for a given position within a
    map.
  description: The GetVerticalClearance method computes the maximum vertical distance
    from a specified position to the ground or lowest obstacle in the map. This utility
    is commonly used in pathfinding, line-of-sight calculations, and determining whether
    an object can pass through a given space without collision. The method takes into
    account the map's height data and any applicable terrain or object boundaries
    to return a float value representing the clearance in game units. It assumes the
    position is valid and within the bounds of the provided map.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The vertical position (Y coordinate) to evaluate for clearance. This
      represents the height at which clearance is measured, typically relative to
      the map's ground level.
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the clearance calculation will be
      performed. The method uses this map's terrain data and collision information
      to determine vertical clearance.
  returns: A float value representing the vertical clearance distance in game units,
    measured from the specified position down to the nearest solid surface or obstacle.
    Returns zero if no clearance is found or if an error occurs during calculation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetVerticalClearance
    code: float clearance = LoSUtils::GetVerticalClearance(100, map);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using vertical clearance for pathfinding decision
    code: "if (LoSUtils::GetVerticalClearance(playerPosition.GetY(), playerMap) >\
      \ 5.0f)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Avoid this area\
      \ due to insufficient clearance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate map data and collision detection systems.
    Performance may vary depending on the complexity of the terrain and number of
    obstacles in the vicinity of the evaluated position. Ensure that the provided
    map pointer is valid before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null map pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or a crash. Always verify that the map object is initialized
    and accessible before invoking GetVerticalClearance.
