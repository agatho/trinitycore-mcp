  class: SpellDestination
  method: SpellDestination
  signature: void SpellDestination::SpellDestination(const WorldObject & wObj)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SpellDestination object with the position and orientation of
    the provided WorldObject.
  description: The SpellDestination constructor initializes the destination properties
    of a spell based on the given WorldObject's location and orientation. This is
    commonly used in spell casting mechanics to determine where a spell should be
    cast or where its effects should originate from. The method copies the target's
    position data, including coordinates and facing direction, into the internal destination
    structure for use during spell execution. It ensures that spells can accurately
    target or originate from dynamic objects such as players, creatures, or game objects
    within the World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters:
  - name: wObj
    description: Reference to the WorldObject whose position and orientation will
      be used to initialize the SpellDestination. This object must be valid and have
      a defined location in the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize SpellDestination from Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid

      SpellDestination dest(*player);

      // dest now contains the player''s position and orientation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SpellDestination in Spell Casting Context
    code: 'Unit* caster = ...; // Assume caster is valid

      SpellDestination dest(*caster);

      // Used to set spell target destination before casting

      WorldObject* target = ...;

      Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, target, SpellInfo);

      spell->prepare(&dest);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the WorldObject's position data.
    The SpellDestination object will reference the same memory location for position
    data as the original WorldObject, so any changes to the WorldObject's position
    after initialization may affect the destination unless explicitly updated.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided WorldObject is valid and not destroyed before
    the SpellDestination is used in spell execution. Using an invalid or destroyed
    WorldObject can lead to undefined behavior or crashes during spell processing.
