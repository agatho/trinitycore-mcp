  class: SocialStrategy
  method: SocialStrategy
  signature: void SocialStrategy::SocialStrategy(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new social strategy instance with the specified name.
  description: The SocialStrategy constructor initializes a new social strategy object
    with the provided name. This method sets up the internal state of the social strategy,
    which is used by the AI system to determine how NPCs should interact socially
    with players and other NPCs. The name parameter serves as an identifier for the
    strategy type, allowing different social behaviors to be configured and selected
    based on context. This constructor is typically called during NPC creation or
    AI initialization when a specific social behavior pattern needs to be assigned.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The unique identifier name for this social strategy instance. This
      string is used internally to categorize and select appropriate social behaviors
      for the AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Social Strategy Instance
    code: 'SocialStrategy strategy("FriendlyNPC");

      // Initializes a new social strategy with name ''FriendlyNPC'''
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Different Social Strategies
    code: 'SocialStrategy neutralStrategy("NeutralNPC");

      SocialStrategy hostileStrategy("HostileNPC");

      // Creates two distinct social strategies for different NPC behaviors'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the AI strategy pattern implementation in TrinityCore.
    The name parameter should be unique to distinguish between different social behavior
    patterns. The actual social behavior logic is implemented in derived classes or
    through associated strategy methods.
