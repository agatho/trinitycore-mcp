  brief: Applies sanctuary effect to the target, preventing all attacks and spells
    from being cast on the target.
  description: The EffectSanctuary method implements a protective mechanism that prevents
    the target from being attacked or targeted by any hostile actions. This effect
    typically disables all forms of offensive spells and abilities targeting the affected
    unit, making it immune to damage and status effects. The method is commonly used
    in conjunction with other defensive spells to create a temporary sanctuary state
    where the target cannot be engaged by enemies.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other defensive spells
    to create a sanctuary state. Implementation requires careful handling of target
    selection and effects to ensure proper execution.
  warnings: Improper implementation may cause the target to remain vulnerable to attacks
    or may not properly disable all offensive actions, potentially leading to game
    balance issues.
