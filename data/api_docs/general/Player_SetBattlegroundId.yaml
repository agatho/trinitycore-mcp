documentation:
  brief: Sets the battleground ID for a player, updating their current battleground
    state.
  description: This method updates the player's battleground identifier and related
    information within the game world. It is used to assign a specific battleground
    instance to a player, typically during matchmaking or when entering a battleground.
    The method handles the internal tracking of battleground IDs and queue positions,
    ensuring proper synchronization with the game's battleground system. This function
    should be called when a player enters a battleground or when their battleground
    state changes.

    description: The battleground ID to set for the player. This represents the unique
      identifier of the specific battleground instance.
  - name: bgTypeId
    description: The type ID of the battleground being assigned. This determines which
      battleground type the player is participating in, such as 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3.
  - name: queueId
    description: The queue ID that corresponds to the battleground instance. This
      indicates the specific queue position within the battleground system.
  returns: null

  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground tracking system and should
    only be called when a player enters a battleground. It updates the player's current
    battleground state and may affect their status in the queue.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause synchronization issues with the
    battleground system, leading to incorrect player status or game state problems.
