  method: AnalyzeLootValue
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::AnalyzeLootValue(Group * group, uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the value of loot items within a group context for instance coordination
    purposes.
  description: The AnalyzeLootValue method evaluates the worth of a specific item
    within the context of a group's loot distribution. This function is typically
    used in instance coordination systems to determine how valuable or significant
    an item is to the group, potentially affecting loot assignment strategies, priority
    settings, or reward distribution. The method takes a pointer to a Group object
    and a uint32 representing the item ID to analyze. It likely performs internal
    calculations or lookups based on item properties, group composition, and instance-specific
    rules to assess the item's value.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the loot value is being analyzed.
      This represents the group of players who may receive the item.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the item whose value is being assessed.
      This ID corresponds to an entry in the game's item database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic loot value analysis for a group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 itemId = 12345;

      instanceCoordination->AnalyzeLootValue(myGroup, itemId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger loot coordination system that manages
    how items are distributed among group members in instances. It may interact with
    internal databases or caches to determine item values based on factors such as
    item level, rarity, and group member roles.
