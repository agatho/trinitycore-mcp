documentation:
  brief: Adds a creature member to the creature group
  description: The AddMember method integrates a specified Creature object into the
    current creature group, establishing a relationship between the group and its
    constituent members. This functionality is essential for managing creature behavior
    in groups such as patrols, formations, or coordinated attacks. The method typically
    updates internal data structures to track group membership and may trigger associated
    AI behaviors or events. It's commonly used during creature initialization or when
    dynamically modifying group composition during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: member
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will be added to this creature
      group. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CreatureGroup* group = new CreatureGroup();

      Creature* creature = ...; // Obtain a valid Creature pointer

      group->AddMember(creature);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Members
    code: "CreatureGroup* group = new CreatureGroup();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n\
      {\n    Creature* creature = ...; // Get or spawn a creature\n    group->AddMember(creature);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Creature pointer is valid and properly
    initialized. The internal implementation likely updates linked lists or containers
    to maintain group membership. It may also notify other systems about the new member,
    such as AI subsystems or event handlers.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all Creature pointers passed are valid before
    calling AddMember.
