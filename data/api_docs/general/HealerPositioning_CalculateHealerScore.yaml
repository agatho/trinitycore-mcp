  class: HealerPositioning
  method: CalculateHealerScore
  signature: float HealerPositioning::CalculateHealerScore(const int & pos, const
    CombatPositionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a heuristic score for optimal healer positioning based on combat
    context and position.
  description: The CalculateHealerScore method evaluates a given position within a
    combat scenario to determine its suitability for a healer's placement. It considers
    factors such as proximity to injured allies, line of sight to targets, and overall
    battlefield dynamics. The method returns a floating-point value representing the
    quality of the specified position, where higher scores indicate better positioning
    for effective healing. This function is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    for healer NPCs or player-controlled healers in TrinityCore's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the combat
      environment. This value usually corresponds to a grid cell or coordinate within
      the game world's spatial mapping system.
  - name: context
    description: A CombatPositionContext object containing relevant data about the
      current combat situation, including target positions, ally health states, and
      environmental factors that influence positioning decisions.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated score for the given position.
    Higher scores indicate more optimal healer positioning, with values typically
    ranging from 0.0 (worst) to 1.0 (best), though exact ranges may vary based on
    implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float score = healerPositioning.CalculateHealerScore(42, combatContext);\n\
      if (score > 0.7f) {\n    // Position is considered good for healing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding Best Position
    code: "float bestScore = 0.0f;\nint bestPosition = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalPositions;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float score = healerPositioning.CalculateHealerScore(i, combatContext);\n\
      \    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n        bestPosition\
      \ = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPosition for healer movement"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex spatial calculations and may involve
    multiple factors such as distance to injured allies, threat levels from enemies,
    and visibility constraints. The exact scoring algorithm is implementation-specific
    but generally aims to maximize healing effectiveness while minimizing risk to
    the healer.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; passing invalid position identifiers
    or malformed context objects could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    Ensure that the CombatPositionContext contains up-to-date information for accurate
    positioning decisions.
