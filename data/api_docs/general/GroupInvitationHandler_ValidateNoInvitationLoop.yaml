documentation:
  brief: Validates that inviting a player will not create a group invitation loop.
  description: The ValidateNoInvitationLoop method checks whether inviting a player
    to a group would result in a circular reference or loop within the group invitation
    system. This prevents scenarios where players might indirectly invite each other
    in a way that could cause infinite loops or invalid group states. The method typically
    examines the current group membership and pending invitations to ensure no such
    loops exist before allowing an invitation to proceed. It is used internally by
    the group management system to maintain data integrity and prevent logical errors
    in group formation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if no invitation loop would be created by inviting the player
    with the given GUID; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group invitation validation
    code: "if (groupInvitationHandler.ValidateNoInvitationLoop(inviterGuid)) {\n \
      \   // Proceed with invitation\n    group->AddMember(player);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Handle loop detection\n    SendGroupOperationResult(false, \"Cannot invite\
      \ player - would create a loop\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is crucial for maintaining the integrity of group invitations
    in TrinityCore. It likely uses a graph traversal algorithm to detect cycles in
    the invitation chain. The implementation may cache previous checks or maintain
    state about current invitations to avoid redundant computations.
  warnings: Do not call this method without first ensuring that the inviter GUID is
    valid and corresponds to an active player. Calling this method with invalid GUIDs
    could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect loop detection results.
