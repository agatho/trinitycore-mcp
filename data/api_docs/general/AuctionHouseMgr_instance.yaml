  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AuctionHouseMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AuctionHouseMgr
    class, providing global access to the auction house management system. This method
    ensures that only one instance of the auction house manager exists throughout
    the game server's lifecycle. The returned pointer can be used to access all auction
    house related functionality including item listing, bidding, and auction processing.
    This is a thread-safe implementation that guarantees consistent access to the
    auction house data structure across different parts of the TrinityCore codebase.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of AuctionHouseMgr. The method never
    returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Auction House Manager
    code: 'AuctionHouseMgr* auctionHouse = AuctionHouseMgr::instance();

      // Use auctionHouse pointer to access auction functionality

      uint32 auctionCount = auctionHouse->GetAuctionCount();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Auction House in Game Logic
    code: "void ProcessPlayerAuction(AuctionHouseMgr* ahMgr, Player* player)\n{\n\
      \    // Access the singleton instance\n    AuctionHouseMgr* auctionHouse = AuctionHouseMgr::instance();\n\
      \    \n    // Perform auction-related operations\n    if (auctionHouse->HasAuctions(player->GetGUID()))\n\
      \    {\n        // Handle player's auctions\n        auctionHouse->UpdateAuctions();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The AuctionHouseMgr instance is typically created during server startup and destroyed
    at shutdown. The implementation is thread-safe as it's designed to be accessed
    from multiple threads concurrently without requiring additional synchronization.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances or manually
    managing the lifetime of the returned pointer. The method should only be called
    after the server has properly initialized the auction house system, otherwise
    unexpected behavior may occur.
