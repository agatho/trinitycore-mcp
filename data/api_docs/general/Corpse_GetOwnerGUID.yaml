  method: GetOwnerGUID
  signature: int Corpse::GetOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who owns this corpse.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the Game Object ID (GUID) of the
    player whose corpse this object represents. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, corpses are created when players die and contain various data
    including the owner's identity. This method allows scripts, AI systems, or game
    logic to identify which player's body a particular corpse belongs to. The returned
    GUID can be used to locate the player in the world, check their status, or perform
    operations such as resurrection or loot distribution. It is important to note
    that this method will return 0 if the corpse has no valid owner, which may occur
    in special circumstances like temporary or invalid corpses.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the player who owns this corpse. Returns
    0 if there is no valid owner associated with the corpse.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Corpse Owner
    code: "Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume we have a valid corpse pointer\nuint64\
      \ ownerGUID = corpse->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGUID != 0)\n{\n    Player* owner\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ownerGUID);\n    if (owner)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Perform actions with the owner player object\n        sLog->outString(\"Corpse\
      \ belongs to player: %s\", owner->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer()
    or similar functions to retrieve the actual Player object from the GUID. The returned
    value is a full GUID including the low part and high part, but for some internal
    operations it may be treated as an integer type. Performance-wise, this is a fast
    lookup operation since the GUID is stored directly within the Corpse object.
  warnings: Ensure that the corpse pointer being used is valid before calling GetOwnerGUID(),
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause a crash. Also note that in rare cases
    where a corpse has been corrupted or improperly initialized, this method might
    return 0 even if a player should logically own it.
