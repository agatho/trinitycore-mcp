  class: BotPriorityManager
  method: RecordUpdateStart
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::RecordUpdateStart(int botGuid, uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records the start time of a bot priority update for the specified bot GUID.
  description: The RecordUpdateStart method logs the beginning of a priority update
    cycle for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore bot management system to track when bot behavior priorities
    are being recalculated or modified. It accepts a bot's unique identifier and the
    current timestamp, storing this information for potential use in performance monitoring,
    debugging, or synchronization purposes. The method does not return any value but
    updates internal tracking structures related to bot priority management.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose update start is being
      recorded. This value should correspond to a valid bot entry in the database.
  - name: currentTime
    description: The current Unix timestamp indicating when the update process began.
      This value is typically obtained from the system clock or game time source.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      uint32 currentTime = time(nullptr);

      manager->RecordUpdateStart(12345, currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal tracking mechanism for bot behavior
    updates. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like RecordUpdateEnd
    to measure update durations or detect performance bottlenecks.
