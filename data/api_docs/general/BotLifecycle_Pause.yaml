  class: BotLifecycle
  method: Pause
  signature: void BotLifecycle::Pause()
documentation:
  brief: Pauses the bot's lifecycle execution and halts all active bot behaviors.
  description: The Pause method suspends the current execution state of a bot within
    the TrinityCore framework. When invoked, it stops all ongoing activities such
    as movement, spell casting, and AI decision-making for the bot. This method is
    typically used to temporarily disable a bot's behavior without fully terminating
    its existence in the game world. The bot remains in the game but becomes inactive
    until explicitly resumed via the corresponding Resume method. This functionality
    is essential for managing bot states during debugging, testing, or when integrating
    with other systems that require temporary suspension of AI behaviors.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pause Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycle* bot = GetBotByGUID(guid);

      bot->Pause();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pause with State Check
    code: "if (bot->IsRunning()) {\n    bot->Pause();\n    // Bot is now paused\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not destroy or remove the bot from memory; it simply suspends
    its active processing. The bot's state is preserved, including its position, health,
    and any assigned tasks. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction with
    Resume() to properly manage bot lifecycle transitions.
  warnings: Calling Pause() on a bot that is already paused may have undefined behavior
    or no effect depending on implementation details. Always verify the current state
    before invoking Pause() if strict control over execution flow is required.
