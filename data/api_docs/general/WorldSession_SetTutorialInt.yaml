  class: WorldSession
  method: SetTutorialInt
  signature: void WorldSession::SetTutorialInt(uint8 index, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a tutorial integer value at the specified index for the current session.
  description: The SetTutorialInt method allows setting a 32-bit integer value at
    a specific index within the player's tutorial data. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft to track various tutorial progress states or flags for
    individual players. The method directly modifies the internal tutorial data structure
    associated with the WorldSession instance, which persists during the player's
    session. Tutorial data is often utilized to control quest visibility, NPC interactions,
    and other gameplay elements that depend on player progression through initial
    tutorials.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The index position in the tutorial data array where the value will
      be stored. Valid values are typically between 0-127, though exact range depends
      on internal implementation and client expectations.
  - name: value
    description: The 32-bit unsigned integer value to store at the specified index.
      This can represent various tutorial states, flags, or progress indicators depending
      on how the game logic interprets each index.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Tutorial Progress Flag
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      // Mark tutorial step 5 as completed

      session->SetTutorialInt(5, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Tutorial States
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      // Set multiple tutorial flags at once

      session->SetTutorialInt(0, 1); // Tutorial started

      session->SetTutorialInt(1, 1); // First objective completed

      session->SetTutorialInt(2, 1); // Second objective completed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies session-local tutorial data. Changes are not
    persisted to the database unless explicitly saved by other systems. The tutorial
    data is typically reset when a player logs out or when a new character is created.
    The index parameter should be carefully validated to prevent out-of-bounds access,
    though internal bounds checking may occur.
  warnings: Incorrect index values could lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption
    if they exceed the allocated tutorial data array size. This method should not
    be called with invalid indices without proper bounds checking. Be cautious when
    modifying tutorial flags that affect gameplay mechanics as this can break quest
    progression or NPC interactions.
