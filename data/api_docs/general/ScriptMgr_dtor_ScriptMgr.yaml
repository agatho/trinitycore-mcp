documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ScriptMgr instance and cleans up all associated script resources.
  description: The ScriptMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    script-related resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the ScriptMgr
    singleton. This includes unregistering all registered scripts, freeing memory
    associated with script handlers, and ensuring no dangling references remain in
    the system. The destructor is automatically invoked when the TrinityCore server
    shuts down or when the ScriptMgr instance is explicitly destroyed. It ensures
    that all script callbacks are properly unregistered and that the scripting environment
    is left in a clean state to prevent memory leaks or undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at server shutdown
    code: '// The ScriptMgr destructor is automatically called during server shutdown

      // No explicit code needed to invoke it

      // All scripts are cleaned up automatically'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is part of the singleton pattern implementation for ScriptMgr.
    It should never be called directly by user code as it's managed by the TrinityCore
    framework. The destruction process ensures all script callbacks are properly unregistered
    to prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers.
