  brief: Award credit for killing a game object with specified entry
  description: The KillCreditGO method is used to grant quest credit when a player
    kills a game object identified by its entry number. This method allows players
    to receive credit for defeating specific game objects, which may be required for
    completing certain quests or achieving objectives within the World of Warcraft
    environment. The method takes into account both the entry number of the game object
    and an optional GUID parameter that can be used to identify specific instances
    of the object.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The entry ID of the game object that was killed, which determines
      the quest credit awarded
  - name: guid
    description: Optional GUID parameter used to identify specific instances of the
      game object, allowing for precise credit tracking
  returns: null

  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 entry = 12345;

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest completion mechanics
    and may be called from various game object scripts or combat scenarios. The method
    should be used carefully as it affects quest progression and player advancement.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest progression or
    missing credit, potentially preventing players from completing required objectives.
    Ensure that the entry parameter matches the actual game object being killed.
