api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: HasCompletedPrerequisiteQuests
  signature: bool QuestValidation::HasCompletedPrerequisiteQuests(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player has completed all prerequisite quests required for
    a specified quest.
  description: The HasCompletedPrerequisiteQuests method evaluates if a given player
    has fulfilled all the prerequisite quest requirements necessary to begin or progress
    with a specific quest. This validation is crucial in World of Warcraft's quest
    system, ensuring that players follow the intended questing order and do not bypass
    required steps. The method typically checks for completed quests in the player's
    quest log and verifies that their completion status meets the prerequisites defined
    in the quest template. It returns true if all prerequisites are satisfied, false
    otherwise. This function is commonly used during quest acceptance, quest progression,
    or when determining if a player can interact with certain quest-related NPCs or
    objects.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which prerequisite completion
      is being checked. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game's quest database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      prerequisites are being validated. This parameter must not be null and should
      reference an active player character.
  returns: Returns true if all prerequisite quests for the specified questId have
    been completed by the player, false otherwise. If the questId does not exist or
    has no prerequisites defined, it returns true as there are no requirements to
    fulfill.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->HasCompletedPrerequisiteQuests(12345, player)) {\n\
      \    // Player can proceed with quest 12345\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n\
      } else {\n    // Player lacks required prerequisites\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You must complete the prerequisite quests first.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (!sQuestValidation->HasCompletedPrerequisiteQuests(questId,\
      \ player)) {\n        player->SendQuestInvalidReason(questId, QUEST_INVALID_REASON_MISSING_PREREQUISITES);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n\
      \    player->AddQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current quest log and completion status.
    It may not account for quests that are marked as complete but not yet saved to
    the database. The implementation likely caches prerequisite data for performance
    reasons, so changes to quest prerequisites during runtime might not be immediately
    reflected. This function is typically used in conjunction with other quest validation
    methods to ensure proper quest progression.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and the questId exists before
    calling this method, as invalid parameters can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency operations, as it may involve
    database queries or complex checks that could impact performance if called excessively
    without proper caching.
