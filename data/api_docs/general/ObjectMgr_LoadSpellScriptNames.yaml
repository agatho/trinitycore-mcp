  method: LoadSpellScriptNames
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadSpellScriptNames()
documentation:
  brief: Loads spell script names from the database into memory for use in spell handling.
  description: The LoadSpellScriptNames method initializes and populates the internal
    mapping of spell IDs to their corresponding script names. This allows the game
    engine to associate specific scripted behavior with spells during runtime. The
    method typically executes during server startup or database reload operations,
    reading data from the 'spell_script_names' table in the database. It ensures that
    all spells defined with custom scripts are properly registered and can be executed
    when triggered by players or game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    sObjectMgr->LoadSpellScriptNames();\n    // Continue with other systems...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reloads.
    It's important that the database table 'spell_script_names' contains valid spell
    IDs and script names, otherwise spell scripts may fail to load properly. The method
    does not return any status information, so errors are generally logged internally.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started with loaded spells may
    cause inconsistencies in spell behavior. It should only be invoked during initialization
    or controlled reload scenarios. If the database table is malformed or missing
    entries, some spells might lose their scripted functionality.
