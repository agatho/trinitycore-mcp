documentation:
  brief: Resets all position-related metrics and counters within the PositionManager
    instance.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and resets all internal metrics and
    tracking data associated with position management. This includes resetting counters,
    timers, and any statistical data that tracks position-related activities such
    as updates, validations, or movement events. The method ensures a clean state
    for subsequent operations and is typically called when reinitializing or resetting
    the position manager's tracking capabilities. It does not affect the actual position
    data itself, only the accumulated metrics used for monitoring and debugging purposes.

  notes: This method should be used carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve clearing internal data structures. It is recommended to call this
    method during initialization or reset phases of the position manager's lifecycle.
