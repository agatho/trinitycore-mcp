  brief: Initializes the reset time for random battlegrounds

    and made available for new matches. The method is typically called during server
    initialization or when resetting battleground configurations. This ensures that
    players can join random battlegrounds according to the configured schedule and
    prevents immediate re-joining of recently completed matches.
