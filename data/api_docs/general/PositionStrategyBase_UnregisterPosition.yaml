  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: UnregisterPosition
  signature: void PositionStrategyBase::UnregisterPosition(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player bot from the position strategy's tracking list.
  description: The UnregisterPosition method removes a specified Player bot from the
    internal tracking structure of the PositionStrategyBase class. This method is
    typically used when a bot is no longer needed for position-based calculations
    or strategies, such as when the bot logs out, is destroyed, or is removed from
    a group. It ensures that the strategy no longer considers this player in its positioning
    logic and cleans up any associated resources or references. The operation is generally
    performed during cleanup or state change events within the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to be unregistered
      from position tracking. Must not be null, and the player must have been previously
      registered with the strategy.
  returns: None. The method performs an action but does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Unregister a bot from position tracking
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot pointer

      PositionStrategyBase* strategy = ...; // Assume this is a valid strategy instance

      strategy->UnregisterPosition(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player pointer was previously registered
    with the same PositionStrategyBase instance. It's important to ensure thread safety
    if multiple threads access the strategy concurrently, as unregistering may involve
    modifying internal data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer or a Player not previously registered
    may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. Always validate that the
    bot is properly registered before calling UnregisterPosition.
