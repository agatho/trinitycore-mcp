  class: Guild
  method: MassInviteToEvent
  signature: void Guild::MassInviteToEvent(WorldSession * session, uint32 minLevel,
    uint32 maxLevel, GuildRankOrder minRank)
documentation:
  brief: Invites all guild members within specified level and rank bounds to a game
    event.
  description: The MassInviteToEvent method sends invitations to all guild members
    whose character levels fall within the provided minimum and maximum bounds, and
    who hold a rank order equal to or greater than the specified minimum rank. This
    function is typically used by guild leaders or officers to quickly invite eligible
    members to events such as raids or dungeons. The method operates on the active
    session's guild context and does not return any value. It assumes that the calling
    session has appropriate permissions to perform mass invitations.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession of the player invoking the mass invitation.
      Must be valid and associated with a guild leader or officer.
  - name: minLevel
    description: Minimum character level required for a guild member to receive the
      event invitation. Must be a positive integer.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: Maximum character level allowed for a guild member to receive the
      event invitation. Must be greater than or equal to minLevel.
  - name: minRank
    description: Minimum rank order (GuildRankOrder) required for a guild member to
      receive the event invitation. Members with lower ranks will be excluded from
      the invitation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invite Guild Members Between Levels 60 and 70
    code: "Guild* guild = session->GetPlayer()->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    guild->MassInviteToEvent(session,\
      \ 60, 70, GUILD_RANK_OFFICER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally iterates through all guild members and checks their
    level and rank against the provided parameters. It is recommended to use this
    function sparingly for large guilds due to potential performance impact from iterating
    over many players.
  warnings: Ensure that the session parameter points to a valid player with sufficient
    guild permissions before calling this method, otherwise it may result in undefined
    behavior or no action being taken.
