  method: CheckHeirloomUpgrades
  signature: void CollectionMgr::CheckHeirloomUpgrades(Item * item)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given heirloom item can be upgraded and performs the upgrade
    if possible.
  description: The CheckHeirloomUpgrades method evaluates whether a specified heirloom
    item can be upgraded within the game's collection system. It typically verifies
    the item's current state, checks against game rules or conditions for upgrading,
    and applies any necessary modifications to the item's properties or status. This
    method is commonly invoked when players interact with heirloom items in their
    inventory or collections, ensuring that upgrades are properly processed according
    to World of Warcraft's mechanics. The function does not return a value but modifies
    the item directly if an upgrade is valid.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object representing the heirloom being checked
      for potential upgrades. Must be a valid pointer to an heirloom-type item; otherwise
      behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Upgrade Check for Heirloom
    code: "Item* heirloom = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (heirloom)\n{\n   \
      \ CollectionMgr::CheckHeirloomUpgrades(heirloom);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the internal collection management logic and
    may be called automatically during certain player interactions or periodic checks.
    It assumes that the item passed in has already been validated as an heirloom type.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the item is valid and represents an actual heirloom before calling
    this function.
