  method: IsQuestObjectiveProgressBarComplete
  signature: bool Player::IsQuestObjectiveProgressBarComplete(uint16 slot, const Quest
    * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest objective progress bar is complete for a given
    slot and quest.
  description: This method checks if the progress bar associated with a specific quest
    objective has reached completion for the player. It evaluates whether the player's
    progress toward completing the quest objectives has reached the required threshold,
    typically used in conjunction with quest progression mechanics to determine if
    a quest is fully completed or if specific objectives have been met. The method
    returns true when the progress bar is complete and false otherwise, allowing developers
    to accurately assess quest completion status.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The slot index of the quest objective being evaluated, typically
      ranging from 0 to 15. This represents the specific objective within a quest
      that is being checked for completion.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being evaluated, which contains the quest
      data and objectives information. This parameter is essential for determining
      the correct progress bar to check against.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective progress bar is complete,
    false otherwise. The method evaluates whether the player's progress toward completing
    the quest objectives has reached the required threshold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsQuestObjectiveProgressBarComplete(0, quest)) {\n    // Quest\
      \ objective is complete\n    // Do something here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint16 slot = 0;\nconst Quest* quest = player->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (player->IsQuestObjectiveProgressBarComplete(slot, quest)) {\n    // Process\
      \ quest completion\n    // Handle completion logic here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine overall quest completion status. It's important to note that the
    method only checks progress bar completion for a specific slot, not the entire
    quest. Performance considerations include checking only relevant slots rather
    than all slots in a quest.
  warnings: The method requires valid parameters and may return false if the quest
    is not properly initialized or if the player's progress has not yet reached the
    required threshold. Care should be taken when using this method with quest objectives
    that have multiple progress bars, as it only checks one specific slot at a time.
