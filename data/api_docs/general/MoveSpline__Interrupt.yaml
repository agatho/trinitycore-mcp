  class: MoveSpline
  method: _Interrupt
  signature: void MoveSpline::_Interrupt()
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts the current spline movement animation and resets the spline state.
  description: The _Interrupt method stops the ongoing spline-based movement animation
    for a unit, effectively halting any smooth path interpolation that is currently
    in progress. This method is typically invoked when a movement needs to be cancelled
    or overridden, such as during combat situations, spell casting, or when a new
    movement command is issued. It ensures that the unit's movement state is properly
    reset and that subsequent movement commands can be processed correctly without
    conflicts from previous spline animations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Interrupting a unit's movement
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nif (target->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == MOTION_TYPE_SPLINE_MOVE)\n{\n    target->GetMotionMaster()->Interrupt();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail of the MoveSpline class
    and should not be called directly from outside the movement system. It typically
    gets invoked automatically by the motion master when a new movement is required
    or when a movement is cancelled.
  warnings: Calling this method directly may lead to inconsistent movement states
    if not properly coordinated with the motion master's state management. Ensure
    that no other movement operations are pending before calling _Interrupt.
