  class: Ticket
  method: SetFacing
  signature: void Ticket::SetFacing(float facing)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the facing direction of the ticket object to the specified angle.
  description: The SetFacing method updates the directional orientation of a ticket
    object within the game world. This method is typically used to control how the
    ticket appears or behaves in relation to player interactions or visual presentation.
    The facing parameter represents an angle in radians, where 0.0f corresponds to
    the positive X-axis (east), and the direction rotates counter-clockwise. This
    functionality is often utilized in conjunction with other ticket-related methods
    to manage the ticket's spatial properties and ensure proper positioning within
    the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: facing
    description: "The target facing angle in radians. A value of 0.0f represents east\
      \ (positive X-axis), with counter-clockwise rotation increasing the angle. Valid\
      \ range is typically -\u03C0 to \u03C0, though exact constraints may depend\
      \ on implementation details."
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set ticket facing to north
    code: 'Ticket* ticket = ...;

      ticket->SetFacing(M_PI / 2.0f); // 90 degrees counter-clockwise from east'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set ticket facing based on player direction
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      float playerFacing = player->GetOrientation();

      ticket->SetFacing(playerFacing); // Match the ticket''s facing to the player''s
      orientation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal state variables related to the ticket's
    orientation. It may trigger visual updates or affect how the ticket interacts
    with other game entities. The facing angle is usually stored in radians and converted
    internally for display purposes.
  warnings: "Ensure that the facing value passed is within expected bounds (-\u03C0\
    \ to \u03C0) to avoid unexpected behavior. Incorrectly setting the facing direction\
    \ might cause visual glitches or misalignment in the ticket's presentation."
