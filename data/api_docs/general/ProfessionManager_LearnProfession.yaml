  signature: bool ProfessionManager::LearnProfession(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach a player a specific profession, returning true on success
    or false if the operation fails.
  description: The LearnProfession method is used within the TrinityCore framework
    to assign a specified profession to a player character. This function typically
    checks for prerequisites such as minimum skill levels, required items, or previous
    profession knowledge before allowing the player to learn a new profession. It
    interacts with the player's in-game profession data and updates their character
    sheet accordingly. The method may also trigger related game events or achievements
    associated with learning a new skill. It is commonly used in quest systems, trainer
    NPCs, or administrative commands where a player needs to gain access to new crafting
    abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which character will learn the profession.
  - name: profession
    description: An enum value of type ProfessionType that identifies the specific
      profession to be learned. Valid values include all recognized crafting and gathering
      professions in World of Warcraft such as Mining, Herbalism, Blacksmithing, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the player successfully learns the specified profession;
    otherwise returns false. Failure can occur due to invalid player GUID, unsupported
    profession type, or unmet prerequisites.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType mining = PROFESSION_MINING;\nbool\
      \ success = sProfessionManager->LearnProfession(&playerId, mining);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Player has learned Mining\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType herbalism = PROFESSION_HERBALISM;\n\
      if (sProfessionManager->LearnProfession(&playerId, herbalism)) {\n    // Notify\
      \ player that they've learned Herbalism\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(\"You have\
      \ learned Herbalism!\");\n} else {\n    // Log error or notify player of failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Failed to teach player %d Herbalism\"\
      , playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object is valid and exists in the database.
    The profession type must be a supported value within the TrinityCore codebase.
    This function does not perform any checks for player level or skill requirements
    beyond what is defined by the core system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    character, otherwise behavior is undefined. Passing invalid profession types may
    lead to crashes or silent failures depending on implementation details.
