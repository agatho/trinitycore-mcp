  method: GetBotCountInGroup
  signature: uint32 PlayerBotHooks::GetBotCountInGroup(const Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bot players in the specified group.
  description: The GetBotCountInGroup method calculates and returns the total count
    of player bots currently present in a given group. This method is typically used
    within the PlayerBot system to monitor or manage bot populations within player
    groups. It iterates through all members of the provided group and identifies which
    ones are controlled by bots rather than real players. The method assumes that
    the group pointer is valid and properly initialized, as it directly accesses group
    member data without additional validation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to the Group object for which to count bot members. Must
      be a valid group instance; passing nullptr may result in undefined behavior
      or crashes.
  returns: The number of player bots currently in the specified group. Returns zero
    if the group is empty or contains no bot players.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Count Bots in a Group
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 botCount = PlayerBotHooks::GetBotCountInGroup(myGroup);

      TC_LOG_INFO("playerbots", "Bot count in group: %u", botCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Bot Count for Group Management Logic
    code: "if (PlayerBotHooks::GetBotCountInGroup(player->GetGroup()) > 3)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle case where too many bots are in the group\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      playerbots\", \"Too many bots detected in group\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore's
    PlayerBot system. It may not account for bots that are temporarily disconnected
    or in an invalid state. The performance impact is minimal as it only iterates
    through group members once, but frequent calls should be avoided in performance-critical
    sections.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the group parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always verify that the group exists and is valid before
    calling this method. Additionally, if the group structure changes during execution
    (e.g., members are added/removed), the returned count may become stale.
