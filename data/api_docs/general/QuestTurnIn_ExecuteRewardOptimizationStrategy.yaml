  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ExecuteRewardOptimizationStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteRewardOptimizationStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the reward optimization strategy for a player completing a quest.
  description: The ExecuteRewardOptimizationStrategy method determines and applies
    the most efficient reward distribution mechanism for a player who has completed
    a quest. This includes evaluating available rewards, considering player inventory
    capacity, and selecting optimal reward types such as experience, gold, items,
    or reputation. The method ensures that the reward delivery process maximizes player
    benefit while adhering to game balance and resource constraints. It is typically
    invoked during quest completion processing within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player who has
      completed the quest and will receive the optimized rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Reward Optimization
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.ExecuteRewardOptimizationStrategy(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal reward queues and inventory management
    systems. It may perform checks for item stacking limits, quest-specific reward
    exclusions, and player class or faction restrictions. The optimization logic might
    prioritize experience over gold if the player is near a level-up threshold.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid undefined behavior. This method modifies player state directly, so it should
    only be called during appropriate quest completion contexts.
