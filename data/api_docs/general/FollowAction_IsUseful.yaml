documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the follow action is useful for the bot AI.
  description: The IsUseful method evaluates if the current follow action should be
    considered active or beneficial within the context of the bot's AI behavior. This
    method typically checks conditions such as whether a valid target exists, if the
    bot is already following the target, or if the follow action aligns with the bot's
    current state and objectives. It plays a crucial role in decision-making for the
    AI to determine when to initiate or continue following another unit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the follow action is deemed useful or applicable under
    current conditions; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "if (followAction.IsUseful(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with executing the follow\
      \ action\n    ai->GetBot()->SetFollowTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other AI decision-making
    methods to ensure that actions are only taken when beneficial. It may involve
    checking for target validity, distance thresholds, or state consistency.
