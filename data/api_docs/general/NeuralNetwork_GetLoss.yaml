  brief: Calculates and returns the current loss value of the neural network for training
    evaluation
  description: The GetLoss method computes and returns the current loss value of the
    neural network, which represents the difference between predicted and actual values
    during training. This value is typically used to monitor training progress and
    determine when the model has converged. The method performs no modifications to
    the network state and is generally called during training iterations or validation
    phases. In the context of TrinityCore's AI systems, this method would be used
    to evaluate how well a neural network-based decision-making system is performing
    against expected outcomes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current loss of the neural network. Lower
    values indicate better performance with less difference between predicted and
    actual outputs. The exact mathematical formula for loss calculation depends on
    the specific implementation and training methodology used by the neural network.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Training Loop
    code: 'NeuralNetwork* network = new NeuralNetwork();

      // ... training code ...

      float currentLoss = network->GetLoss();

      printf("Current loss: %f\n", currentLoss);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Training Progress
    code: "for (int epoch = 0; epoch < 1000; ++epoch) {\n    // ... perform training\
      \ step ...\n    float loss = network->GetLoss();\n    if (loss < 0.01f) {\n\
      \        printf(\"Training converged at epoch %d with loss %f\\n\", epoch, loss);\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically computationally expensive as it requires forward
    propagation through the entire network to calculate the loss. It should be called
    sparingly during intensive training operations. The returned value may vary based
    on normalization factors and the specific loss function implemented in the neural
    network class.
  warnings: Calling this method during high-frequency training loops may impact performance
    significantly. Ensure that the neural network has been properly initialized and
    trained before calling GetLoss, as uninitialized networks may return undefined
    values.
