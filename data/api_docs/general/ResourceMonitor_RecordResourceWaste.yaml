  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: RecordResourceWaste
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceWaste(uint32 botGuid, ResourceType
    type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Records the amount of resources wasted by a bot for a specific resource type.
  description: The RecordResourceWaste method logs the quantity of a specified resource
    that was wasted by a bot identified by its GUID. This function is typically used
    in automated bot systems or AI-driven gameplay mechanics to track inefficiencies
    or resource mismanagement. The method does not return any value but updates internal
    tracking structures within the ResourceMonitor class. It assumes that the bot
    GUID and resource type are valid, and the amount is a non-negative integer representing
    the quantity of resources wasted.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that caused the resource
      waste. This value must correspond to an existing bot within the system.
  - name: type
    description: The type of resource that was wasted, represented as a ResourceType
      enum or similar identifier. Valid values depend on the defined resource types
      in the system.
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of the specified resource that was wasted. Must be a
      non-negative integer representing the amount of resources lost.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ResourceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.RecordResourceWaste(12345, ResourceType::GOLD, 100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Resource Types
    code: 'ResourceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.RecordResourceWaste(67890, ResourceType::IRON, 250);

      monitor.RecordResourceWaste(67890, ResourceType::WOOD, 150);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other resource tracking methods
    to provide a complete picture of bot behavior. The implementation may involve
    thread-safe operations if multiple bots are tracked concurrently. It's important
    that the bot GUID exists in the system to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid corresponds to an active and valid bot; otherwise,
    the tracking may fail or cause inconsistencies. Also, be cautious with large amounts
    of data being recorded, as this could impact performance if not properly buffered
    or batched.
