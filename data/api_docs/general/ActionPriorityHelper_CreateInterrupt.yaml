  class: ActionPriorityHelper
  method: CreateInterrupt
  signature: PrioritizedAction ActionPriorityHelper::CreateInterrupt(uint32 spellId,
    int * target, uint32 enemySpellId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a prioritized interrupt action for a specified spell and target.
  description: The CreateInterrupt method generates a PrioritizedAction object that
    represents an interrupt ability to be used against an enemy. This action is typically
    used in AI decision-making systems to determine when and how to interrupt enemy
    spellcasting. The method takes a spell ID, optional target reference, and an optional
    enemy spell ID to configure the interrupt behavior. The returned PrioritizedAction
    can then be evaluated by the AI system based on priority rules and conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the interrupt spell to be created. This
      must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target of the interrupt. Can
      be NULL if no specific target is required or if target selection is handled
      separately.
  - name: enemySpellId
    description: Optional identifier of the enemy spell being interrupted. Used to
      determine appropriate interrupt timing and conditions based on the enemy's current
      casting spell.
  returns: A PrioritizedAction object that encapsulates the interrupt ability with
    its associated priority, spell ID, and target information. This action can be
    queued or executed by the AI system based on priority evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interrupt Creation
    code: PrioritizedAction interrupt = helper.CreateInterrupt(2139, nullptr, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Interrupt with Specific Target and Enemy Spell
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      PrioritizedAction interrupt = helper.CreateInterrupt(1766, &targetId, 34098);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI logic for determining when to interrupt
    enemy casters. The target parameter allows for flexible targeting strategies,
    while the enemySpellId enables context-aware interrupt decisions. The method does
    not perform validation on spell IDs or targets - it assumes valid inputs are provided
    by the calling code.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid interrupt spell
    in the game database. Using invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior
    or failed actions during AI execution. The target pointer should be managed carefully
    to avoid dangling references.
