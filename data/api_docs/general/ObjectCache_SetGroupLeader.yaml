  signature: void ObjectCache::SetGroupLeader(Player * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the group leader for the current object cache instance
  description: The SetGroupLeader method assigns a new group leader to the ObjectCache
    instance. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to manage group leadership within player groups. The method updates internal tracking
    of the group leader and may trigger related events or updates in the game state.
    It is commonly called when a new leader is designated for a group, such as when
    a player takes control of a group or when group membership changes occur.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will become the new group leader.
      Must be a valid Player instance that is currently in a group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a new group leader
    code: 'Player* newLeader = ...; // Get reference to player

      ObjectCache* cache = ...; // Get reference to object cache

      (cache)->SetGroupLeader(newLeader);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal group leadership tracking and may trigger
    notifications to other players in the group. The implementation should ensure
    thread safety when modifying shared group state.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents a player
    who is actually part of a group, otherwise behavior may be undefined or cause
    crashes.
