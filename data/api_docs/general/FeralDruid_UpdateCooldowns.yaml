  method: UpdateCooldowns
  signature: void FeralDruid::UpdateCooldowns(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for all abilities used by the feral druid.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking of a FeralDruid character. This method is typically
    called during each update cycle to decrement active cooldowns and handle the activation
    of abilities once their cooldowns expire. It ensures that abilities such as Shred,
    Rake, and other feral-specific spells are properly managed according to game mechanics.
    The function processes all currently active cooldowns within the druid's ability
    set, reducing their remaining time by the specified delta time (diff) and triggering
    any necessary actions when a cooldown reaches zero.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value determines how much time has passed and is used to decrement active cooldown
      timers accordingly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Cooldowns Call
    code: "void Update(uint32 diff) {\n    // Called every game tick\n    m_feralDruid->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "class FeralDruidAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (m_feralDruid)\n            m_feralDruid->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly, typically within the creature or
    player update loop. It is crucial for maintaining accurate cooldown states and
    ensuring proper ability usage timing in combat scenarios.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter may result in incorrect cooldown
    behavior. Always pass the actual elapsed time since last call to maintain synchronization
    with game time.
