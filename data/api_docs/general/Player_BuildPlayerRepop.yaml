  brief: Generates and sends the player's resurrection visual effects and related
    data to the client.
  description: The BuildPlayerRepop method is responsible for constructing and sending
    the player's resurrection visual effects to the client. This method handles the
    creation of the resurrection packet that includes the player's visual appearance,
    animation, and related data. It typically occurs when a player is resurrected
    from death, either through natural resurrection or by a priest's ressurection
    spell. The method ensures that the player's visual state is properly updated and
    that the client receives the appropriate visual feedback for the resurrection
    event.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->BuildPlayerRepop();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the resurrection process and may involve
    multiple internal steps including updating the player's health, mana, and visual
    state. The method should be called after the player has been resurrected but before
    they are fully returned to the game world.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by other methods without proper
    context. It is typically invoked during the resurrection process and requires
    the player to be in a valid state for resurrection to occur.
