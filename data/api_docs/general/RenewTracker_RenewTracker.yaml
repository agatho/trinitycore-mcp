  brief: Initializes or resets the RenewTracker instance for managing spell renewal
    tracking.
  description: The RenewTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the RenewTracker
    class, setting up internal state for tracking spell renewals. This method is typically
    called when creating a new tracker object to ensure proper initialization of all
    member variables and data structures used for monitoring and managing spell renewals
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method prepares the tracker to handle subsequent
    operations such as adding tracked spells, checking renewal status, or updating
    spell timers.

  - title: Creating a new RenewTracker instance
    code: 'RenewTracker* tracker = new RenewTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track spell renewals'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during object construction. It's recommended
    to use smart pointers or proper memory management when creating RenewTracker instances
    to avoid memory leaks.
