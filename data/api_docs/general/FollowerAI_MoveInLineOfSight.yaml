documentation:
  brief: Handles AI behavior when a follower unit detects an entity in its line of
    sight.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core part of the FollowerAI class
    that manages how a follower unit responds when it detects another unit within
    its visual range. This method typically triggers the AI to initiate combat, follow,
    or engage with the detected target based on the follower's current state and assigned
    behavior. It is automatically invoked by the game engine when a unit enters the
    follower's line of sight, making it essential for proper AI functionality in quest-related
    NPCs or companion units. The method does not take any parameters and operates
    purely on internal AI state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Follower AI Line of Sight Detection
    code: "class MyFollowerAI : public FollowerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(Unit*\
      \ who) override\n    {\n        if (!who || who->GetTypeId() != TYPEID_PLAYER)\n\
      \            return;\n\n        // Custom logic when player enters line of sight\n\
      \        if (GetFollowState() == FOLLOW_FOLLOW)\n        {\n            // Initiate\
      \ combat or conversation\n            AttackStart(who);\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically overridden by derived AI classes to customize follower
    behavior. It's important to note that the base implementation may perform basic
    state updates, so any override should consider calling the parent implementation
    if needed.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you're implementing a custom AI
    behavior. The method is designed to be triggered automatically by the game engine
    when units enter line of sight.
