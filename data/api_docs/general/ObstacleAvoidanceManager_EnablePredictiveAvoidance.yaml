  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::EnablePredictiveAvoidance(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables predictive avoidance behavior for obstacle avoidance
    in the AI system.
  description: The EnablePredictiveAvoidance method controls whether the ObstacleAvoidanceManager
    uses predictive algorithms to anticipate and avoid obstacles in the game world.
    When enabled, the system will attempt to predict future positions of moving obstacles
    and adjust movement paths accordingly. This feature enhances NPC navigation by
    reducing collisions with dynamic environment elements such as moving vehicles,
    other creatures, or interactive objects. The method takes a boolean parameter
    that determines the state of this predictive behavior, allowing developers to
    toggle it on or off based on performance requirements or specific gameplay needs.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      predictive avoidance functionality. When true, the system will use predictive
      algorithms; when false, it will rely on basic obstacle detection only.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Predictive Avoidance
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = player->GetMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();

      manager->EnablePredictiveAvoidance(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Predictive Avoidance for Performance
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetObstacleAvoidanceManager();

      manager->EnablePredictiveAvoidance(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the AI movement behavior of units controlled by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager.
    The predictive avoidance algorithm may introduce additional CPU overhead during
    pathfinding calculations. It is recommended to enable this feature selectively
    for important NPCs or in performance-optimized environments.
  warnings: Disabling predictive avoidance may result in less natural-looking movement
    patterns for NPCs, particularly when navigating around moving obstacles. Ensure
    that any toggling of this setting occurs at appropriate times to avoid abrupt
    changes in AI behavior during gameplay.
