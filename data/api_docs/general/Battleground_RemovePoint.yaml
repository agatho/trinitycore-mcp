  class: Battleground
  method: RemovePoint
  signature: void Battleground::RemovePoint(int team, int points)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified points from a team's score in the battleground.
  description: The RemovePoint method decreases the point count of a specified team
    within a battleground instance. This method is typically used during gameplay
    to deduct points from teams based on various game events such as capturing objectives,
    defeating players, or other battleground-specific actions. The method operates
    on the internal scoring system of the battleground and updates the team's score
    accordingly. It accepts a team identifier and the number of points to remove,
    ensuring that point deductions are properly applied to maintain accurate gameplay
    statistics.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier from which points will be removed. Valid values
      are typically 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde in standard battlegrounds.
  - name: points
    description: The number of points to remove from the specified team's score. Must
      be a non-negative integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove 5 points from the Horde team
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->RemovePoint(1, 5); // Remove 5 points from Horde (team 1)\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Deduct points based on player death
    code: "void OnPlayerDeath(Player* player)\n{\n    Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground();\n\
      \    if (bg && player->GetBattlegroundTypeId() == BATTLEGROUND_AV)\n    {\n\
      \        // Remove 1 point from the player's team when they die\n        bg->RemovePoint(player->GetTeamId(),\
      \ 1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal score tracking of the battleground.
    It should only be called during active battleground sessions where scoring is
    valid. The method does not perform any validation on the point values, so calling
    with negative point values may result in unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid team identifiers or extremely large point
    values can cause undefined behavior. Ensure that the team parameter corresponds
    to valid team IDs (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) and that points are non-negative
    integers. Avoid calling this method outside of active battleground contexts.
