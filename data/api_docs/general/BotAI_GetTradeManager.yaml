  class: BotAI
  method: GetTradeManager
  signature: const TradeManager * BotAI::GetTradeManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the trade manager instance used by the bot AI.
  description: The GetTradeManager method retrieves a constant pointer to the TradeManager
    object associated with this BotAI instance. This manager handles all trading-related
    logic and state for the bot, including item evaluation, trade negotiations, and
    transaction processing. The returned pointer is guaranteed to be valid during
    the lifetime of the BotAI object and should not be modified or deleted by callers.
    This method allows other components to access the bot's trading capabilities without
    direct dependency on internal AI implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the TradeManager instance used by this BotAI. Returns
    nullptr if no trade manager has been initialized or if the bot AI is in an invalid
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Trade Manager for Trading Logic
    code: "const TradeManager* tradeMgr = botAI->GetTradeManager();\nif (tradeMgr\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use trade manager to evaluate trades\n    bool canTrade\
      \ = tradeMgr->CanTradeWith(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TradeManager pointer is managed internally by the BotAI class
    and should not be deleted or modified. The method is thread-safe as long as the
    BotAI instance itself is accessed in a thread-safe manner. This method may return
    nullptr if called before the bot AI has been fully initialized with trading capabilities.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value indicates a fully functional
    trade manager; verify the manager's state before using its methods. Accessing
    the returned pointer after the BotAI instance has been destroyed leads to undefined
    behavior.
