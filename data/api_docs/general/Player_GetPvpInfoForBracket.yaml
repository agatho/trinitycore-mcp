  class: Player
  method: GetPvpInfoForBracket
  signature: const int * Player::GetPvpInfoForBracket(int8 bracket) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns PvP information for a specific bracket.
  description: This method retrieves the PvP statistics for a given bracket, including
    wins and losses. It provides data about player's competitive arena or battleground
    performance in that specific bracket. The returned data is used for displaying
    PvP information in the UI and tracking player's competitive progress across different
    bracket types.
  parameters:
  - name: bracket
    description: The bracket identifier (0-6) representing different PvP modes such
      as 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, etc. The bracket index corresponds to specific PvP modes in
      the game.
  returns: Returns a pointer to an array containing the PvP statistics for the specified
    bracket. The array contains two integers representing wins and losses respectively.
    Returns nullptr if the bracket is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Get PvP info for 5v5 bracket
    code: "const int* pvpInfo = player->GetPvpInfoForBracket(5);\nif (pvpInfo) {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Wins: \" << pvpInfo[0] << \" Losses: \" << pvpInfo[1] <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other PvP-related methods
    to provide comprehensive player statistics. Performance considerations are minimal
    as this method simply retrieves stored data without complex computations.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if the bracket is invalid or not found,
    so proper validation should be performed before dereferencing the pointer.
