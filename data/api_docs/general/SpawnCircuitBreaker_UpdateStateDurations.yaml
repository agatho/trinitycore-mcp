documentation:
  brief: Updates the duration timers for all active states within the spawn circuit
    breaker.
  description: The UpdateStateDurations method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal timers associated with each state of the SpawnCircuitBreaker. This
    method ensures that states transition correctly based on their configured time
    limits, preventing excessive or prolonged activation of specific spawn behaviors.
    It typically runs during each game tick or update cycle to maintain accurate timing
    for state transitions. The method does not directly modify external data but rather
    updates internal state duration tracking variables.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all circuit breakers\n    for\
      \ (auto& breaker : m_spawnCircuitBreakers)\n    {\n        breaker->UpdateStateDurations();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the game loop or update system.
    It's important to ensure that this method is invoked regularly enough to maintain
    accurate timing for state transitions, especially in high-frequency systems.
