    & pvpLogData) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates a PvP log data packet with statistics for an arena match.
  description: The BuildPvPLogDataPacket method constructs and fills a WorldPackets::Battleground::PVPMatchStatistics
    packet with detailed performance metrics and match data for an arena battleground.
    This method is typically invoked when reporting the results of an arena match
    to players, including player kills, deaths, honor gained, and other relevant statistics.
    The constructed packet can then be sent to clients to display match outcomes and
    update player records accordingly. The method operates on the arena's internal
    match data and does not modify any external state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Match End
    code: 'Arena* arena = ...; // Assume arena instance exists

      WorldPackets::Battleground::PVPMatchStatistics pvpLogData;

      arena->BuildPvPLogDataPacket(pvpLogData);

      // Send pvpLogData to players via WorldSession::SendPacket()

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the arena has completed its match and all relevant
    statistics are available. It is designed to be called during the match cleanup
    phase, typically after the battleground has been marked as finished but before
    it is fully reset.
