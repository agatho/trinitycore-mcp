documentation:
  brief: Summons a temporary creature onto the map at the specified position with
    given properties and duration.
  description: The SummonCreature method creates and spawns a temporary creature on
    the map at the specified location. It supports various summoning properties including
    duration, summoner reference, spell ID, vehicle ID, and private object owner.
    The summoned creature will be of type TempSummon, which is a specialized subclass
    of WorldObject designed for temporary creatures that are automatically removed
    after their duration expires or under certain conditions. This method is commonly
    used in AI scripts, spells, and game mechanics where temporary creatures need
    to be created dynamically.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID (creature_template.entry) that defines the
      type of creature to summon
  - name: pos
    description: The Position structure specifying the x, y, z coordinates and orientation
      where the creature will be summoned
  - name: properties
    description: Pointer to SummonPropertiesEntry that defines summoning behavior,
      such as faction, flags, and summon type
  - name: duration
    description: Duration in milliseconds for how long the summoned creature will
      exist (negative value means infinite duration)
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to WorldObject that is the source of this summoning, typically
      a player or creature
  - name: spellId
    description: The spell ID associated with this summoning, used for tracking and
      effects
  - name: vehId
    description: Vehicle ID if the summoned creature should be mounted on a vehicle
      (0 means no vehicle)
  - name: privateObjectOwner
    description: Private object owner identifier, used for ownership tracking and
      cleanup purposes
  - name: smoothPhasingInfo
    description: Pointer to SmoothPhasingInfo for handling phasing transitions during
      summoning (can be NULL)
  returns: Returns a pointer to the created TempSummon object representing the summoned
    creature. Returns NULL if the summoning fails due to invalid parameters or resource
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic creature summon
    code: "Position pos = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f};\nTempSummon* summoned =\
      \ map->SummonCreature(12345, pos, nullptr, 5000, player, 0, 0, 0);\nif (summoned)\n\
      {\n    // Creature successfully summoned\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Summon with specific properties and duration
    code: "Position pos = {50.0f, 60.0f, 70.0f, M_PI / 2};\nSummonPropertiesEntry*\
      \ props = sSummonPropertiesStore.LookupEntry(1);\nTempSummon* summoned = map->SummonCreature(98765,\
      \ pos, props, 10000, npc, 12345, 0, 0);\nif (summoned)\n{\n    // Creature summoned\
      \ with specific properties for 10 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TempSummon object is automatically managed by the map and will
    be destroyed when its duration expires or when explicitly removed. The method
    performs internal validation of parameters, but invalid entries or positions may
    cause silent failures or undefined behavior. This method should only be called
    from a valid Map context.
  warnings: Do not call this method with NULL summoner parameter unless absolutely
    necessary, as it can lead to broken references. Be careful with negative duration
    values as they create permanent summons that must be manually cleaned up. The
    position coordinates should be within valid map boundaries to avoid spawning issues.
