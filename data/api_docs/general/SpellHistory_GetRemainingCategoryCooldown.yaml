    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds for a spell's category
    cooldown.
  description: This method retrieves the time remaining on a spell's category-based
    cooldown. In World of Warcraft, certain spells belong to the same category and
    cannot be cast again until their cooldown expires. This function checks if a spell
    has an active category cooldown and returns the number of milliseconds left before
    it can be used again. If no category cooldown is active, it returns 0. The method
    operates on the SpellInfo structure which contains information about a specific
    spell, including its cooldown properties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the remaining cooldown time in milliseconds
    for the spell's category. A return value of 0 indicates that no category cooldown
    is currently active or has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spell can be cast based on category cooldown
    code: "const SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nint remainingCooldown\
      \ = spellHistory->GetRemainingCategoryCooldown(spellInfo);\nif (remainingCooldown\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // Spell is ready to be cast\n    // Proceed with casting logic\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Spell is on cooldown, display remaining time\n    // Handle\
      \ cooldown logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in spell casting validation logic. The category
    cooldown system helps enforce game balance by preventing excessive use of spells
    that belong to the same category. This function does not modify any internal state
    and is read-only.
