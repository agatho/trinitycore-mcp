documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the configuration settings for the Auction Bot Buyer
    module.
  description: The LoadConfig method is responsible for reading and applying the configuration
    parameters specific to the AuctionBotBuyer class. This method typically reads
    from a configuration file or database to set up internal state variables such
    as bid thresholds, item categories, price multipliers, and other buyer-specific
    behaviors. It ensures that the auction bot operates according to predefined rules
    and settings without requiring manual intervention. The method should be called
    during system initialization or when configuration changes are detected.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Load
    code: 'AuctionBotBuyer buyer;

      buyer.LoadConfig();

      // Configuration is now loaded and buyer is ready to operate'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called multiple times during runtime if configuration
    updates are applied dynamically. Ensure that any existing auction operations are
    paused or interrupted before calling LoadConfig to avoid inconsistent behavior.
  warnings: Calling LoadConfig while active auctions are in progress might lead to
    unexpected behavior or data inconsistency. It's recommended to stop all buyer
    activities before reloading the configuration.
