  signature: void InterruptDatabase::LoadGeneralSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Loads general interrupt spells from the database into memory for use during
    gameplay.
  description: The LoadGeneralSpells method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the InterruptDatabase class with spell information related
    to spell interruption mechanics. This method is typically called during server
    startup or database reload operations to ensure that all relevant interrupt spell
    data is available for processing when players cast spells or are interrupted by
    other actions. The method retrieves data from the game's database tables containing
    spell interrupt definitions and caches them in memory for fast lookup during combat
    and spell casting events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'InterruptDatabase interruptDb;

      interruptDb.LoadGeneralSpells(); // Called once during server startup'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. It's typically invoked as part of the TrinityCore server initialization
    sequence to ensure spell interruption data is available before gameplay begins.
