  method: RemoveOverrideSpell
  signature: void Player::RemoveOverrideSpell(uint32 overridenSpellId, uint32 newSpellId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a spell override from the player's spell list.
  description: This method removes a specific spell override from the player's spell
    list, effectively reverting the player back to using their original spell instead
    of the overridden version. The method is typically used in conjunction with AddOverrideSpell
    to manage spell overrides during gameplay. It ensures that the specified override
    is removed from the player's current spell set, allowing normal spell usage to
    resume.
  parameters:
  - name: overridenSpellId
    description: The ID of the spell that was previously overridden. This represents
      the spell being removed from the override list.
  - name: newSpellId
    description: The ID of the new spell that replaces the overridden spell. This
      is the spell that will be used instead of the original override.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveOverrideSpell(12345, 67890);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the player's spell list
    and may impact gameplay mechanics such as spell cooldowns or effects. The implementation
    relies on internal spell override tracking mechanisms.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell behavior or loss
    of spell effects if not properly managed with AddOverrideSpell. It should be used
    in conjunction with the corresponding AddOverrideSpell method for complete spell
    override management.
