    & eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Manages attendance for a guild event by updating player participation status.
  description: The ManageEventAttendance method handles the tracking and updating
    of player attendance for a specific guild event identified by its event ID. This
    method is typically invoked when a player joins or leaves a guild event, or when
    event attendance needs to be synchronized with the guild's event management system.
    The function takes a pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier
    and the unique event ID string to update the attendance records accordingly. It
    ensures that player participation data is correctly maintained within the guild's
    event framework.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer value representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) for attendance tracking.
  - name: eventId
    description: String identifier uniquely identifying the guild event for which
      attendance is being managed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Attendance Management
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ManageEventAttendance(&playerId, "event_001");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event databases and may
    trigger notifications or updates to other systems when attendance changes. It
    assumes the player ID and event ID are valid and exist within the game's data
    structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, verify
    that the eventId corresponds to an actual existing guild event to avoid invalid
    data operations.
