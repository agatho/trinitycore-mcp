documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is currently in a raid group
  description: The IsInRaid method checks if the player associated with the GroupCoordinator
    instance is currently part of a raid group. This method returns true if the player
    is in a raid (i.e., the group has 5 or more members), and false otherwise. In
    World of Warcraft's context, this is commonly used to determine appropriate gameplay
    behavior, such as whether to display raid-specific UI elements, enable raid-based
    achievements, or restrict certain actions that are only available in raid environments.
    The method relies on the internal group size tracking mechanism within TrinityCore's
    group management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in a raid group (group size >= 5), false
    if the player is in a normal party (group size < 5) or not in any group at all.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check raid status
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->IsInRaid()) {\n    // Player is in a raid, enable\
      \ raid-specific features\n    SendRaidUIUpdate();\n} else {\n    // Player is\
      \ not in a raid, show party UI\n    SendPartyUIUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsInRaid for conditional quest logic
    code: "if (player->GetGroupCoordinator()->IsInRaid()) {\n    // Grant raid-specific\
      \ quest rewards or access\n    player->AddQuestReward(RAID_QUEST_REWARD);\n\
      } else {\n    // Provide normal quest rewards\n    player->AddQuestReward(NORMAL_QUEST_REWARD);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally checks the group's member count and determines if
    it qualifies as a raid. It does not validate whether the group is actually in
    a raid instance or dungeon, only that it meets the size requirement for being
    classified as a raid. The method is thread-safe as it operates on local group
    state information.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a player is inside a specific
    raid instance or zone. It only indicates group composition size and does not account
    for dungeon or instance validity. Using this method in performance-critical code
    paths may have minimal overhead but should still be considered in high-frequency
    scenarios.
