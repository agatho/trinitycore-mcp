  brief: Initializes the Eye of the Storm strategy for the battleground AI.
  description: The InitializeEOTSStrategy method sets up the strategic behavior and
    objectives for the Eye of the Storm battleground mode within the BattlegroundAI
    system. This method configures the AI's approach to capturing and defending objectives,
    managing resource allocation, and coordinating player actions specific to the
    Eye of the Storm game mechanics. It is typically called during battleground initialization
    to establish the proper tactical framework for the AI-controlled players. The
    method prepares internal data structures and state variables necessary for the
    Eye of the Storm gameplay loop.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = new BattlegroundAI();

      bgAI->InitializeEOTSStrategy();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the battleground has been properly
    initialized and the Eye of the Storm specific objectives have been set up. The
    method does not return any value but modifies internal AI state variables that
    affect gameplay behavior.
