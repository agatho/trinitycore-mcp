  class: GuildEventCoordinator

  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ConfigureEventNotifications(uint32 playerGuid,
    bool enableReminders)
documentation:
  brief: Configures whether a player receives guild event reminder notifications
  description: The ConfigureEventNotifications method enables or disables guild event
    reminder notifications for a specific player identified by their GUID. This functionality
    allows players to control whether they receive in-game alerts about upcoming guild
    events such as raids, guild meetings, or other scheduled activities. The method
    updates the player's notification preferences within the guild event coordinator
    system, which may affect how often and when reminders are sent. This configuration
    is typically managed through the game's user interface or command system and persists
    across server sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose notification preferences
      are being configured. This value must correspond to a valid player in the database.
  - name: enableReminders
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      guild event reminders for the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable guild event reminders for a player
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::ConfigureEventNotifications(12345, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable guild event reminders for a player
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::ConfigureEventNotifications(67890, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to persist player notification
    preferences. The implementation may involve caching mechanisms to reduce database
    load when multiple configuration changes occur in quick succession. Notification
    delivery is typically handled by a separate system that periodically checks for
    upcoming events and sends alerts based on configured preferences.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or database errors. Ensure that the player GUID corresponds to an existing
    character before invoking this method. Changes made through this function are
    not immediately reflected in the UI without a corresponding refresh of the guild
    event calendar or notification settings panel.
