  method: InRangeYZX
  signature: bool PathGenerator::InRangeYZX(const float * v1, const float * v2, float
    r, float h) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if two 3D points are within specified YZ and X distance thresholds.
  description: The InRangeYZX method determines whether two 3D points (represented
    as float arrays) are within given radial and height thresholds. It compares the
    YZ distance (in the vertical plane) and X distance (horizontal) between the two
    points to see if they fall within the specified bounds. This is commonly used
    in pathfinding and AI logic to determine proximity of entities or waypoints in
    a 3D space, particularly for determining if an NPC can reach a target position
    based on movement constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: v1
    description: Pointer to the first 3D point represented as a float array with [x,
      y, z] coordinates.
  - name: v2
    description: Pointer to the second 3D point represented as a float array with
      [x, y, z] coordinates.
  - name: r
    description: Radial threshold for YZ distance comparison (maximum allowed distance
      in the YZ plane).
  - name: h
    description: Height threshold for vertical distance comparison (maximum allowed
      difference in Z coordinate).
  returns: Returns true if both the YZ distance and X distance between the two points
    are within the specified thresholds, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check proximity of two positions
    code: 'float pos1[3] = {10.0f, 20.0f, 5.0f};

      float pos2[3] = {12.0f, 22.0f, 6.0f};

      bool isInRange = pathGenerator.InRangeYZX(pos1, pos2, 3.0f, 2.0f); // Checks
      if positions are within 3 YZ units and 2 Z units'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in pathfinding algorithms where movement constraints
    are important. The YZ distance is calculated using Euclidean distance in the YZ
    plane, while X distance is simply the absolute difference between X coordinates.
