  class: NotNormalLootItem
  method: NotNormalLootItem
  signature: void NotNormalLootItem::NotNormalLootItem(uint8 _index, bool _islooted)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a non-normal loot item with specified index and looted status.
  description: The NotNormalLootItem constructor initializes a loot item that is not
    part of the standard loot system. This method sets up internal tracking for a
    specific item index and its looted state, which is crucial for managing special
    or quest-related loot items in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The
    initialization ensures proper handling of item distribution and prevents duplicate
    looting of unique items. This constructor is typically used internally by the
    loot system when creating temporary or special loot entries that don't follow
    the standard loot table mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: _index
    description: The index position of the loot item within the loot container. Must
      be a valid uint8 value representing the item's position in the loot list.
  - name: _islooted
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the item has already been looted.
      True if the item is marked as looted, false otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'NotNormalLootItem lootItem(5, false);

      // Creates a new non-normal loot item at index 5, not yet looted'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Already Looted Item
    code: 'NotNormalLootItem lootItem(12, true);

      // Creates a non-normal loot item at index 12 that is already marked as looted'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal loot management system and should
    not be called directly by external modules. The class likely inherits from or
    works alongside other loot-related classes in TrinityCore's loot system. The index
    parameter corresponds to the item's position within a specific loot container,
    such as a mob's loot list.
  warnings: Do not use this constructor for regular loot items; it is specifically
    designed for special or non-standard loot cases. Incorrect usage of the index
    value may lead to undefined behavior in loot distribution. The looted status flag
    must be accurately set to prevent duplicate item distribution.
