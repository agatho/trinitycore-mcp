documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the active state type of the unit action bar entry
  description: The GetType method returns the ActiveStates enumeration value that
    represents the current activation state of the unit's action bar entry. This is
    used to determine whether the action bar entry is currently active, passive, or
    in another defined state within the game's action management system. The returned
    value helps control how the action bar entry behaves in different gameplay scenarios
    such as combat states, spell casting, or item usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActiveStates enumeration value indicating the current activation state
    of the unit action bar entry. Possible values include but are not limited to ACTIVE_STATE_ACTIVE,
    ACTIVE_STATE_PASSIVE, and other defined states within the TrinityCore action bar
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Check Action Bar Entry State
    code: "UnitActionBarEntry* entry = player->GetActionBarEntry(1);\nActiveStates\
      \ state = entry->GetType();\nif (state == ACTIVE_STATE_ACTIVE)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ active action bar entry logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other action bar management
    functions to determine the proper behavior of UI elements and game actions. The
    ActiveStates enumeration may vary depending on the specific implementation within
    TrinityCore's action bar system.
