documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the texture kit identifier associated with the conversation.
  description: The GetTextureKitId method returns the unique identifier of the texture
    kit that is linked to this conversation. Texture kits in World of Warcraft define
    visual appearance properties such as UI elements, animations, and graphical assets
    used for specific in-game interactions. This method allows developers to access
    the texture kit ID for use in custom scripts or UI modifications related to conversations.
    The returned value typically corresponds to an entry in the game's texture kit
    database and may be used to apply appropriate visual styling or effects during
    conversation events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the texture kit identifier associated with this
    conversation. A value of 0 usually indicates no texture kit is assigned, while
    other values correspond to specific entries in the game's texture kit database.
  examples:

    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    int textureKitId = conv->GetTextureKitId();\n    // Use textureKitId\
      \ for UI or visual effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Conversation class which handles in-game dialogue
    and interaction sequences. The texture kit ID returned may be used to customize
    visual elements such as portraits, backgrounds, or other UI components during
    conversation events.
