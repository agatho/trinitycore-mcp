  method: UpdateMaxHealth
  signature: void Creature::UpdateMaxHealth()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum health value of the creature based on its current level
    and base health statistics.
  description: The UpdateMaxHealth method recalculates and sets the maximum health
    points for a Creature object. This function is typically invoked when a creature's
    level changes, or when its base health statistics are modified. It ensures that
    the creature's health pool accurately reflects its current state within the game
    world. The method internally uses the creature's level, base health values, and
    any applicable modifiers to compute the new maximum health. This update is essential
    for maintaining proper combat balance and ensuring that creatures scale appropriately
    with player progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating a creature's max health after level up
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->UpdateMaxHealth();

      // Health is now recalculated based on current level and base stats'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a custom AI behavior to adjust health dynamically
    code: "void CustomAI::OnLevelChange(uint32 newLevel)\n{\n    if (Creature* creature\
      \ = GetCreature())\n    {\n        creature->SetLevel(newLevel);\n        creature->UpdateMaxHealth();\n\
      \        creature->SetHealth(creature->GetMaxHealth()); // Restore health to\
      \ max\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically triggers a recalculation of the creature's health statistics
    using internal formulas that consider base health, level scaling, and any applicable
    modifiers. It may also update related fields such as current health if needed
    to maintain consistency. The method is usually called internally by the core engine
    when level changes occur, but can be invoked manually for custom behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context might lead to inconsistent
    creature states. Ensure that the creature's level and base statistics are properly
    set before calling this method. Avoid calling it in rapid succession during combat
    as it may cause visual glitches or performance issues.
