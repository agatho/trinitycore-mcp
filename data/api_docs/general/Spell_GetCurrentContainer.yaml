  method: GetCurrentContainer
  signature: CurrentSpellTypes Spell::GetCurrentContainer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current spell container type for the spell object
  description: This method retrieves the current spell container type associated with
    the spell object, which indicates how the spell is being processed or stored within
    the game system. The returned value represents the specific type of spell container
    that determines the behavior and processing rules for the spell. This is particularly
    useful when working with spell handling mechanisms, as it allows developers to
    understand the context in which a spell is being executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the CurrentSpellTypes enum value representing the current spell
    container type. Possible values include SpellContainerType::SPELL_CONTAINER_TYPE_NONE,
    SpellContainerType::SPELL_CONTAINER_TYPE_SPELL, and other related container types
    depending on the spell's context and processing state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);\nCurrentSpellTypes containerType\
      \ = spell->GetCurrentContainer();\nif (containerType == SPELL_CONTAINER_TYPE_SPELL)\n\
      {\n    // Handle spell container\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell processing and execution phases.
    It helps determine how the spell should be handled within the game system, particularly
    when dealing with different spell types or containers. The method itself does
    not modify any state but simply retrieves the current container type.
  warnings: The method should only be called when the spell object is properly initialized
    and has a valid container type set. Calling this method on uninitialized or invalid
    spell objects may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
