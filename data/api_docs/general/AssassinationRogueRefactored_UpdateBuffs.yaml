  class: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buffs and debuffs for the assassination rogue player.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing the
    state of all buffs and debuffs currently affecting the assassination rogue character.
    This includes checking expiration times, applying stat modifications, updating
    visual effects, and ensuring that buff/debuff stacks are properly maintained.
    The method typically runs during each update cycle or when specific conditions
    are met, such as casting a spell or applying a new effect. It ensures that the
    rogue's combat performance remains accurate to the game mechanics and player state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameUpdate()\n{\n    rogue.UpdateBuffs();\n    // Other update logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggered on Buff Application
    code: "void ApplyStealthBuff()\n{\n    // Apply stealth effect\n    rogue.ApplyBuff(stealthBuff);\n\
      \    // Immediately refresh all buffs to reflect new state\n    rogue.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core game loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior. Buffs
    are often managed through a linked list or container structure, so performance
    can depend on the number of active effects. Consider caching frequently accessed
    buff data to reduce redundant calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of normal update cycles may cause unexpected
    behavior in buff stacking, durations, or visual effects. Do not call UpdateBuffs()
    recursively or from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
