  class: EnergyChiResourceWindwalker
  method: Initialize
  signature: void EnergyChiResourceWindwalker::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the energy chi resource for a Windwalker class player bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up and configures the energy chi resource
    management system for a Windwalker class player bot within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot's AI
    behavior to ensure that the chi resource tracking, regeneration, and usage mechanics
    are properly established. It prepares the internal state of the resource system
    to accurately reflect the Windwalker's energy chi mechanics, including any class-specific
    behaviors such as chi generation rates, maximum chi capacity, and interaction
    with abilities like Spinning Crane Kick or Touch of Death.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'EnergyChiResourceWindwalker chiResource;

      Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      chiResource.Initialize(bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    It assumes that the Player object passed is valid and represents a Windwalker
    class character. The method internally handles setting up resource tracking, but
    does not perform any AI decision-making or ability usage logic.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and points
    to an actual Windwalker class character before calling this method.
