  signature: bool CombatAIIntegrator::IsWithinPerformanceLimits() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the combat AI integration is within performance limits.
  description: The IsWithinPerformanceLimits method evaluates whether the current
    combat AI integration is operating within acceptable performance thresholds. This
    check typically involves monitoring resource usage, processing time, or other
    metrics that could impact server performance. The method returns true if all performance
    constraints are satisfied, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining stable gameplay in World of Warcraft servers where excessive AI
    processing can lead to lag or server instability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat AI integration is within defined performance
    limits; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatAIIntegrator.IsWithinPerformanceLimits()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ normal AI processing\n    combatAIIntegrator.Update();\n} else {\n    // Reduce\
      \ AI complexity or skip updates\n    combatAIIntegrator.ReduceProcessing();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's AI system to dynamically
    adjust combat behavior based on server load. It may involve checking CPU usage,
    memory consumption, or frame time thresholds. The implementation details are not
    exposed in the public API but are critical for maintaining server performance
    under high player density or complex encounters.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method for logic that affects gameplay balance, as
    it's primarily designed for performance monitoring and throttling. Changes to
    performance limits should be carefully tested to avoid unintended impacts on combat
    responsiveness.
