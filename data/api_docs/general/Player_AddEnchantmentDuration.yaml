  signature: void Player::AddEnchantmentDuration(Item * item, int slot, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Adds enchantment duration to an item for the player.
  description: This method adds a specified enchantment duration to an item owned
    by the player. It is used to manage the time-based effects of enchantments on
    items, particularly when the enchantment duration needs to be updated or extended.
    The method operates on the item's enchantment slot and modifies the duration value
    for that specific enchantment. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper item enchantment behavior during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object whose enchantment duration will be modified.
      Must not be null.
  - name: slot
    description: The enchantment slot index (typically 0-3) that identifies which
      enchantment on the item will have its duration updated.
  - name: duration
    description: The new duration value in seconds that will be applied to the specified
      enchantment slot. Must be a positive integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nItem* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);\n\
      if (item)\n{\n    player->AddEnchantmentDuration(item, 0, 3600);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nItem* item = player->GetItemByGuid(12345);\n\
      if (item)\n{\n    // Add duration to a specific enchantment slot\n    int slot\
      \ = 1;\n    uint32 duration = 7200;\n    player->AddEnchantmentDuration(item,\
      \ slot, duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other enchantment management
    functions. It directly modifies the item's enchantment duration without affecting
    other gameplay mechanics. The method requires that the item be valid and not null,
    and should only be called when the player has the item equipped or in their inventory.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect enchantment durations
    being applied, potentially causing items to lose their enchantment effects prematurely
    or behave unexpectedly. Care must be taken when specifying slot indices to ensure
    they match the actual enchantment slots on the item.
