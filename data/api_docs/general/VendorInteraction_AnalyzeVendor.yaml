api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: AnalyzeVendor
  signature: VendorAnalysis VendorInteraction::AnalyzeVendor(uint32 vendorGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes vendor data for a given vendor GUID and returns detailed vendor
    analysis information.
  description: The AnalyzeVendor method retrieves and processes comprehensive information
    about a specific vendor identified by its unique Game Object Identifier (GUID).
    This function examines the vendor's inventory, pricing structures, reputation
    requirements, and other relevant attributes to provide a complete vendor profile.
    The method is typically used in game scripting or addon development to dynamically
    assess vendor capabilities and offerings. It performs internal lookups within
    the TrinityCore database and caches results for performance optimization. The
    returned VendorAnalysis object contains structured data that can be queried for
    various vendor properties such as item availability, pricing tiers, and faction
    requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique Game Object Identifier (GUID) of the vendor to analyze.
      This value must correspond to a valid GameObject of type VENDOR in the world
      database.
  returns: A VendorAnalysis object containing detailed information about the specified
    vendor, including item listings, pricing data, reputation requirements, and other
    vendor-specific attributes. Returns an empty or invalid VendorAnalysis if the
    vendor GUID is not found or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Analysis
    code: "VendorAnalysis analysis = vendorInteraction.AnalyzeVendor(12345);\nif (analysis.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Vendor has \" << analysis.GetItemQuantity() << \" items\
      \ available.\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Vendor Reputation Requirements
    code: "VendorAnalysis analysis = vendorInteraction.AnalyzeVendor(98765);\nif (analysis.HasReputationRequirement())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Required faction: \" << analysis.GetRequiredFaction()\
      \ << \", Min Rank: \" << analysis.GetMinReputationRank();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and may have performance implications
    when called frequently. The VendorAnalysis object returned is designed to be lightweight
    for repeated access but should not be used in high-frequency loops without caching.
    Implementation uses internal caching mechanisms to avoid redundant database queries
    for the same vendor GUID within a short time window.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent vendor GUID will return
    an empty VendorAnalysis object, which may lead to unexpected behavior if not properly
    validated. Ensure that vendor GUIDs are verified before calling this function
    in performance-critical code paths.
