  class: DiseaseManager
  method: GetDiseaseUptime
  signature: float DiseaseManager::GetDiseaseUptime()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total uptime percentage of diseases affecting
    the player.
  description: The GetDiseaseUptime method computes the cumulative time during which
    the player has been affected by disease effects, expressed as a percentage of
    total time. This value represents how much of the tracked period the player was
    under the influence of disease conditions. The method aggregates data from all
    active disease applications and their durations to determine this uptime metric.
    It is typically used for tracking player performance in PvP scenarios or for calculating
    disease-related statistics in game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the percentage of time the player has been affected
    by diseases, ranging from 0.0 (no disease uptime) to 100.0 (full disease uptime).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float uptime = diseaseManager->GetDiseaseUptime();

      printf("Player disease uptime: %.2f%%\n", uptime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tracking Example
    code: "if (diseaseManager->GetDiseaseUptime() > 75.0f)\n{\n    // Player has high\
      \ disease uptime, may indicate effective disease application\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      High disease uptime detected.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely maintains internal state tracking of disease applications
    and their durations. It may reset or update its calculations periodically based
    on game tick intervals or player activity. The returned value is typically smoothed
    over time to provide a more stable measurement.
  warnings: The method may return inaccurate values if called before sufficient disease
    data has been collected or if the underlying disease tracking system hasn't initialized
    properly. Ensure that disease effects are actually active and tracked before calling
    this method for meaningful results.
