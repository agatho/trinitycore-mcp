  class: FormationManager
  method: GetRoleSlotIndex
  signature: uint32 FormationManager::GetRoleSlotIndex(FormationRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the slot index associated with a specified formation role.
  description: The GetRoleSlotIndex method is used to determine the specific slot
    index within a formation that corresponds to a given FormationRole. This functionality
    is crucial for managing unit positioning and roles in group formations, such as
    those used by NPCs or player-controlled units in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    engine. The method typically maps predefined roles (like 'Leader', 'Tank', 'Healer')
    to their respective slot positions within the formation structure. It ensures
    proper alignment and coordination among units during group activities like raids,
    dungeons, or scripted events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the slot index assigned to the specified
    FormationRole. If the role is not recognized or has no associated slot, the method
    may return an invalid index (typically 0 or UINT32_MAX) depending on implementation
    details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "FormationManager* manager = ...;\nFormationRole role = FORMATION_ROLE_LEADER;\n\
      uint32 slotIndex = manager->GetRoleSlotIndex(role);\nif (slotIndex != UINT32_MAX)\n\
      {\n    // Use the slot index for positioning logic\n    printf(\"Leader role\
      \ is assigned to slot %u\\n\", slotIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that formation roles and their corresponding slot indices
    are predefined and managed internally by the FormationManager. It should be called
    after the formation has been initialized or configured with valid role mappings.
    The returned index is typically used in conjunction with other formation management
    methods to manipulate unit positioning.
  warnings: Ensure that the FormationRole parameter passed to this method is valid;
    passing an invalid or undefined role may result in unexpected behavior or incorrect
    slot indices. Also, be aware that slot indices are generally zero-based and may
    not directly correspond to array indices in all implementations.
