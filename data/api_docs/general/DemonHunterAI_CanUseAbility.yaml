  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool DemonHunterAI::CanUseAbility(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Demon Hunter AI can use a specified ability based on
    cooldowns, resource requirements, and game state conditions.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a Demon Hunter AI character is
    currently able to cast or activate a given spell or ability. It checks various
    in-game conditions such as cooldown status, mana or fury requirements, player
    state (e.g., stunned, rooted), and other relevant combat mechanics. This method
    is typically used by the AI system to make decisions about which abilities to
    use during encounters. The evaluation considers both immediate availability of
    the ability and broader contextual factors that may prevent its usage even if
    the spell itself is not on cooldown.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell or ability to check for usability.
      This corresponds to the Spell ID used in the TrinityCore database and must reference
      a valid Demon Hunter ability.
  returns: Returns true if the Demon Hunter AI can currently use the specified ability,
    considering all relevant game state conditions and resource requirements; returns
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (ai->CanUseAbility(204021)) {\n    // Use the ability\n    ai->DoCastVictim(204021);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Selection
    code: "if (ai->CanUseAbility(204021)) {\n    ai->DoCastVictim(204021); // Eye\
      \ Beam\n} else if (ai->CanUseAbility(198589)) {\n    ai->DoCastVictim(198589);\
      \ // Immolation Aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Demon Hunter AI system and integrates with TrinityCore's
    combat and spell handling systems. It may internally query the creature's current
    mana/fury levels, cooldown timers, and player status flags to determine usability.
    The implementation likely uses internal state tracking mechanisms specific to
    the Demon Hunter class.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid Demon Hunter ability;
    invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return values. This method
    should not be used as a direct replacement for manual cooldown checks in complex
    AI logic without considering additional contextual factors.
