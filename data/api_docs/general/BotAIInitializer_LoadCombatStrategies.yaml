  brief: Initializes and loads combat strategies for bot AI instances
  description: The LoadCombatStrategies method is responsible for initializing and
    loading all combat-related strategies that are applicable to bot AI behavior.
    This method typically sets up the decision-making framework that bots use during
    combat encounters, including target selection, spell casting priorities, movement
    patterns, and tactical behaviors. It ensures that each bot AI instance has access
    to the appropriate combat logic based on their class, specialization, and configured
    settings. The method is usually called during the initialization phase of bot
    AI systems and may be invoked multiple times if strategy configurations need to
    be refreshed or updated.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadCombatStrategies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the AI system has been properly initialized
    and configured. It may trigger internal data structure initialization that could
    impact performance if called excessively during runtime.
