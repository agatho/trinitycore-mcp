  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: GetActiveBotCount
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnerAdapter::GetActiveBotCount(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active bots in the specified zone.
  description: The GetActiveBotCount method retrieves the number of currently active
    bot characters within a given zone. This method is typically used by the bot spawning
    system to monitor and manage bot population levels across different zones. The
    returned count includes all bots that are currently spawned, initialized, and
    functioning within the specified zone. This information can be crucial for maintaining
    game balance and ensuring optimal performance by preventing excessive bot presence
    in any single area.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone for which to count active bots.
      Valid values are positive integers representing valid zone IDs within the game
      world.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of active bot characters currently
    present in the specified zone. Returns 0 if no bots are active or if the zone
    ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 botCount = botSpawnerAdapter->GetActiveBotCount(1234); // Get active
      bots in zone 1234
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Zone Bot Population
    code: "if (botSpawnerAdapter->GetActiveBotCount(5678) > 10)\n{\n    // Log warning\
      \ about high bot population\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: High bot population\
      \ in zone 5678\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation on internal data structures that
    track active bots. It is designed to be efficient and should not cause significant
    performance overhead during normal operation. The method assumes that the zone
    ID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing zone in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the zone ID passed to this method is valid, as invalid IDs
    may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect counts. This method does not validate
    zone existence internally, so callers should ensure proper validation before invoking
    it.
