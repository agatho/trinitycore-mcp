documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the database version information for the World instance.
  description: The LoadDBVersion method retrieves and stores the current database
    version from the database itself. This ensures that the server's database schema
    is compatible with the running core version. The method typically executes during
    server startup to validate that the database structure matches expected versions,
    preventing potential runtime errors due to schema mismatches. It may also perform
    minor version-specific adjustments or logging of the loaded version information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: 'World* world = World::instance();

      world->LoadDBVersion(); // Called during startup to load DB version'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during World initialization
    and should not be called manually unless specifically required for version checking.
    It may involve database queries that could impact startup time if the database
    is slow or under heavy load.
