  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateSocialEvent(int * leader, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a social event for a guild by managing the event leader and event
    identifier.
  description: The CoordinateSocialEvent method in the GuildEventCoordinator class
    is responsible for handling the coordination of social events within a guild.
    It takes a pointer to an integer representing the event leader and a uint32 identifier
    for the specific event type. This method likely manages event state transitions,
    player participation tracking, and ensures proper synchronization between the
    game server and clients during guild social activities such as guild parties or
    events. The method operates on the assumption that the provided leader pointer
    points to a valid player identifier within the guild context.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the player who is leading the social event. This value should point to a valid
      guild member's identifier.
  - name: eventId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific type of social
      event being coordinated. This ID typically maps to predefined event types within
      the TrinityCore guild system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int eventLeader = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint32 eventType = 1001;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateSocialEvent(&eventLeader, eventType);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild event tracking systems and
    may trigger notifications to other guild members. It is assumed that the leader
    parameter points to a valid guild member's GUID and that the eventId corresponds
    to a known social event type in the game database.
  warnings: Ensure that the leader pointer points to a valid player within the guild
    context, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The method does not validate
    if the event ID is registered or recognized by the server.
