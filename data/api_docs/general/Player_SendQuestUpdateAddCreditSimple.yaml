  method: SendQuestUpdateAddCreditSimple
  signature: void Player::SendQuestUpdateAddCreditSimple(const int & obj) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest update packet to the player indicating simple credit addition
    for a quest objective.
  description: The SendQuestUpdateAddCreditSimple method is used to notify the player's
    client about an update to a quest, specifically when a simple credit has been
    added for a quest objective. This method is typically invoked during quest progression
    when the player completes a task that contributes to quest completion but doesn't
    require complex tracking or item handling. The method sends a specific packet
    to the client that updates the quest log and progress indicators without requiring
    additional data synchronization. It's part of the core quest system mechanics
    in TrinityCore, ensuring that players receive immediate visual feedback about
    their quest progress.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: The object identifier representing the quest objective or quest ID
      for which credit is being added. This parameter typically corresponds to a quest
      entry from the database and determines which quest in the player's log should
      be updated with new progress information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void Player::HandleQuestObjectiveComplete(uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Mark\
      \ quest objective as complete\n    SendQuestUpdateAddCreditSimple(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Quest Completion Handler
    code: "void Player::OnQuestObjectiveComplete(Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (quest)\n\
      \    {\n        // Send update for the completed quest\n        SendQuestUpdateAddCreditSimple(quest->GetQuestId());\n\
      \        \n        // Additional logic for quest completion\n        // ...\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state to
    receive updates. The method does not perform any validation on the quest ID itself,
    so calling it with an invalid quest ID may result in undefined behavior or client-side
    errors. It's recommended to verify that the quest exists and is active before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper quest context may cause client-side
    issues or visual glitches. Ensure that the quest objective being credited actually
    belongs to a currently active quest for the player. This method should not be
    called from within critical sections or during state transitions where the player
    might be logging out or changing zones.
