  class: InterruptOptimizer
  method: AdjustPrioritiesForPerformance
  signature: void InterruptOptimizer::AdjustPrioritiesForPerformance()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts interrupt priorities based on performance metrics and combat conditions.
  description: The AdjustPrioritiesForPerformance method dynamically modifies the
    priority levels assigned to various interrupt abilities within the InterruptOptimizer
    class. This method evaluates current performance data, such as success rates,
    cooldown states, and combat efficiency, to optimize the sequence and urgency of
    interrupts during gameplay. It ensures that high-value interrupts are prioritized
    when conditions favor their effectiveness, while reducing priority for less effective
    or redundant interrupts. The method is typically invoked during active combat
    scenarios to maintain optimal interrupt usage based on real-time performance feedback.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'InterruptOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.AdjustPrioritiesForPerformance();

      // Updates interrupt priorities based on current combat state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during active combat, ideally
    at regular intervals or upon specific performance triggers. It modifies internal
    priority structures and should not be used in isolation without proper context
    of the current combat scenario.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid combat context may lead to incorrect
    priority adjustments. Ensure that all relevant performance metrics are properly
    initialized before invoking this function.
