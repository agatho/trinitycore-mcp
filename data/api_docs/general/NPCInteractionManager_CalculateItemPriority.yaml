  signature: float NPCInteractionManager::CalculateItemPriority(const ItemTemplate
    * itemTemplate) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a priority value for an item based on its template
    for NPC interaction purposes.
  description: The CalculateItemPriority method determines a floating-point priority
    score for a given item template, which is used by the NPCInteractionManager to
    prioritize items during interactions such as vendor transactions, quest rewards,
    or loot distribution. This calculation typically considers factors like item rarity,
    value, level requirements, and potential utility within the game context. The
    method is designed to be called internally by the interaction manager and does
    not require external parameters beyond the item template itself. It assumes that
    the input item template is valid and properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated priority of the item. Higher
    values indicate higher priority, with typical ranges between 0.0 (lowest) and
    1.0 (highest), though values may exceed 1.0 depending on implementation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "const ItemTemplate* item = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nfloat priority\
      \ = npcInteractionManager.CalculateItemPriority(item);\nif (priority > 0.8f)\
      \ {\n    // Handle high-priority item\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other internal logic to determine
    item handling during NPC interactions, such as determining which items should
    be offered first or prioritized for purchase. Performance-wise, it should be lightweight
    since it only processes item template data without complex computations.
