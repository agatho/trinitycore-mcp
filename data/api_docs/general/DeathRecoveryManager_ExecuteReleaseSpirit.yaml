  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::ExecuteReleaseSpirit()
documentation:
  brief: Releases the player's spirit from death and returns them to life.
  description: The ExecuteReleaseSpirit method handles the core logic for reviving
    a player character after death in World of Warcraft. It manages the transition
    from the dead state back to living status, including updating player statistics,
    restoring health and mana, and potentially resetting certain game mechanics such
    as resurrection timers or soulstone cooldowns. This method is typically invoked
    during the death recovery process when a player is ready to be resurrected either
    through natural means, corpse retrieval, or by a priest's resurrection spell.
    The method ensures that all necessary state changes are properly applied to bring
    the character back into active gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spirit release was successfully executed and the player
    has been revived; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid state,
    missing data, or other internal errors during the resurrection process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death recovery context
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.ExecuteReleaseSpirit()) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ revived\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have been resurrected.\");\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Revival failed\n    player->SendNotification(\"Resurrection\
      \ failed. Please try again later.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal death recovery system and should not
    be called directly by external modules without proper validation. It assumes that
    all preconditions for resurrection have already been checked, such as whether
    the player is actually dead and has a valid corpse or spirit state. The method
    may also trigger additional events or callbacks related to resurrection effects.
  warnings: Calling this method when the player is not in a valid death state can
    lead to undefined behavior or game state corruption. Always verify that the player's
    current status allows for resurrection before invoking this function.
