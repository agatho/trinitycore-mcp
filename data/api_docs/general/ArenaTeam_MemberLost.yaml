  signature: void ArenaTeam::MemberLost(Player * player, uint32 againstMatchmakerRating,
    int32 MatchmakerRatingChange)
documentation:
  brief: Updates arena team statistics when a member loses a match, adjusting ratings
    and matchmaker rating changes.
  description: The MemberLost method is responsible for handling the logic that occurs
    when an arena team member loses a match. It updates the player's personal rating,
    adjusts the team's overall rating based on the match outcome, and modifies the
    matchmaker rating change value. This function is typically invoked during arena
    match processing to ensure accurate tracking of player performance and team rankings
    within the game's competitive system. The method takes into account the opponent's
    matchmaker rating to calculate appropriate rating adjustments for both the losing
    player and the arena team as a whole.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the member who lost the
      match. Must be a valid player instance that is part of the arena team.
  - name: againstMatchmakerRating
    description: The matchmaker rating of the opponent team or player against whom
      the member lost. Used to calculate proper rating adjustments based on the relative
      skill levels.
  - name: MatchmakerRatingChange
    description: The change in matchmaker rating that should be applied to the player's
      rating. Can be positive or negative depending on whether the player gained or
      lost rating points.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena match processing
    code: "void HandleArenaLoss(Player* player, uint32 opponentRating, int32 ratingChange)\n\
      {\n    arenaTeam->MemberLost(player, opponentRating, ratingChange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating team statistics after a ranked match
    code: "void ProcessArenaMatchResult(ArenaTeam* team, Player* loser, uint32 opponentRating)\n\
      {\n    int32 ratingChange = CalculateRatingChange(loser->GetArenaPersonalRating(),\
      \ opponentRating);\n    team->MemberLost(loser, opponentRating, ratingChange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core arena system and should only be called when
    a valid arena match has concluded. It assumes that the player is already verified
    as a member of the arena team. The method internally handles updating both individual
    player statistics and overall team statistics, including rating recalculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is not null and that the player actually
    belongs to the arena team before calling this method. Incorrect usage may lead
    to inconsistent rating calculations or invalid team data.
