  signature: void CreatureAI::OnAuraApplied(const AuraApplication * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an aura is applied to the creature.
  description: The OnAuraApplied method is a virtual callback function in the CreatureAI
    class that is invoked whenever an aura (buff or debuff) is successfully applied
    to the creature. This method allows custom AI behavior to be implemented in response
    to aura application events, such as triggering specific actions, modifying creature
    state, or initiating combat behaviors. The method receives a pointer to the AuraApplication
    object which contains information about the aura being applied, including its
    spell ID, duration, and target. This event is part of the TrinityCore's AI system
    and can be overridden in custom creature AI implementations to provide unique
    behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura that
      was applied to the creature. This object contains details about the aura such
      as spell information, duration, and application state.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnAuraApplied(const\
      \ AuraApplication* auraApp) override\n    {\n        // Check if the applied\
      \ aura is a specific buff\n        if (auraApp->GetBase()->GetSpellInfo()->Id\
      \ == 12345)\n        {\n            // Perform custom behavior when this aura\
      \ is applied\n            Talk(0);\n        }\n    }\n};"

    code: "class AdvancedCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnAuraApplied(const\

      \ me->GetMaxPower(POWER_MANA));\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"

  notes: The OnAuraApplied method is called during the aura application process, so
    it's important to avoid modifying the aura or creature state in ways that could
    cause recursion or instability. The AuraApplication parameter should not be stored
    as a member variable since it may become invalid after the method completes. This
    method is part of the creature AI lifecycle and is only invoked when the creature
    actually receives an aura application.
  warnings: Do not call RemoveAura() or similar methods directly on the creature from
    within this callback, as it may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Avoid performing
    heavy computations in this method as it's called frequently during gameplay. Be
    cautious about modifying the creature's state that might affect other systems,
    as this can lead to unexpected AI behavior.
