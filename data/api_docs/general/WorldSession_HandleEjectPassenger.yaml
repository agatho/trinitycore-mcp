  class: WorldSession
  method: HandleEjectPassenger
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleEjectPassenger(WorldPackets::Vehicle::EjectPassenger
    & ejectPassenger)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the ejecting of a passenger from a vehicle in the World of Warcraft
    client.
  description: The HandleEjectPassenger method processes incoming packets from players
    attempting to eject themselves or other passengers from a vehicle they are currently
    riding. This method is part of the TrinityCore server's vehicle management system
    and ensures proper synchronization between the client and server when passengers
    are removed from vehicles. The method validates that the player has a valid vehicle
    seat assignment and that the eject request is legitimate before proceeding with
    the removal process.
  parameters:
  - name: ejectPassenger
    description: A reference to a WorldPackets::Vehicle::EjectPassenger packet containing
      the details of the passenger eject request, including the target passenger's
      GUID and vehicle information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Eject Passenger Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleEjectPassenger(WorldPackets::Vehicle::EjectPassenger&\
      \ ejectPassenger)\n{\n    // Validate vehicle and passenger state\n    if (!GetPlayer()->IsInVehicle()\
      \ || !ejectPassenger.PassengerGuid)\n        return;\n\n    // Eject the passenger\
      \ from the current vehicle\n    GetPlayer()->GetVehicleBase()->EjectPassenger(ejectPassenger.PassengerGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player sends an eject packet through
    the client UI. It's important to note that this method only handles the server-side
    logic for ejecting passengers and does not directly send confirmation packets
    back to the client; that responsibility lies with the vehicle system itself.
