  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: UpdateObstacle
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::UpdateObstacle(const ObstacleInfo & obstacle)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state of an obstacle within the avoidance manager.
  description: The UpdateObstacle method is responsible for refreshing or modifying
    the properties of a given obstacle in the obstacle avoidance system. This method
    ensures that the AI-controlled units can accurately navigate around dynamic obstacles
    by keeping their internal obstacle data synchronized with the current game state.
    It typically handles updates to position, size, and other relevant attributes
    of the obstacle. The method may be called during pathfinding calculations or when
    obstacle properties change during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: A constant reference to an ObstacleInfo object containing updated
      information about the obstacle, including its position, dimensions, and other
      relevant properties that need to be reflected in the avoidance system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating an obstacle's position
    code: 'ObstacleInfo newObstacle;

      newObstacle.position = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      newObstacle.size = {5.0f, 5.0f, 5.0f};

      manager.UpdateObstacle(newObstacle);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating an obstacle during pathfinding
    code: "if (obstacleHasChanged)\n{\n    ObstacleInfo updatedObstacle = GetUpdatedObstacleInfo();\n\
      \    manager.UpdateObstacle(updatedObstacle);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the AI update loop or when obstacle
    events occur in the game world. It's important to ensure that the ObstacleInfo
    object passed to this method contains valid and up-to-date data, as incorrect
    values may lead to navigation failures or unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling UpdateObstacle with invalid or uninitialized ObstacleInfo data
    can cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all obstacle properties are properly
    initialized before calling this method.
