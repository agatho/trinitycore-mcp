  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteUseItem
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteUseItem(Player * bot, const
    BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and executes a bot's action to use a specified item.
  description: The ExecuteUseItem method handles the logic for a bot to use an item
    from its inventory. It validates that the item is usable, checks if the bot has
    sufficient resources or conditions to use it, and then performs the appropriate
    action such as consuming a potion, equipping gear, or activating a quest item.
    This method is part of the BotActionProcessor's core functionality for managing
    automated player actions in the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the action.
  - name: action
    description: Reference to a BotAction structure containing details about the item
      to be used, including item ID and target information.
  returns: Returns a BotActionResult enum indicating whether the action was successful,
    failed, or resulted in an error. Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED,
    INVALID_TARGET, or NOT_ENOUGH_RESOURCES.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ExecuteUseItem
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_USE_ITEM;\naction.itemId =\
      \ 12345;\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteUseItem(bot, action);\n\
      if (result == BOT_ACTION_SUCCESS) {\n    // Item used successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot's inventory and item data are properly initialized.
    It does not handle item cooldowns or complex interactions with other systems such
    as quest progression or combat state changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAction contains valid item data before calling this
    method, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior or failure to execute the
    intended action.
