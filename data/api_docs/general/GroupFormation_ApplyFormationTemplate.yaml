documentation:
  brief: Applies a formation template to a group, configuring member positioning and
    behavior.
  description: The ApplyFormationTemplate method configures the positioning and movement
    behavior of group members according to a specified FormationTemplate. This method
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage how players
    or creatures within a group should position themselves relative to each other
    during combat or movement. The formation template defines specific rules for spacing,
    orientation, and positioning that are applied to all members of the group. This
    functionality supports advanced group mechanics such as tanking formations, ranged
    DPS positioning, or coordinated movement patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: formationTemplate
    description: A constant reference to a FormationTemplate object that defines the
      positioning and behavior rules for the group members. The template contains
      data about relative positions, angles, and movement constraints that will be
      applied to all group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Applying a Basic Formation Template
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      FormationTemplate template;

      template.SetFormationType(FORMATION_TYPE_TANK);

      template.SetSpacing(2.0f);

      template.SetAngle(0.0f);

      formation->ApplyFormationTemplate(template);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying a Custom Formation Template with Dynamic Values
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      FormationTemplate template;

      template.SetFormationType(FORMATION_TYPE_DPS);

      template.SetSpacing(3.5f);

      template.SetAngle(M_PI_2); // 90 degrees

      formation->ApplyFormationTemplate(template);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the group formation and may affect
    movement calculations for all members. It should be called when the group's tactical
    setup needs to change, such as during combat phase transitions or when a new leader
    assigns a specific formation. The method does not validate whether the formation
    template is compatible with current group composition or member capabilities.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group without proper initialization may lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect positioning. Ensure that the FormationTemplate
    passed contains valid values for spacing and angle parameters, as invalid values
    may cause members to occupy overlapping or unreachable positions.
