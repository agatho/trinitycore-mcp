documentation:
  brief: Handles a null packet received from the client, typically used for synchronization
    or placeholder operations.
  description: The Handle_NULL method is a placeholder handler in the WorldSession
    class that processes incoming null packets from clients. These packets are often
    sent for synchronization purposes or as placeholders when no actual data needs
    to be transmitted. The method does not perform any significant operations but
    serves as a hook for potential future functionality or client-side protocol handling.
    It may also be used to maintain connection liveness or detect disconnections in
    certain scenarios.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::Handle_NULL(WorldPackets::Null& null)\n{\n    // Placeholder\
      \ handler - does nothing\n    // Used for synchronization or protocol maintenance\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically registered as a handler for specific packet types
    that are either unused or reserved for future implementation. It's important to
    note that while it currently does nothing, it may be extended in the future to
    perform meaningful operations such as connection health checks or protocol version
    validation.
