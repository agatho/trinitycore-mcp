documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a gossip menu item by its order index from the current gossip menu.
  description: The GetItemByIndex method fetches a specific GossipMenuItem from the
    gossip menu based on its position (order index) within the menu. This is useful
    when iterating through or accessing specific items in a dynamic gossip menu, particularly
    when the menu structure changes during runtime. The method performs a lookup using
    the provided order index and returns a pointer to the corresponding menu item.
    If the specified index is out of bounds, the method may return a null pointer
    or throw an exception depending on implementation details. This functionality
    is commonly used in quest gating, conditional gossip options, and dynamic menu
    construction within TrinityCore's NPC interaction system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the GossipMenuItem at the specified order index, or
    nullptr if the index is invalid or out of bounds.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a specific gossip menu item by index
    code: "GossipMenu* menu = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGossipMenu();\n\
      const GossipMenuItem* item = menu->GetItemByIndex(2);\nif (item != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process the menu item\n    sLog->outString(\"Found menu item: %s\"\
      , item->m_text.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all gossip menu items using GetItemByIndex
    code: "GossipMenu* menu = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGossipMenu();\n\
      uint32 itemCount = menu->GetMenuItemCount();\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i < itemCount;\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    const GossipMenuItem* item = menu->GetItemByIndex(i);\n    if\
      \ (item != nullptr)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Menu Item %u: %s\", i,\
      \ item->m_text.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GossipMenu has been properly initialized and
    populated with items. The order index corresponds to the sequential position of
    menu items within the internal data structure. Be cautious when using this method
    in multithreaded environments where the gossip menu might be modified concurrently.
  warnings: Using an invalid or out-of-bounds index can result in a null pointer return,
    which should always be checked before dereferencing. This method does not validate
    the index range internally, so callers must ensure valid indices are passed to
    avoid undefined behavior.
