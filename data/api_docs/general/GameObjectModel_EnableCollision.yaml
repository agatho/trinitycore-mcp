  method: EnableCollision
  signature: void GameObjectModel::EnableCollision(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables collision detection for the game object model.
  description: The EnableCollision method controls whether collision detection is
    active for a GameObjectModel instance. When enabled, the model will participate
    in physics-based collision checks with other objects in the game world. This is
    essential for interactive elements like doors, gates, or any object that players
    or creatures should be able to collide with. The method directly modifies an internal
    flag within the GameObjectModel class that determines if collision routines are
    executed during movement and interaction processing.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      collision detection for this game object model.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable collision on a door GameObjectModel
    code: "GameObjectModel* doorModel = ...; // Assume this is initialized\n doorModel->EnableCollision(true);\
      \ // Enable collision for the door"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable collision for a temporary interactive object
    code: "GameObjectModel* tempObject = ...;\n tempObject->EnableCollision(false);\
      \ // Disable collision so it can be walked through\n // Later, re-enable when\
      \ needed:\n tempObject->EnableCollision(true);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the collision behavior of the specific GameObjectModel
    instance. It does not modify the underlying GameObject data or its position in
    the world. The change takes effect immediately upon calling the method, and subsequent
    movement or interaction checks will respect the new collision state.
  warnings: Disabling collision on important interactive objects like doors or gates
    may cause players to walk through them, breaking gameplay expectations. Ensure
    that disabling collision is intentional and does not negatively impact player
    experience or game mechanics.
