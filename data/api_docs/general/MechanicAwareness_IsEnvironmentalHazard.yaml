  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: IsEnvironmentalHazard
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::IsEnvironmentalHazard(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position represents an environmental hazard in
    the game world.
  description: The IsEnvironmentalHazard method evaluates a specified position within
    the game world to determine if it corresponds to an environmental hazard such
    as lava, deep water, or other dangerous terrain features. This functionality is
    crucial for AI behavior and player safety systems, particularly when pathfinding
    or determining safe zones. The method likely checks against predefined hazard
    zones or terrain properties associated with the game map. It is typically used
    by NPC AI and game mechanics to avoid placing units in harmful areas or to trigger
    appropriate responses when units enter hazardous regions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: A reference to an integer value representing a position identifier
      or coordinate within the game world. This parameter likely corresponds to a
      specific location index, tile coordinate, or zone identifier that maps to environmental
      hazard data.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is classified as an environmental
    hazard; otherwise returns false. The method may return false for valid positions
    that are not marked as hazardous or when the position parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a position is hazardous
    code: "int playerPosition = 12345;\nif (mechanicAwareness.IsEnvironmentalHazard(playerPosition))\
      \ {\n    // Handle hazardous position - e.g., warn player or prevent movement\n\
      \    printf(\"Warning: Position %d is an environmental hazard!\\n\", playerPosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI pathfinding to avoid hazardous areas
    code: "class EnemyAI {\npublic:\n    bool FindSafePath(int start, int end) {\n\
      \        // Check if any part of the path is hazardous\n        for (int i =\
      \ start; i <= end; ++i) {\n            if (mechanicAwareness.IsEnvironmentalHazard(i))\
      \ {\n                return false; // Path contains hazard\n            }\n\
      \        }\n        return true; // All positions safe\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely optimized for performance as it may be called frequently
    during AI calculations and pathfinding operations. The underlying implementation
    probably uses spatial indexing or lookup tables to quickly determine hazard status
    without expensive computations. Developers should ensure that the position parameter
    is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: The method signature shows a reference to an integer, which might be misleading
    if the parameter is expected to be passed by value. This could lead to confusion
    in usage patterns. Additionally, incorrect position values may result in false
    positives or negatives, so proper validation should be performed before calling
    this method.
