  brief: Cleans up player resources before deletion
  description: This method performs cleanup operations on a player object before it
    is fully removed from memory. It handles various internal processes such as removing
    the player from the world, clearing references, and ensuring proper resource deallocation.
    The method is typically called during player destruction or when the player is
    being removed from the game world. This cleanup process is essential for preventing
    memory leaks and maintaining game stability.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      // ... perform operations ...

      player->CleanupsBeforeDelete(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before a player object is destroyed to ensure
    proper cleanup. It's typically invoked automatically during player deletion process,
    but can also be manually triggered in specific scenarios.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to memory leaks or crashes if not
    handled correctly. The finalCleanup parameter determines whether this is the final
    cleanup or a temporary one.
