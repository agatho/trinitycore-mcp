  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastFireBreath
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastFireBreath(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts a fire breath spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastFireBreath method executes the evoker's fire breath ability,
    targeting a specific unit identified by the input parameter. This method is typically
    invoked during AI behavior execution to perform offensive spellcasting. The implementation
    likely handles spell casting mechanics such as line-of-sight checks, mana costs,
    and cooldown management. It may also manage the visual effects and damage application
    associated with the fire breath attack.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier.
      The value should correspond to a valid GameObject or Creature GUID within the
      current map context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastFireBreath(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the evoker unit has sufficient mana and is within
    casting range of the target. The actual spell effect and damage calculation are
    handled by the core TrinityCore spell system, not directly within this AI method.
  warnings: Ensure the target pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    undefined behavior. This method does not perform any validation on the target's
    existence or validity, so callers must ensure proper preconditions are met.
