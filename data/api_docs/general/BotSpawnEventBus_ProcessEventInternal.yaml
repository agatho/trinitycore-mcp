documentation:
  brief: Processes a bot spawn event internally within the event bus system
  description: The ProcessEventInternal method handles the internal processing of
    a bot spawn event by routing it through the event bus infrastructure. This method
    is typically invoked when a new bot needs to be spawned or managed within the
    TrinityCore environment, ensuring proper coordination with other systems such
    as AI behavior, player interaction, and game state management. It processes the
    event asynchronously and may trigger additional callbacks or notifications depending
    on the event type and current system configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A shared pointer to a BotSpawnEvent object containing details about
      the bot spawn operation including bot ID, spawn location, and associated metadata.
      The event must be valid and properly initialized before being passed to this
      method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ProcessEventInternal
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSpawnEvent> spawnEvent = std::make_shared<BotSpawnEvent>(botId,
      position);

      bus.ProcessEventInternal(spawnEvent);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Event Processing with Error Checking
    code: "if (spawnEvent)\n{\n    bus.ProcessEventInternal(spawnEvent);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid event case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block the calling
    thread for extended periods. It relies on internal queues or asynchronous dispatch
    mechanisms to handle events efficiently without impacting game performance.
