  brief: Resyncs the player's rune cooldowns and energy levels after a combat reset.
  description: The ResyncRunes method resets the player's rune cooldowns and energy
    levels to their maximum values, effectively clearing any active cooldowns or energy
    restrictions that may have been applied during combat. This method is typically

    need to be reset to their initial state. It ensures that all runes are available
    for use immediately after the reset, allowing for proper gameplay mechanics and
    preventing potential issues with rune usage during combat situations.
