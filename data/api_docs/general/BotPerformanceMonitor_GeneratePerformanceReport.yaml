    const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance report for bot operations and stores it in the provided
    string reference.
  description: The GeneratePerformanceReport method compiles detailed performance
    metrics and statistics related to bot behavior, resource usage, and operational
    efficiency. It aggregates data from various subsystems within the BotPerformanceMonitor
    class and formats this information into a structured report string. This method
    is typically invoked when administrators or developers need to analyze bot performance
    for optimization purposes. The generated report includes timing data, memory consumption,
    CPU utilization, and other relevant metrics that help identify bottlenecks or
    areas for improvement in bot operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::string report;

      botPerformanceMonitor.GeneratePerformanceReport(report);

      std::cout << "Performance Report:\n" << report << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Performance Data
    code: "void LogBotPerformance()\n{\n    std::string performanceReport;\n    botPerformanceMonitor.GeneratePerformanceReport(performanceReport);\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot Performance Report:\\n%s\", performanceReport.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread
    context. The report string is populated with formatted data that includes timestamps,
    metric names, and their corresponding values. It's recommended to call this method
    periodically rather than continuously to avoid performance overhead.
  warnings: The generated report may contain sensitive operational data that should
    be handled appropriately. Ensure proper access controls are in place when exposing
    or logging these reports in production environments.
