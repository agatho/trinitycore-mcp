  class: PositionManager
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 PositionManager::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds used by the PositionManager for
    position synchronization.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the configured time interval,
    measured in milliseconds, that determines how frequently position updates are
    processed or sent by the PositionManager. This value is typically used in network
    synchronization to control the frequency of player or object position broadcasts
    to clients. The interval may be dynamically adjusted based on server load or configuration
    settings. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from
    any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. A return
    value of 0 typically indicates that updates are disabled or the manager has not
    been initialized with a valid interval.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 interval = positionManager.GetUpdateInterval();\nif (interval >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Use interval for scheduling position updates\n    printf(\"\
      Position update interval: %u ms\\n\", interval);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Update Timer
    code: "class MyPositionHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void OnUpdate(uint32 diff)\n \
      \   {\n        if (diff >= positionManager.GetUpdateInterval())\n        {\n\
      \            // Perform position update logic here\n            positionManager.UpdatePositions();\n\
      \        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    PositionManager positionManager;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with game loop timing systems
    to ensure that position updates occur at consistent intervals. The returned value
    may be influenced by server configuration options or runtime adjustments made
    by the TrinityCore system.
