  class: BattlefieldScript
  method: BattlefieldScript
  signature: void BattlefieldScript::BattlefieldScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BattlefieldScript instance with the specified name.
  description: The BattlefieldScript constructor initializes a new instance of the
    BattlefieldScript class, associating it with a specific battlefield name. This
    method sets up the script's internal state and prepares it for use within the
    TrinityCore framework's battlefield system. The name parameter typically corresponds
    to a registered battlefield type or zone identifier that the script will handle.
    This initialization is crucial for proper integration with the game's battlefield
    management subsystem, ensuring that the script can respond to battlefield events
    and manage player interactions correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string specifying the name of the battlefield this
      script instance will handle. This should correspond to a valid battlefield type
      identifier registered with the TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BattlefieldScript Initialization
    code: "class AlteracValleyScript : public BattlefieldScript\n{\npublic:\n    AlteracValleyScript()\
      \ : BattlefieldScript(\"Alterac Valley\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Battlefield Script Constructor
    code: "class WintergraspScript : public BattlefieldScript\n{\npublic:\n    WintergraspScript()\
      \ : BattlefieldScript(\"Wintergrasp\")\n    {\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ logic can go here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the module loading phase of TrinityCore.
    The name parameter must match a registered battlefield type in the database or
    configuration files. Developers should ensure that their script implementations
    properly handle the lifecycle events associated with the battlefield they are
    initialized for.
  warnings: Incorrectly named battlefield scripts may not be properly registered with
    the battlefield system, leading to missing event handling. The name parameter
    should exactly match the battlefield identifier used elsewhere in the TrinityCore
    codebase and database.
