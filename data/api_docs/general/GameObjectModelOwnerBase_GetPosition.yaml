  class: GameObjectModelOwnerBase
  method: GetPosition
  signature: int GameObjectModelOwnerBase::GetPosition() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the position identifier of the game object model owner.
  description: The GetPosition method returns an integer identifier representing the
    current position of the GameObjectModelOwnerBase instance within the game world.
    This identifier is typically used to uniquely identify the location or state of
    a game object model, particularly in relation to spatial queries, collision detection,
    and positioning logic. The returned value may correspond to a specific index,
    coordinate, or internal state marker depending on how the GameObjectModelOwnerBase
    is implemented and utilized within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the position identifier of the game object model
    owner. This value typically corresponds to an internal index or state marker used
    for spatial referencing and positioning within the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GameObjectModelOwnerBase* modelOwner = ...;

      int position = modelOwner->GetPosition();

      // Use position value for further processing

      printf("Object position: %d\n", position);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system managing game object models
    and their spatial relationships. The exact meaning of the returned integer depends
    on the implementation context within TrinityCore's GameObjectModel framework.
