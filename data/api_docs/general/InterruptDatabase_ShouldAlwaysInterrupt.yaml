  signature: bool InterruptDatabase::ShouldAlwaysInterrupt(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell should always be interrupted regardless of current
    combat state
  description: The ShouldAlwaysInterrupt method checks if a given spell ID is configured
    to always interrupt casting, irrespective of the caster's current combat status
    or other conditions. This functionality is typically used for spells that have
    special interrupt behavior, such as those that can interrupt any cast even in
    non-combat situations or spells with unique mechanics that override standard interrupt
    rules. The method queries an internal database or configuration structure containing
    spell-specific interrupt rules and returns true if the spell is marked for always-interrupt
    behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID should always be interrupted, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the spell's interrupt behavior overrides normal
    combat conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (sSpellMgr->ShouldAlwaysInterrupt(12345))\n{\n    // Handle special\
      \ interrupt logic\n    printf(\"Spell 12345 always interrupts\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses a cached database of spell interrupt rules. The
    implementation may involve lookup tables or configuration files that define which
    spells have special interrupt behavior. Performance is generally good as it's
    a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: Ensure the spell ID passed to this method is valid and exists in the database,
    otherwise results may be undefined or cause unexpected behavior. This method should
    not be used for general spell validation but specifically for interrupt logic
    decisions.
