documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current cooldown status of defensive abilities for a Demon
    Hunter player.
  description: The GetDemonHunterDefensiveCooldowns method is used to determine the
    cooldown state of a Demon Hunter's defensive abilities within the PvP combat AI
    system. This method evaluates the player's current defensive cooldowns and returns
    an integer value representing their status. The returned value typically indicates
    whether specific defensive abilities are on cooldown or available for use. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining proper PvP balance and ensuring that
    Demon Hunters can effectively manage their defensive resources during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the cooldown status of Demon Hunter defensive
    abilities. Positive values may indicate active cooldowns, while zero or negative
    values could signify availability or error conditions. The exact meaning of return
    values depends on internal implementation logic and should be interpreted according
    to the AI's cooldown tracking system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = player->GetPvPCombatAI();\nint cooldownStatus = ai->GetDemonHunterDefensiveCooldowns(nullptr);\n\
      if (cooldownStatus > 0) {\n    // Defensive abilities are on cooldown\n    printf(\"\
      Defensive cooldown active: %d seconds\\n\", cooldownStatus);\n} else if (cooldownStatus\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Defensive abilities are available\n    printf(\"Defensive\
      \ abilities ready to use\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvP combat AI system and relies on internal tracking
    of player cooldowns. The parameter is marked as const but may still modify internal
    state during execution. Developers should be aware that this method's behavior
    might vary depending on the specific Demon Hunter specialization and current combat
    situation.
  warnings: The method signature includes a pointer parameter that appears unused
    in the declaration (marked as 'int * player'). This could indicate either an incomplete
    implementation or a legacy parameter that is no longer required. Ensure proper
    handling of null pointers when calling this method, though the const nature suggests
    it should not modify the pointed-to value.
