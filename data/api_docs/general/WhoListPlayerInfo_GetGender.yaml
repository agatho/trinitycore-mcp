documentation:
  brief: Returns the gender of the player in the who list information.
  description: The GetGender method retrieves the gender identifier of a player as
    stored in the WhoListPlayerInfo structure. This value typically corresponds to
    predefined gender constants used within the TrinityCore framework, such as 0 for
    male, 1 for female, and potentially 2 for other gender variants if supported.
    The method is commonly used when processing or displaying who list data, allowing
    client-side code to determine the gender of players in the player list. This information
    is part of the player's public profile data that can be accessed without requiring
    additional database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A uint8 value representing the player''s gender: 0 for male, 1 for female,
    and potentially 2 for other gender variants if supported by the game version.
    The exact mapping may vary depending on the TrinityCore build and any custom modifications.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Who List Processing
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// Assume playerInfo is populated with data\n\
      uint8 gender = playerInfo.GetGender();\nif (gender == 0)\n{\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Player is male\" << std::endl;\n}\nelse if (gender == 1)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Player is female\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Gender in Player Display Logic
    code: "void DisplayWhoListEntry(WhoListPlayerInfo const& playerInfo)\n{\n    uint8\
      \ gender = playerInfo.GetGender();\n    std::string genderStr = (gender == 0)\
      \ ? \"Male\" : \"Female\";\n    std::cout << \"Name: \" << playerInfo.GetName()\
      \ << \", Gender: \" << genderStr << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly returns the internal gender
    field. It does not perform any validation or transformation of the stored value,
    so it's expected to return one of the standard gender identifiers used in the
    game engine. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from a const object.
