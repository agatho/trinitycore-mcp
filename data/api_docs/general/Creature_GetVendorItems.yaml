  method: GetVendorItems
  signature: const VendorItemData * Creature::GetVendorItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vendor item data for a creature's trading options.
  description: This method retrieves the VendorItemData structure that contains all
    items a creature offers for sale. The returned data includes item entries, costs,
    and other vendor-related information. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    the creature's vendor data to determine what items are available for purchase.
    This method is essential for implementing vendor functionality in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the VendorItemData structure containing all vendor
    items for this creature, or nullptr if no vendor data exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nconst VendorItemData* vendorData =\
      \ creature->GetVendorItems();\nif (vendorData)\n{\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i\
      \ < vendorData->GetItemCount(); ++i)\n    {\n        VendorItem const* item\
      \ = vendorData->GetItem(i);\n        // Process item\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during vendor setup or when retrieving vendor
    information for a creature. The returned pointer should not be deleted or modified,
    as it points to data managed by the creature's database. Performance considerations
    include checking if the creature actually has vendor data before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with creatures that may not have vendor
    data; always check for nullptr before accessing the returned data structure. Avoid
    modifying the returned VendorItemData directly as it may cause memory corruption
    or unexpected behavior.
