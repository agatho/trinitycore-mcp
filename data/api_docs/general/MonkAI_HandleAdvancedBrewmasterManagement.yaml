documentation:
  brief: Manages advanced Brewmaster monk abilities and cooldowns during combat.
  description: The HandleAdvancedBrewmasterManagement method is responsible for implementing
    sophisticated AI logic specific to Brewmaster monks within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method orchestrates the decision-making process for advanced abilities such
    as Fortifying Brew, Guard, and other defensive cooldowns based on current combat
    state, health levels, and enemy proximity. It evaluates the monk's resource management,
    including brew stacks and chi generation, while ensuring optimal usage of abilities
    according to game mechanics and class-specific strategies. The method integrates
    with the broader AI system to maintain effective combat performance for Brewmaster
    monks in both PvE and PvP scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_player->getClass() ==\
      \ CLASS_MONK)\n    {\n        if (auto* monkAI = dynamic_cast<MonkAI*>(this))\n\
      \        {\n            monkAI->HandleAdvancedBrewmasterManagement();\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the AI instance is properly initialized with valid target
    information and combat state. It relies on accurate health tracking and resource
    level detection to make informed decisions about ability usage. The implementation
    may vary based on specific TrinityCore version and patch updates.
  warnings: Improper initialization of the MonkAI class or missing target context
    can lead to incorrect behavior. Ensure that this method is only called when the
    monk is actively engaged in combat to avoid unnecessary processing.
