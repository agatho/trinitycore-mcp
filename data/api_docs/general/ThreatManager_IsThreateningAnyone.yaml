documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current ThreatManager is actively threatening any
    targets.
  description: This method checks if the ThreatManager has any active threat relationships
    with targets in the current zone. It returns true when the manager is actively
    maintaining threat, false otherwise. The method considers both active and inactive
    threats, including those that may be flagged as offline. This functionality is
    essential for determining whether a mob or player is currently engaged in combat,
    which affects various game mechanics such as combat state, aggro management, and
    AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ThreatManager has any active threat relationships with
    targets, false otherwise. The method may return false even when there are active
    threats but they are not being actively maintained.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (threatManager.IsThreateningAnyone())\n{\n    // Perform actions related\
      \ to threat\n    // e.g., attack target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other threat management
    functions to determine combat state. It may be called frequently during combat,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account when used in loops.
  warnings: This method does not distinguish between different types of threat (e.g.,
    direct vs indirect). Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction
    with other threat management functions to avoid misinterpretation of threat status.
