  method: GetAvailable
  signature: uint32 FrostRuneRunicPowerResource::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the amount of available runic power associated with frost runes.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current quantity of runic power
    that can be spent on frost rune abilities. This value represents the total runic
    power generated by frost runes, which is typically used in conjunction with other
    rune types to determine how much power is available for casting spells or abilities
    requiring runic power. The returned value is usually updated through game events
    such as rune regeneration or spell usage. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the amount of available runic power associated
    with frost runes. This value typically ranges from 0 to 1000, where 0 indicates
    no available power and higher values indicate more power available for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FrostRuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      uint32 availablePower = resource.GetAvailable();

      printf("Available frost rune runic power: %u\n", availablePower);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Power Before Casting
    code: "FrostRuneRunicPowerResource* frostResource = player->GetFrostRuneRunicPowerResource();\n\
      if (frostResource->GetAvailable() >= 50)\n{\n    // Cast a spell that requires\
      \ 50 runic power\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FROST_BLAST, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during game state updates or before casting
    abilities to ensure sufficient runic power is available. The value returned may
    be affected by buffs, debuffs, or class-specific modifiers that influence rune
    regeneration or power generation.
