  brief: Appends player banned notification data to a channel notify packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data related to a player being banned from a channel. This method
    is typically used internally by the TrinityCore server to construct and send appropriate
    network messages to clients when channel ban events occur. The method modifies
    the provided packet object in-place, adding the necessary fields to represent
    the ban notification. It does not return any value as it directly mutates the
    input parameter.

  - title: Basic usage in channel ban handling
    code: 'WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      PlayerBannedAppend appendObj;

      appendObj.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system in TrinityCore.
    It's designed to be called only when a player ban event needs to be communicated
    to clients through the channel notification mechanism. The method assumes that
    the input packet has been properly initialized and is ready to receive the ban-related
    data.
