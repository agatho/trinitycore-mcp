documentation:
  brief: Drops all database tables used by the playerbot migration system
  description: The DropAllTables method removes all existing database tables associated
    with the playerbot migration functionality. This operation is typically performed
    during system initialization or reset processes to ensure a clean state before
    recreating the necessary table structure. The method returns true if all tables
    were successfully dropped, or false if any table drop operation failed. This function
    is critical for maintaining database integrity when migrating playerbot data between
    different versions or resetting the migration system entirely.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all database tables were successfully dropped, false otherwise.
    The method will return false if any individual table drop operation fails or if
    there are no tables to drop.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DropAllTables
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->DropAllTables()) {\n    LOG_INFO(\"\
      playerbots\", \"Successfully dropped all playerbot migration tables\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\", \"Failed to drop playerbot migration tables\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a destructive operation on the database and should only
    be called when it's safe to lose existing playerbot migration data. The operation
    is typically used during system startup, reset procedures, or version upgrades
    where a clean slate is required.
  warnings: Calling this method will permanently delete all playerbot migration data
    from the database. Ensure that any important migration information has been backed
    up before invoking this function. This operation should not be performed during
    active gameplay sessions as it may cause unexpected behavior in playerbot systems.
