  signature: void Player::AddExploredZones(uint32 pos, uint64 mask)
documentation:
  brief: Adds explored zones to a player's quest log.
  description: 'This method adds explored zones to a player''s quest log by updating
    the explored zone bitmask. The method takes two parameters: pos (the position
    in the bitmask) and mask (the zone bitmask). This functionality is used primarily
    for tracking explored zones in the game world, allowing players to see which areas
    they have explored and can be used for various game mechanics such as quest completion
    or achievement unlocking.'
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position in the bitmask where the zone data should be added.
      This represents the index of the bit in the bitmask that corresponds to a specific
      zone.
  - name: mask
    description: The zone bitmask that contains the explored zone information. This
      is a 64-bit value representing the zones that have been explored by the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 pos = 0;

      uint64 mask = 1;

      player->AddExploredZones(pos, mask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage player exploration data. It should not be called directly in most cases
    as it's usually handled by game mechanics or quest systems. Performance considerations
    are minimal since this is a simple bit manipulation operation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect exploration tracking,
    which may affect quest completion or achievement progress. Care must be taken
    when using this method with different zone masks and positions.
