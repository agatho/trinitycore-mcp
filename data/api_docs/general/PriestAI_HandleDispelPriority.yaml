  method: HandleDispelPriority
  signature: bool PriestAI::HandleDispelPriority()
documentation:
  brief: Determines if the priest should prioritize dispelling a harmful magic effect
    on a target.
  description: The HandleDispelPriority method evaluates whether the current target
    or the priest's current focus target has a dispellable debuff that should be removed
    immediately. This method is typically called during the AI update cycle to determine
    if a dispel spell should be cast before other actions. It checks for specific
    types of harmful magical effects such as poison, disease, curse, and magic debuffs
    that can be removed by dispel spells like Abolish Disease or Mass Dispel. The
    method returns true if a suitable target with a dispellable effect is found, otherwise
    false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a dispellable harmful effect was found on the current target
    or focus target and should be prioritized for removal; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (HandleDispelPriority())\n    {\n        // Dispel\
      \ logic would be handled elsewhere\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Other AI\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Priest's AI decision-making process and should
    only be called when the priest has a valid target. The method does not actually
    cast any spells, but rather determines whether a dispel action should be prioritized.
