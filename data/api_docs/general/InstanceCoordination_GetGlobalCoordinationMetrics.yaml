  method: GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics
  signature: CoordinationMetrics InstanceCoordination::GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global coordination metrics for instance management and player
    synchronization.
  description: The GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics method returns a CoordinationMetrics
    object that contains aggregated statistics and performance data related to instance
    coordination across the server. This includes information about active instances,
    player counts, synchronization status, and resource usage. The returned metrics
    are used by the TrinityCore framework to monitor and optimize instance management
    systems, particularly in scenarios involving multiple players, raids, and world
    events. The method is typically called during server maintenance checks or performance
    monitoring routines to assess the overall health of the instance coordination
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CoordinationMetrics object containing global statistics about instance
    coordination including active instance counts, player synchronization data, and
    system resource metrics. Returns an empty or default-initialized CoordinationMetrics
    object if no coordination data is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Instance Metrics
    code: "InstanceCoordination* coordination = sWorld->GetInstanceCoordination();\n\
      CoordinationMetrics metrics = coordination->GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics();\n\
      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Active instances: %u, Players synced: %u\"\
      , \n            metrics.activeInstances, metrics.syncedPlayers);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Instance Coordination Performance
    code: "InstanceCoordination* coordination = sWorld->GetInstanceCoordination();\n\
      CoordinationMetrics metrics = coordination->GetGlobalCoordinationMetrics();\n\
      if (metrics.activeInstances > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"\
      High instance load detected: %u active instances\", \n                metrics.activeInstances);\n\
      }\nelse if (metrics.syncedPlayers < 10)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Low player synchronization: %u players synced\", \n                metrics.syncedPlayers);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive if called frequently due to
    its aggregation of global instance data. The returned CoordinationMetrics object
    is typically thread-safe for read operations, but modifications should be done
    through proper synchronization mechanisms. The metrics are updated periodically
    by the server's coordination system and may not reflect real-time changes.
  warnings: Calling this method in high-frequency loops can impact server performance.
    Avoid using it in time-critical code paths such as player movement handlers or
    combat routines. The returned data should be treated as a snapshot at the time
    of call and may become stale quickly in rapidly changing environments.
