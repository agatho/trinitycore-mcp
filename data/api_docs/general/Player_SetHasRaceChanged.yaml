documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's race change flag to indicate that a character race has
    been modified.
  description: This method marks the player object as having changed their race, which
    is typically used during character creation or when switching between different
    races. The function updates internal state flags within the Player class to reflect
    this change. It is commonly invoked when a player's race is altered through gameplay
    mechanics such as racial abilities or character customization options. This flag
    affects how certain game systems handle player data and may influence specific
    behaviors related to race-based abilities, appearance, and progression.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or variables within the Player
    class to track race changes. It should be used carefully during character creation
    processes and may impact how other systems interact with player data.
  warnings: 'Improper use of this method could lead to inconsistencies in player data
    handling, especially if not properly synchronized with related methods like SetRace
    or similar.
