documentation:
  brief: Unloads all loaded scripts from the ScriptMgr, releasing associated resources
    and clearing script registries.
  description: The Unload method in ScriptMgr is responsible for gracefully unloading
    all currently loaded scripts within the TrinityCore server environment. This function
    typically clears internal script registries, releases memory allocated for script
    objects, and ensures that no dangling references remain after script unloading.
    It's commonly invoked during server shutdown, script reloading processes, or when
    switching between different script configurations. The method does not take any
    parameters and performs no return operations. This operation is essential for
    maintaining server stability and preventing memory leaks when scripts are no longer
    needed or when new scripts need to be loaded.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Script Unloading

  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to unload all scripts, typically
    during server shutdown or controlled script reloading scenarios. Improper use
    during active gameplay may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
