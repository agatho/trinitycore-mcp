  class: BotScheduler
  method: CreateHardcorePattern
  signature: ActivityPattern BotScheduler::CreateHardcorePattern() const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a hardcore activity pattern for bot scheduling.
  description: The CreateHardcorePattern method generates a specific activity pattern
    designed for hardcore gameplay modes. This pattern typically defines strict scheduling
    rules that enforce intense, sustained bot activity with minimal downtime. The
    returned ActivityPattern object contains configuration settings such as work intervals,
    rest periods, and priority levels tailored for hardcore difficulty scenarios.
    This method is commonly used in automated bot systems to ensure consistent performance
    during challenging game modes.
  parameters: []
  returns: An ActivityPattern object representing the hardcore scheduling configuration.
    This pattern includes parameters like activity duration, cooldown periods, and
    execution priorities optimized for hardcore gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ActivityPattern hardcorePattern = scheduler.CreateHardcorePattern();

      // Use the pattern to configure bot behavior

      bot.SetActivityPattern(hardcorePattern);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot system is in a state suitable
    for hardcore mode configuration. The returned pattern may contain hardcoded values
    that are optimized for specific game mechanics and difficulty levels.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the scheduler may
    result in undefined behavior or invalid pattern configurations. Ensure the scheduler
    has been properly configured before invoking this method.
