documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another SharedInstanceLockData object into this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source SharedInstanceLockData object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate objects need to
    be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. The method ensures that
    the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move. In
    the context of TrinityCore's instance management system, this operator may be
    utilized when handling shared lock data for instance synchronization and access
    control mechanisms.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another SharedInstanceLockData object whose
      contents will be moved into this instance
  returns: A reference to the current SharedInstanceLockData object, allowing for
    chaining of assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic move assignment usage
    code: 'SharedInstanceLockData lock1;

      SharedInstanceLockData lock2 = std::move(lock1); // Uses move constructor

      // Or alternatively:

      lock1 = std::move(lock2); // Uses move assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move assignment in instance management context
    code: "void UpdateInstanceLock(SharedInstanceLockData& newLock) {\n    SharedInstanceLockData\
      \ currentLock;\n    // ... some logic ...\n    currentLock = std::move(newLock);\
      \ // Efficiently transfer lock data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and should
    be used carefully to avoid dangling references. The source object after a move
    operation should not be used unless explicitly reset or reassigned. In TrinityCore's
    context, this may affect instance lock state management and should be considered
    when implementing thread-safe access patterns.
  warnings: Using the move assignment operator on an already moved-from object results
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that objects are not used after being moved from
    to prevent memory corruption or unexpected locking states.
