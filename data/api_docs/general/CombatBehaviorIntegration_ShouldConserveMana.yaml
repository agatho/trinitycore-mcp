  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::ShouldConserveMana()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should conserve mana during combat.
  description: The ShouldConserveMana method evaluates current combat conditions and
    mana levels to decide if the AI character should prioritize mana conservation
    over aggressive spell usage. This decision is typically based on factors such
    as available mana percentage, spell cooldowns, and the threat level of the target.
    The method helps optimize resource management for AI-controlled characters in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should conserve mana (e.g., low mana or high threat),
    otherwise returns false to allow normal spell casting behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat logic
    code: "if (combatBehavior->ShouldConserveMana()) {\n    // Switch to defensive\
      \ abilities or low-mana spells\n    unit->CastSpell(target, DEFENSIVE_SPELL_ID);\n\
      } else {\n    // Proceed with normal offensive spell casting\n    unit->CastSpell(target,\
      \ OFFENSIVE_SPELL_ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the CombatBehaviorIntegration class and is typically
    called during AI decision-making cycles. It may be influenced by various combat
    state variables including current mana level, target health, and spell availability.
