documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the GuildIntegration class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the GuildIntegration
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application's
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global guild-related functionality
    and integration points within the TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer
    should be used carefully as it represents a shared resource that may be accessed
    concurrently by multiple systems. This method is thread-safe and designed to be
    called from any context where guild integration services are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of GuildIntegration. The method never
    returns NULL under normal operation, as it creates the instance on first call
    if it doesn't already exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GuildIntegration* guildInt = GuildIntegration::instance();\n// Use guildInt\
      \ to access guild integration methods\nif (guildInt)\n{\n    // Perform guild-related\
      \ operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Guild Methods
    code: "GuildIntegration* gi = GuildIntegration::instance();\n// Example of using\
      \ the singleton to perform a guild operation\nif (gi && gi->IsGuildEnabled())\n\
      {\n    // Perform guild-related tasks\n    gi->UpdateGuildData();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The instance is created on first call and persists for the lifetime of the application.
    Developers should avoid creating additional instances of GuildIntegration as this
    would violate the singleton contract.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer will remain valid across different
    execution contexts or after application shutdown. Also, be cautious when using
    this in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access to the singleton instance
    might occur.
