documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild member promotion request from a player
  description: Handles the client-initiated request to promote a guild member to a
    higher rank. This method validates that the requesting player has sufficient permissions
    to promote members, checks if the target player exists within the guild, and ensures
    the promotion adheres to guild rank hierarchy rules. The method updates the target
    player's guild rank in the database and broadcasts the promotion to all guild
    members. It is typically invoked when a guild officer or leader uses the guild
    management interface to promote another member.
  parameters:
  - name: promote
    description: A packet containing the target player's name and the new rank they
      should be promoted to
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic guild promotion handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildPromoteMember(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildPromoteMember&\
      \ promote)\n{\n    // Validate session and guild membership\n    if (!GetPlayer()\
      \ || !GetPlayer()->GetGuild())\n        return;\n    \n    // Process the promotion\
      \ logic\n    GetPlayer()->GetGuild()->HandlePromoteMember(GetPlayer(), promote);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of a WorldSession and assumes that
    proper authentication and authorization checks have already been performed. The
    actual rank update is delegated to the Guild class, which handles database persistence
    and broadcast notifications.
