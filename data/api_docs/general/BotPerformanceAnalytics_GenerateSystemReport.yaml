documentation:
  brief: Generates a comprehensive system performance report for bot analytics.
  description: The GenerateSystemReport method compiles detailed performance metrics
    and system information related to bot operations within the TrinityCore environment.
    This method aggregates data such as CPU usage, memory consumption, bot activity
    statistics, and other relevant system indicators into a structured report string.
    The generated report is intended for diagnostic purposes, allowing developers
    and administrators to monitor and optimize bot performance across the game server.
    The method does not require any input parameters and directly populates the provided
    output string with the formatted report data.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debugging and performance monitoring scenarios.
    It may involve system calls that could introduce slight overhead during execution.
    The report format is standardized but subject to change based on internal implementation
    details.
