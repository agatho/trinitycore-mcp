documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of performance regressions detected by the bot analytics
    system
  description: This method analyzes historical performance data collected by the BotPerformanceAnalytics
    system and identifies instances where performance has degraded compared to baseline
    measurements. It returns a vector of PerformanceComparison objects that contain
    detailed information about each regression, including metrics such as execution
    time, resource usage, and comparison timestamps. The method is typically used
    for monitoring bot behavior and identifying when automated agents are performing
    worse than expected. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance
    and ensuring bots operate within acceptable performance parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<PerformanceComparison> containing detailed information about
    detected performance regressions, including comparison metrics, timestamps, and
    performance degradation details. Returns an empty vector if no regressions are
    detected or if the analytics system has insufficient data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<PerformanceComparison>\
      \ regressions = analytics.GetPerformanceRegressions(10);\nfor (const auto& comparison\
      \ : regressions) {\n    std::cout << \"Regression detected at: \" << comparison.timestamp\
      \ << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Execution time: \" << comparison.executionTime\
      \ << \"ms\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Regressions
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<PerformanceComparison>\
      \ regressions = analytics.GetPerformanceRegressions(5);\nif (!regressions.empty())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << regressions.size() << \" performance regressions:\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < regressions.size(); ++i) {\n   \
      \     const auto& reg = regressions[i];\n        std::cout << \"  #\" << (i\
      \ + 1) << \": \" << reg.description << std::endl;\n    }\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No performance regressions detected.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on historical data collection that must be enabled and
    properly configured in the TrinityCore system. Performance comparisons are calculated
    based on predefined thresholds and baseline measurements stored in the analytics
    database. The returned vector is sorted by severity or timestamp depending on
    implementation details, typically with most severe regressions appearing first.
  warnings: This method may return an empty vector if no performance data has been
    collected yet or if the system has not detected any significant regressions. The
    PerformanceComparison objects should be handled carefully as they may contain
    references to internal data structures that could become invalid if the analytics
    system is reset or reconfigured during operation.
