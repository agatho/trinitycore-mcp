  method: AddAura
  signature: void PetAura::AddAura(uint32 petEntry, uint32 aura)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a specified aura to a pet with the given entry ID.
  description: 'The AddAura method is used to apply a specific aura effect to a pet
    in the World of Warcraft game environment. This method takes two parameters: the
    entry ID of the pet and the aura ID to be applied. It is typically used within
    the TrinityCore server framework to manage pet behavior, abilities, and status
    effects. The method operates on the pet''s aura system, which governs how pets
    interact with various magical effects and buffs. This functionality is essential
    for implementing pet-specific mechanics such as summoning spells, pet abilities,
    or temporary enhancements that affect the pet''s performance in combat or other
    game scenarios.'
  parameters:
  - name: petEntry
    description: The unique entry ID of the pet to which the aura will be applied.
      This corresponds to the creature_template entry ID for the specific pet type.
  - name: aura
    description: The aura ID that represents the spell effect or status condition
      to be added to the pet. This typically maps to an entry in the Spell.dbc file.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply a Healing Aura to a Pet
    code: PetAura::AddAura(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Add Multiple Auras to a Specific Pet
    code: 'PetAura::AddAura(54321, 11111);

      PetAura::AddAura(54321, 22222);

      PetAura::AddAura(54321, 33333);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's aura management system and may
    require that the pet is properly initialized before applying auras. The implementation
    might involve checking if the aura is compatible with the pet type, or if it conflicts
    with existing auras. Performance considerations should be noted when applying
    multiple auras to many pets simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that both petEntry and aura IDs are valid and exist in the database;
    invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or crashes. Applying conflicting auras
    might result in unexpected pet behavior or removal of previous effects.
