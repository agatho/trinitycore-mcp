api:
  class: SocialMgr
  method: BroadcastToFriendListers
  signature: void SocialMgr::BroadcastToFriendListers(Player * player, const WorldPacket
    * packet)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all players who have the specified player on their friend
    list.
  description: The BroadcastToFriendListers method is used in TrinityCore's SocialMgr
    class to deliver a specific WorldPacket to all online players who have the given
    player marked as a friend. This functionality supports the game's social system
    by enabling features such as group invitations, messages, or status updates that
    should only be visible to friends. The method iterates through the friend list
    of the specified player and sends the packet to each online friend. It does not
    send the packet to the originating player themselves. This is typically used for
    broadcasting social-related information across a player's friend network without
    flooding the entire server.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose friend list will be checked. This
      player is the source of the broadcast and will not receive the packet themselves.
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to a WorldPacket containing the data to be sent to all online
      friends of the specified player. The packet must be properly constructed before
      calling this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Group Invitation
    code: 'Player* inviter = ...; // Assume player is already initialized

      WorldPacket packet(SMSG_GROUP_INVITE);

      packet << uint8(0); // Invite status

      packet << std::string("Hello, join my group!");

      // Broadcast the invitation to all friends

      sSocialMgr->BroadcastToFriendListers(inviter, &packet);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a Custom Message to Friends
    code: 'Player* sender = ...;

      WorldPacket messagePacket(CMSG_MESSAGECHAT);

      messagePacket << uint32(CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL);

      messagePacket << uint32(0); // Language

      messagePacket << std::string("Hey friends!");

      sSocialMgr->BroadcastToFriendListers(sender, &messagePacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only sends packets to online players who are on the friend list.
    Offline players or those not in the friend list will not receive the packet. The
    implementation relies on internal player tracking and social system data structures,
    so performance can be affected by large friend lists or high server load. Ensure
    that the WorldPacket passed is valid and properly formatted before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Do not use this method to broadcast sensitive information without considering
    privacy implications. Since it sends packets to all online friends, it may expose
    data to unintended recipients if used inappropriately. Also, be cautious about
    packet size and frequency of calls to avoid network flooding or performance degradation.
