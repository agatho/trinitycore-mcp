  signature: void IBotSpawner::SpawnToPopulationTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Spawns bot instances to match the configured population target for the specified
    area or zone.
  description: The SpawnToPopulationTarget method is responsible for managing the
    automatic spawning of bot characters within a defined game area or zone. It ensures
    that the number of active bots matches the desired population target by creating
    new bot instances as needed. This method typically operates in conjunction with
    bot spawn point configurations and population management systems to maintain consistent
    bot density across different regions of the game world. The method does not directly
    control individual bot behavior but rather manages the overall population count
    and spawning process.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = sBotSpawner->GetSpawnerForZone(1234);

      spawner->SpawnToPopulationTarget();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically by the bot management system to
    maintain population targets. It may perform database operations to track spawned
    bots and could potentially block during high-load scenarios when many bots need
    to be created simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can lead to performance degradation
    due to excessive bot creation operations. Ensure that the underlying spawn point
    configurations are properly set up before invoking this method, as it relies on
    valid spawn locations and target population values.
