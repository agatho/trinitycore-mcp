  method: SignalBurst
  signature: void ArenaAI::SignalBurst(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Signals a burst ability activation for the arena player
  description: The SignalBurst method is used to trigger or notify the AI system that
    a burst ability should be activated for an arena player. This typically occurs
    during arena combat when specific conditions are met, such as reaching a certain
    health threshold or after a cooldown period. The method modifies internal AI state
    to indicate readiness for burst usage and may affect targeting behavior or spell
    selection. It is designed to integrate with the broader ArenaAI framework that
    manages player behavior in competitive PvP environments.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      within the arena context. This parameter determines which specific player's
      AI state will be modified by the burst signal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Burst Signal Usage
    code: "void MyArenaUnit::HandleCombatEvent()\n{\n    // Signal burst for player\
      \ at index 0\n    arenaAI->SignalBurst(&playerIndex);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Burst Activation
    code: "void ArenaCombatManager::UpdateArenaAI()\n{\n    if (playerHealth < 30\
      \ && burstCooldown <= 0)\n    {\n        SignalBurst(&currentPlayerIndex);\n\
      \        burstCooldown = 10; // Set cooldown\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the ArenaAI system during combat
    updates. The player parameter should point to a valid arena participant index,
    otherwise behavior is undefined. Implementation may involve state transitions
    and internal flag setting for burst readiness.
  warnings: Calling SignalBurst with an invalid player index pointer can lead to memory
    corruption or unexpected AI behavior. Ensure that the player parameter points
    to a valid arena combatant before invocation.
