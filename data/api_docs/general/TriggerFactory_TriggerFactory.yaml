documentation:
  brief: Copies the state of an existing TriggerFactory instance to create a new instance.
  description: The TriggerFactory constructor is used to create a new TriggerFactory
    object by copying the state from an existing TriggerFactory object. This is a
    copy constructor that initializes the new instance with data from the provided
    source instance. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and trigger systems, this
    method allows for duplication of trigger configurations or states, which may be
    necessary when creating multiple similar triggers or when managing trigger instances
    in dynamic environments. The copied instance will have identical internal state
    to the source, including any registered callbacks, trigger conditions, or associated
    data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source TriggerFactory object whose state will be copied to initialize
      this new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Copy Construction
    code: 'TriggerFactory originalTrigger;

      // Configure originalTrigger...

      TriggerFactory newTrigger(originalTrigger); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Duplicate Trigger Configuration
    code: 'TriggerFactory baseTrigger;

      // Setup base trigger with conditions and actions

      TriggerFactory duplicateTrigger(baseTrigger);

      // duplicateTrigger now has identical configuration to baseTrigger'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy of the TriggerFactory's internal
    state. If the class contains pointers or dynamically allocated resources, care
    must be taken to ensure proper deep copying behavior if required. The implementation
    should handle any necessary resource management during the copy operation.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this copy constructor with trigger factories that
    contain complex state or external references. Ensure that copying doesn't inadvertently
    share mutable state between instances which could lead to unexpected behavior
    in trigger execution.
