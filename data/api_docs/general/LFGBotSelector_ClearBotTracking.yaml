  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: ClearBotTracking
  signature: void LFGBotSelector::ClearBotTracking(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Clears tracking data for a specified bot GUID from the LFG bot selector.
  description: The ClearBotTracking method removes all tracking information associated
    with a given bot GUID within the LFGBotSelector class. This function is typically
    used to clean up or reset the state of a specific bot when it is no longer needed
    in the LFG (Looking for Group) system. The method ensures that any internal data
    structures maintaining bot tracking status are properly cleared, preventing stale
    or invalid references from persisting. It's an essential part of managing bot
    lifecycle within TrinityCore's LFG framework.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose tracking data needs
      to be cleared. This should be a valid GUID that was previously registered with
      the LFGBotSelector.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear Tracking for a Specific Bot
    code: 'LFGBotSelector selector;

      ObjectGuid botGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      selector.ClearBotTracking(botGuid.GetCounter());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided botGuid is valid and has been previously
    tracked by the selector. The implementation likely involves removing entries from
    internal maps or lists that store bot tracking information. It's recommended to
    ensure that no active operations are using the bot before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a bot GUID that was never registered may lead to
    undefined behavior. Ensure proper synchronization if this method is called from
    multiple threads.
