  class: VMapManager2
  method: GetLiquidFlagsDummy
  signature: uint32 VMapManager2::GetLiquidFlagsDummy(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Returns dummy liquid flags used for VMap collision detection.
  description: The GetLiquidFlagsDummy method retrieves a set of dummy liquid flags
    that are used internally by the VMapManager2 system for collision detection and
    navigation purposes. These flags represent predefined liquid types that are not
    tied to actual game data but serve as placeholders or fallback values during map
    loading and collision checking operations. The method is typically invoked when
    processing map tiles that do not contain valid liquid data, ensuring consistent
    behavior across different map environments. This functionality is crucial for
    maintaining proper collision detection in areas where liquids might be missing
    or undefined.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the dummy liquid flags used for VMap collision
    detection. The specific bit values correspond to predefined liquid types and their
    properties such as depth, type, and navigability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 dummyFlags = VMapManager2::GetLiquidFlagsDummy(0);\n// Use dummyFlags\
      \ for collision detection logic\nif (dummyFlags & LIQUID_TYPE_WATER)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle water liquid type\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the VMapManager2's internal infrastructure and should
    not be called directly by game logic. The returned flags are typically used in
    conjunction with other VMap functions to ensure proper collision detection behavior.
    The dummy flags may vary depending on the specific TrinityCore version and build
    configuration.
  warnings: Do not use this method for actual liquid data retrieval or gameplay logic.
    It is intended purely for internal VMap system operations and should only be called
    by the VMapManager2 class itself or related subsystems.
