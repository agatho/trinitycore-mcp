  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: InstanceCoordination
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::InstanceCoordination()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the InstanceCoordination class for managing
    instance-related coordination tasks.
  description: The InstanceCoordination constructor initializes the internal state
    and data structures required for handling instance coordination within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes setting up necessary member variables, establishing connections
    to relevant subsystems, and preparing the object for use in managing player instance
    entries, group synchronization, and other instance-related operations. The method
    ensures that all required resources are allocated and configured properly before
    the object can be used for its intended purpose of coordinating instance activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InstanceCoordination object
    code: 'InstanceCoordination* coordination = new InstanceCoordination();

      // The object is now ready to be used for instance coordination tasks'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore system
    when creating instance coordination objects. Developers should not directly instantiate
    this class unless specifically required by custom module development. The initialization
    process may involve loading configuration data and setting up internal tracking
    structures.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of InstanceCoordination objects should be avoided
    in standard gameplay code as it's designed to be managed by the core system. Improper
    use can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks.
