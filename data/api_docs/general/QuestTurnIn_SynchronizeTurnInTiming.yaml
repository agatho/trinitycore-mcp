  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: SynchronizeTurnInTiming
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::SynchronizeTurnInTiming(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes quest turn-in timing for all group members when a quest is completed.
  description: The SynchronizeTurnInTiming method ensures that all players in a specified
    group receive consistent quest completion timing and rewards. This is particularly
    important in group quests where multiple players may turn in the same quest simultaneously.
    The method handles synchronization of quest state updates, reward distribution,
    and potential quest completion events across all group members to prevent desynchronization
    issues. It typically gets invoked when a group member successfully turns in a
    quest that affects the entire group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will synchronize
      their quest turn-in timing. Must be a valid group instance, or the method may
      cause undefined behavior.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in. This must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database, otherwise the synchronization will not
      apply correctly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Turn-In Synchronization
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestTurnIn::SynchronizeTurnInTiming(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Synchronizing Turn-In After Quest Completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->GetMembersCount() > 1)\n  \
      \  {\n        QuestTurnIn::SynchronizeTurnInTiming(group, questId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core quest system when
    a group quest is completed. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing
    custom group quest logic. The method assumes that all players in the group are
    within the same instance or zone where the quest can be properly synchronized.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or non-existent quest
    ID may lead to crashes or inconsistent quest states. Always verify that the group
    exists and contains valid members before calling this function.
