    isPositive)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a player's reputation with respect to their social connections.
  description: The UpdateReputation method modifies a player's reputation value within
    the SocialManager system. It adjusts the reputation of a specified player based
    on a change amount and whether that change is positive or negative. This functionality
    is typically used in response to player actions such as completing quests, killing
    mobs, or engaging in PvP activities that affect their standing with various factions
    or other players. The method ensures that reputation changes are properly propagated
    through the social system and may trigger related events or updates in the game
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose reputation is being
      updated. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game world.
  - name: change
    description: The amount by which the player's reputation should be modified. Positive
      values increase reputation, while negative values decrease it.
  - name: isPositive
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the reputation change is positive
      (true) or negative (false). This affects how the change is applied and may influence
      related game mechanics such as faction progression or social interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase Player Reputation
    code: SocialManager::UpdateReputation(12345, 100, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrease Player Reputation
    code: SocialManager::UpdateReputation(12345, -50, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that track player
    relationships and faction standings. It may also trigger callbacks or events related
    to reputation changes, such as updating the player's social list or notifying
    other subsystems of the change.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid corresponds to an existing player in the game
    world; otherwise, the method may fail silently or cause undefined behavior. Be
    cautious with large reputation changes that could result in extreme standings
    (e.g., maxed out or completely negative).
