  class: Map
  method: GetFullTerrainStatusForPosition
  signature: void Map::GetFullTerrainStatusForPosition(const PhaseShift & phaseShift,
    float x, float y, float z, int & data, int reqLiquidType, float collisionHeight)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves terrain status information for a specific position within the map.
  description: This method retrieves detailed terrain information including height,
    liquid type, and collision data for a given position in the world. It is used
    primarily for determining whether a position is valid for movement or placement
    of game objects. The method takes into account phase shifts which affect visibility
    and interaction with different phases of the game world. It provides essential
    data for collision detection and terrain analysis during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: phaseShift
    description: The phase shift that affects how the terrain is interpreted, determining
      which parts of the map are visible or accessible based on current phase status.
  - name: x
    description: X coordinate of the position in world coordinates.
  - name: y
    description: Y coordinate of the position in world coordinates.
  - name: z
    description: Z coordinate of the position in world coordinates.
  - name: data
    description: Reference to an integer that will store terrain data including height,
      liquid type, and collision information. This parameter is modified by the method.
  - name: reqLiquidType
    description: The required liquid type for which the terrain status should be checked.
      -1 indicates any liquid type, while positive values indicate specific liquid
      types.
  - name: collisionHeight
    description: The collision height value that determines how high the terrain is
      at the given position. This parameter is used to determine whether a position
      is suitable for movement or placement of objects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'PhaseShift phaseShift;

      float x = 100.0f, y = 200.0f, z = 50.0f;

      int data = 0;

      int reqLiquidType = -1;

      float collisionHeight = 0.0f;

      map->GetFullTerrainStatusForPosition(phaseShift, x, y, z, data, reqLiquidType,
      collisionHeight);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with phase shift handling
    code: "PhaseShift phaseShift;\nphaseShift.AddPhase(1);\nfloat x = 100.0f, y =\
      \ 200.0f, z = 50.0f;\nint data = 0;\nint reqLiquidType = 3;\nfloat collisionHeight\
      \ = 0.0f;\nmap->GetFullTerrainStatusForPosition(phaseShift, x, y, z, data, reqLiquidType,\
      \ collisionHeight);\nif (data != 0) {\n    // Process terrain data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for collision detection and terrain analysis
    in World of Warcraft. It's important to note that the method modifies the 'data'
    parameter, which means it should be initialized before calling this method. Performance
    considerations include checking multiple positions during pathfinding or movement
    calculations.
  warnings: The method requires proper phase shift handling to ensure accurate terrain
    data. Improper phase shifts can lead to incorrect terrain status information and
    potentially invalid movement or placement of game objects. The 'data' parameter
    must be initialized before calling this method.
