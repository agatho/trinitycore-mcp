  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsDirectPathPossible
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsDirectPathPossible(const int & start, const
    int & goal, const PathRequest & request)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a direct path exists between two points in the game world
    for navigation purposes.
  description: The IsDirectPathPossible method evaluates if there is a clear, unobstructed
    line-of-sight path from a starting point to a goal point within the game's navigation
    mesh. This function is typically used by AI systems and movement logic to quickly
    assess whether an entity can move directly toward a target without needing complex
    pathfinding calculations. It performs a fast raycast or line-of-sight check against
    the world geometry, including obstacles such as walls, terrain features, and other
    solid objects. The method returns true if no collisions are detected along the
    straight-line path between start and goal, and false otherwise. This check is
    often performed before initiating more expensive pathfinding algorithms to optimize
    performance.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position coordinate for the path check. Typically represents
      a point in the game world's coordinate system.
  - name: goal
    description: The destination position coordinate for the path check. Must be a
      valid point within the same coordinate space as the start parameter.
  - name: request
    description: A PathRequest object containing additional parameters and context
      for the pathfinding operation, such as movement flags, collision types, or entity-specific
      constraints.
  returns: Returns true if a direct line-of-sight path exists from start to goal without
    any collisions; otherwise returns false. This indicates that navigation can proceed
    directly without requiring complex pathfinding.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for checking direct path
    code: "PathRequest request;\nrequest.movementFlags = MOVEFLAG_WALKING;\n\nif (pathfinder.IsDirectPathPossible(startPos,\
      \ goalPos, request)) {\n    // Direct path is possible, proceed with simple\
      \ movement\n    player->MoveTo(goalPos);\n} else {\n    // No direct path; use\
      \ full pathfinding\n    pathfinder.CalculatePath(startPos, goalPos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for speed and does not account for dynamic obstacles
    or entities that may block the path during runtime. It relies on static navigation
    mesh data and should be used in conjunction with full pathfinding when precise
    movement is required. The implementation likely uses spatial queries or raycasting
    against the game's collision system.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive result from IsDirectPathPossible guarantees
    successful movement, especially if the goal position changes dynamically. Always
    validate the final path after using this method to ensure correctness in dynamic
    environments.
