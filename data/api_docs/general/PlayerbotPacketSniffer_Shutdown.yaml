documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up the packet sniffer functionality for player bots
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all active packet sniffing operations
    within the PlayerbotPacketSniffer class. It ensures proper cleanup of resources,
    stops any ongoing monitoring processes, and resets internal state to prevent memory
    leaks or undefined behavior. This method is typically called during server shutdown
    or when disabling bot functionality to ensure clean termination of packet interception
    activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotPacketSniffer* sniffer = PlayerbotPacketSniffer::GetInstance();

      sniffer->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no active packet sniffing operations
    are in progress to avoid race conditions. The shutdown process may take a moment
    to complete as it needs to properly terminate all monitoring threads and clean
    up allocated memory.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while packets are actively being processed may result
    in incomplete data handling or corrupted state. Ensure all bot operations are
    suspended before invoking this method.
