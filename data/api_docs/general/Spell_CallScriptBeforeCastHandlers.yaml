documentation:
  brief: Invokes all script handlers before a spell is cast, allowing custom logic
    to be executed prior to spell execution.
  description: The CallScriptBeforeCastHandlers method is responsible for executing
    any registered script handlers that are designed to run before a spell is cast.
    This mechanism allows developers and scripters to inject custom behavior or validation
    logic into the spell casting process. The method typically iterates through all
    available script callbacks associated with the spell and executes them in a predetermined
    order. It's commonly used in custom spell implementations, addons, or modifications
    where additional checks or effects need to occur before the core spell mechanics
    are triggered. This method does not alter the spell's fundamental behavior but
    provides an extension point for modifiable gameplay logic.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Script
    code: "void MySpellScript::OnBeforeCast()\n{\n    // Custom logic before spell\
      \ cast\n    if (GetCaster()->HasAura(SPELL_ID_STUNNED))\n        return;\n \
      \   \n    // Call base handler\n    Spell::CallScriptBeforeCastHandlers();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core spell system during
    the spell preparation phase. It's important to note that script handlers executed
    by this method may modify spell properties or even cancel the spell execution
    if certain conditions are met. The order of execution for multiple script handlers
    is determined by the internal registration mechanism and should not be relied
    upon for critical logic ordering.
  warnings: Improper implementation of script handlers can lead to unexpected behavior
    or crashes. Handlers should avoid modifying spell data structures directly without
    proper locking mechanisms. Additionally, calling this method from within a script
    handler may cause infinite recursion if not handled carefully.
