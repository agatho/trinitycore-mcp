  signature: void Player::UpdateArmorPenetration(int32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's armor penetration value by the specified amount
  description: The UpdateArmorPenetration method modifies a player's armor penetration
    stat, which reduces the effectiveness of enemy armor when dealing damage. This
    method is typically used to apply buffs, debuffs, or equipment changes that affect
    how much armor penetration a player has. The change is applied directly to the
    player's current armor penetration value, and may trigger updates to combat calculations
    and damage outputs. This method does not validate the input amount, so negative
    values will decrease the armor penetration while positive values will increase
    it.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount by which to modify the player's armor penetration value.
      Positive values increase armor penetration, negative values decrease it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase Armor Penetration
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateArmorPenetration(50); // Increases armor penetration by 50'
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrease Armor Penetration
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateArmorPenetration(-25); // Decreases armor penetration by 25'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's armor penetration stat without
    any validation. It should be used carefully to ensure proper game balance and
    prevent exploits. The actual effect on damage calculations depends on how the
    armor penetration is implemented in the combat system.
  warnings: Using large negative values may result in unexpected behavior or exploits
    if not properly bounded. This method does not automatically recalculate combat
    stats; other systems may need to be notified of changes for proper synchronization.
