  class: Unit
  method: SendSetVehicleRecId
  signature: void Unit::SendSetVehicleRecId(uint32 vehicleId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the vehicle ID for the unit and sends it to the client.
  description: This method sets the vehicle ID for a Unit object and sends the vehicle
    record ID to the client. It is used primarily in the context of vehicle mechanics
    where a unit may be mounted on a vehicle, or when a player is entering or exiting
    a vehicle. The method ensures that the client receives proper information about
    the vehicle being used by the unit. This is typically used during vehicle-related
    events such as mounting or dismounting from vehicles.
  parameters:
  - name: vehicleId
    description: The unique identifier for the vehicle record to be set. This ID corresponds
      to a specific vehicle entry in the database, typically referencing a vehicle
      template or entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SendSetVehicleRecId(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      uint32 vehicleId = 54321;

      unit->SendSetVehicleRecId(vehicleId);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during vehicle-related events such as mounting
    or dismounting. It should be used carefully as it affects the client's perception
    of vehicle mechanics. Performance-wise, this method is lightweight but should
    be used in a context where the unit is properly initialized.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper initialization of the
    unit object. Also, calling this method with invalid vehicle IDs can cause client-side
    errors or unexpected behavior.
