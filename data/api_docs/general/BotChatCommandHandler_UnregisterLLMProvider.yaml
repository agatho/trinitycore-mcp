documentation:
  brief: Unregisters the currently active LLM provider from the bot chat command handler.
  description: The UnregisterLLMProvider method removes the currently registered Large
    Language Model (LLM) provider from the BotChatCommandHandler instance. This action
    effectively disables any chat responses that rely on the previously registered
    LLM, preventing further interactions with the LLM-based AI system for bot-generated
    messages. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations.
    It is typically used when switching between different AI providers or when disabling
    AI functionality for a specific bot instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.UnregisterLLMProvider();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that an LLM provider has been previously registered.
    If no provider is registered, the method may have no effect or could throw an
    exception depending on implementation details. The operation should be thread-safe
    if used in a multi-threaded environment.
  warnings: Calling this method while active chat sessions are ongoing may result
    in unexpected behavior or incomplete responses. Ensure that all pending operations
    are completed before unregistering the provider.
