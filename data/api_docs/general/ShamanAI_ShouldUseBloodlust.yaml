  method: ShouldUseBloodlust
  signature: bool ShamanAI::ShouldUseBloodlust() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the shaman AI should use the Bloodlust ability based on
    current combat conditions and cooldown status.
  description: The ShouldUseBloodlust method evaluates various factors such as the
    shaman's current mana, available cooldowns, and combat situation to decide if
    using the Bloodlust spell would be beneficial. This method is typically used within
    the ShamanAI class to make intelligent decisions about when to activate this powerful
    buff that increases attack speed and movement speed for the entire party or raid.
    The decision-making process considers the timing of the ability usage, ensuring
    it aligns with optimal gameplay strategies and does not interfere with other important
    abilities or cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the shaman AI determines that using Bloodlust at this moment
    is advantageous; otherwise returns false. The decision may depend on factors like
    mana availability, combat duration, and presence of other beneficial effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (shamanAI->ShouldUseBloodlust()) {\n    shamanAI->CastSpell(BLOODLUST_SPELL_ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making logic for shamans in TrinityCore.
    It should be called periodically during combat to evaluate the current state and
    determine optimal ability usage. The implementation likely includes checks for
    mana cost, cooldowns, and strategic timing within the encounter.
