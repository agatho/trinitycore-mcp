  class: InteractionManager
  method: LearnOptimalSpells
  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::LearnOptimalSpells(Player * bot,
    Creature * trainer)
documentation:
  brief: Teaches optimal spells to a bot player from a trainer creature.
  description: The LearnOptimalSpells method evaluates the current state of a bot
    player and determines which spells are most beneficial for their class, level,
    and specialization. It then interacts with a provided trainer creature to learn
    these optimal spells. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems within
    TrinityCore to enhance bot performance by ensuring they have access to the most
    effective abilities for their role. The process involves checking spell availability,
    prerequisites, and player requirements before attempting to learn each spell.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will learn
      spells. Must be a valid player instance with appropriate class and level data.
  - name: trainer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the trainer NPC from
      which spells are learned. Must be a valid trainer creature with spell learning
      capabilities.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the success or failure of
    the spell learning process. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILURE, INVALID_TARGET,
    or INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES depending on the outcome.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LearnOptimalSpells
    code: "InteractionResult result = interactionManager.LearnOptimalSpells(botPlayer,\
      \ trainerCreature);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Spells\
      \ learned successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Bot learned optimal spells\
      \ from trainer\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\"\
      , \"Failed to learn optimal spells: {}\", static_cast<int>(result));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player and trainer creature are properly
    initialized and accessible. It may require the bot to be within interaction range
    of the trainer. The actual spell learning logic is dependent on internal AI decision-making
    processes and spell availability checks.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot and trainer parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method, as passing null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also note that this method may have performance implications
    if called frequently during bot operation.
