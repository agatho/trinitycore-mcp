documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the SpatialGridManager
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the SpatialGridManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the spatial grid manager exists throughout
    the application. This manager is responsible for organizing and managing game
    objects within a spatial grid system, which is crucial for efficient object culling,
    collision detection, and performance optimization in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment. The method guarantees thread-safe access to the singleton instance
    and should be used whenever spatial grid functionality is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single instance of SpatialGridManager. This reference
    can be used directly to access all methods and properties of the spatial grid
    manager without requiring additional instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpatialGridManager& gridManager = SpatialGridManager::Instance();

      // Use gridManager to access spatial grid functionality

      gridManager.Update();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Grid Functions
    code: 'SpatialGridManager& manager = SpatialGridManager::Instance();

      manager.AddGameObject(gameObject);

      manager.RemoveGameObject(gameObject);

      // Perform spatial queries using the singleton instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the Meyers' singleton pattern with static local variable
    for thread safety. The instance is created on first access and destroyed at program
    termination. Developers should not attempt to manually instantiate SpatialGridManager
    objects as it's designed as a singleton.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within a constructor of another singleton
    class, as it may lead to undefined behavior due to initialization order fiasco.
    The returned reference is valid for the entire application lifetime.
