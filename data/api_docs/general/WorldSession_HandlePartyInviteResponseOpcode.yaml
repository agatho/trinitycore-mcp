documentation:
  brief: Processes a party invite response from a player, handling acceptance or decline
    of group invitations.
  description: The HandlePartyInviteResponseOpcode method is responsible for processing
    incoming party invite responses from players in the World of Warcraft game. When
    a player accepts or declines a party invitation sent by another player, this method
    is invoked to handle the response. It evaluates whether the invited player has
    accepted or rejected the invitation and updates the party state accordingly. The
    method interacts with the party system to either add the player to an existing
    group or notify the inviter that the invitation was declined. This method is part
    of the core WorldSession handling for group mechanics and ensures proper synchronization
    of party states between players.

  examples:
  - title: Basic party invite response handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandlePartyInviteResponseOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::PartyInviteResponse&\
      \ packet) {\n    if (packet.Accepted)\n        // Process acceptance logic\n\
      \    else\n        // Process decline logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main packet processing loop when
    a PARTY_INVITE_RESPONSE opcode is received. The method assumes that the session
    has an active player and that the party invitation was valid. It performs no direct
    network communication but modifies internal party state which may trigger subsequent
    network updates to other group members.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by other systems without proper
    validation of the packet data. Improper handling of party invitations can lead
    to inconsistent party states or player disconnections. The method does not validate
    that the inviting player is still online before processing the response.
