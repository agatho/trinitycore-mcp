documentation:
  brief: Heals the hunter's pet using available health potions or abilities.
  description: The HealPet method is responsible for restoring health to the hunter's
    summoned pet. This method typically checks if the pet is below a certain health
    threshold and then attempts to heal it using appropriate in-game resources such
    as health potions, healing abilities, or other support mechanics. It is part of
    the HunterAI class which governs the behavior of hunter pets in the game environment.
    The method does not require any parameters and performs its actions internally
    based on the current state of the pet and available resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      \    if (me->GetPet() && me->GetPet()->GetHealth() < me->GetPet()->GetMaxHealth()\
      \ * 0.5f)\n        HealPet();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the HunterAI's update loop or in response
    to specific conditions such as low pet health. It assumes that the hunter has
    a valid pet and appropriate healing resources available. The actual healing mechanism
    may vary depending on the hunter's class specialization and available abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that the pet exists and is valid before calling this method to
    prevent potential null pointer exceptions. The method should only be called when
    the hunter AI is actively managing the pet, otherwise it may interfere with other
    AI behaviors.
