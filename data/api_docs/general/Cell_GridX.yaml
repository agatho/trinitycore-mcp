documentation:
  brief: Returns the X coordinate of the grid cell within the world map.
  description: The GridX method retrieves the horizontal grid coordinate of a Cell
    object, which represents a specific area in the game world. In TrinityCore's spatial
    partitioning system, the world is divided into grid cells for efficient object
    management and visibility calculations. This method provides access to the X component
    of that grid cell's position, allowing developers to determine where a particular
    cell is located horizontally within the overall world grid structure. The returned
    value corresponds to the grid column index, with lower values representing positions
    further west on the map.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the X coordinate of the grid cell. This value
    indicates the horizontal position of the cell within the world's grid system,
    where positive values typically correspond to eastern directions and negative
    values to western directions.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Grid X Coordinate
    code: 'Cell cell(10, 15);

      int xCoord = cell.GridX();

      // xCoord will be 10

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in Grid-Based Logic
    code: "for (int x = 0; x < MAX_GRID_X; ++x)\n{\n    for (int y = 0; y < MAX_GRID_Y;\
      \ ++y)\n    {\n        Cell cell(x, y);\n        if (cell.GridX() == player.GetGridX())\n\
      \        {\n            // Process cells in the same X grid column\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal grid management system used
    for efficient object culling and visibility determination. The returned coordinate
    is based on the world's grid system, which may differ from the actual world coordinates
    of objects within the cell. The method is const and thread-safe as it only reads
    immutable data members.
  warnings: Be aware that grid coordinates are not the same as world coordinates -
    they represent discrete grid positions rather than precise locations. When comparing
    grid coordinates, ensure you're working with the correct coordinate system for
    your use case to avoid logical errors in spatial calculations.
