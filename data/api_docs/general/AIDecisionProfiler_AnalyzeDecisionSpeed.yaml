  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: AnalyzeDecisionSpeed
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::AnalyzeDecisionSpeed(uint32_t botGuid, BotAIDecisionProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and records the decision-making speed of a bot AI for performance
    profiling.
  description: The AnalyzeDecisionSpeed method evaluates the time taken by a bot AI
    to make a decision based on the provided profile data. It is used within the TrinityCore
    framework to monitor and optimize AI behavior in World of Warcraft bot systems.
    This method likely updates internal timing statistics or logs decision duration
    metrics for further analysis. The method operates on a specific bot identified
    by its GUID and modifies the provided BotAIDecisionProfile object to reflect performance
    data. It is typically invoked during AI decision cycles to gather profiling information
    without altering core gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose decision-making speed
      is being analyzed. Must be a valid bot GUID within the current session.
  - name: profile
    description: A reference to a BotAIDecisionProfile object containing AI decision
      data and performance metrics. The method modifies this object to store timing
      information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotAIDecisionProfile profile;

      profiler.AnalyzeDecisionSpeed(botGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Profiling Integration
    code: "void OnBotDecisionMade(uint32_t botGuid) {\n    BotAIDecisionProfile profile;\n\
      \    // ... populate profile with decision data ...\n    profiler.AnalyzeDecisionSpeed(botGuid,\
      \ profile);\n    // ... log or analyze profile results ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AIDecisionProfiler class and likely used in conjunction
    with other profiling tools to monitor AI performance. It may be called frequently
    during bot operation, so performance considerations should be taken into account
    when implementing or extending this functionality.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid is valid and corresponds to an active
    bot within the system. Passing invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The profile object must be properly initialized before calling this
    method.
