documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script identifier associated with a specific achievement ID.
  description: The GetAchievementScriptId method is used to obtain the unique script
    identifier (ScriptId) that corresponds to a given achievement ID within the TrinityCore
    framework. This functionality is essential for linking achievements to their respective
    scripted behaviors or triggers in the game world. The method performs a lookup
    in the global achievement manager's internal data structures to find and return
    the associated script ID. It is commonly used during achievement evaluation, reward
    processing, or when determining how an achievement should behave based on its
    defined script. This method does not modify any state and is purely a lookup operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the script identifier (ScriptId) associated
    with the specified achievement ID. If no matching script is found for the given
    achievement ID, the method may return 0 or another default value indicating an
    invalid or unassigned script ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 achievementId = 12345;\nuint32 scriptId = AchievementGlobalMgr::GetAchievementScriptId(achievementId);\n\
      if (scriptId != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with script-based logic\n    printf(\"\
      Achievement %u is linked to script %u\\n\", achievementId, scriptId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AchievementGlobalMgr singleton has been properly
    initialized and populated with valid achievement data. The internal lookup mechanism
    may rely on cached or pre-loaded data structures, so calling this method before
    all achievements are loaded might return unexpected results. Performance is generally
    O(1) for well-indexed lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the achievementId parameter passed to this method is valid
    and corresponds to an existing achievement in the database; otherwise, it may
    return an invalid script ID or cause undefined behavior depending on implementation
    details. This method should not be called during critical sections where data
    consistency is paramount unless thread safety is guaranteed.
