  brief: Calculates the slope of a linear regression line from a set of float values
  description: The CalculateSlope method computes the slope of the best-fit line through
    a series of data points using linear regression. This is commonly used in analytics
    to determine trends in player behavior, performance metrics, or game economy data.
    The method takes a vector of floating-point values representing data points and
    returns the calculated slope as a float. It assumes that the data points are equally
    spaced along the x-axis, making it suitable for time-series analysis where each
    value represents a measurement at sequential intervals.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the slope of the linear regression line
    fitted to the input data points. A positive slope indicates an increasing trend,
    a negative slope indicates a decreasing trend, and a slope near zero suggests
    little to no linear relationship in the data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Trend Analysis
    code: 'std::vector<float> playerScores = {10.5f, 12.3f, 14.1f, 16.7f, 18.2f};

      float trendSlope = learningAnalytics.CalculateSlope(playerScores);

      // Result: Positive slope indicating increasing scores over time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Slope to Detect Performance Changes
    code: "std::vector<float> fpsValues = {60.0f, 58.2f, 55.7f, 53.1f, 50.9f};\nfloat\
      \ fpsTrend = learningAnalytics.CalculateSlope(fpsValues);\nif (fpsTrend < -1.0f)\
      \ {\n    // Alert: Significant FPS degradation detected\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements a simple linear regression calculation without intercept
    term, assuming x-values are sequential integers starting from 0. The algorithm
    uses the least squares method for slope calculation. For optimal performance with
    large datasets, consider pre-processing data to avoid repeated calculations.
  warnings: The method does not validate input data for empty vectors or NaN values.
    If passed an empty vector, behavior is undefined and may result in division by
    zero or other unexpected results. Ensure input data contains valid floating-point
    numbers before calling this method.
