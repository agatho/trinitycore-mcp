  method: CheckScheduledResetTimes
  signature: void World::CheckScheduledResetTimes()
documentation:
  brief: Checks and processes scheduled reset times for game content such as daily
    quests, instance resets, and other time-based events.
  description: The CheckScheduledResetTimes method is responsible for evaluating and
    executing scheduled reset operations within the World object. This includes handling
    daily quest resets, instance lockouts, and other time-sensitive game mechanics
    that require periodic reset behavior. The method iterates through all active reset
    schedules and triggers appropriate actions when reset times are reached. It ensures
    that players' progress and access to content are properly managed according to
    game rules and timing constraints. This method is typically called at regular
    intervals by the game loop to maintain synchronization of time-based events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sWorld->CheckScheduledResetTimes();\n\
      \    // ... continue game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the World object's main
    update cycle. It performs time-based checks without blocking the main thread,
    though it may trigger database operations that could impact performance during
    high-traffic periods. The method handles multiple reset types including daily
    quests, weekly rewards, and instance resets.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of the normal game loop may cause
    unexpected behavior or duplicate reset events. It should only be called from within
    the core World update mechanism to maintain proper synchronization of game state.
