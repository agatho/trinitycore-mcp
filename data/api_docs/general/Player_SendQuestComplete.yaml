  signature: void Player::SendQuestComplete(uint32 questId) const
documentation:
  brief: SendQuestComplete sends a quest completion message to the player's client,
    notifying them that a quest has been completed.
  description: The SendQuestComplete method is used to notify the player's client
    that a specific quest has been completed. This method sends a packet to the player's
    client which updates their quest log and removes the quest from their active quest
    list. It is typically used when a quest is completed through quest completion,
    such as when a player finishes a quest by turning in required items or completing
    objectives. The method ensures that the player receives proper feedback about
    the quest status and allows them to proceed with quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being completed. This value corresponds
      to the quest ID in the database, typically found in the quest_template table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->SendQuestComplete(12345);

      // This sends a quest completion notification for quest ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's quest system and should be called
    when a quest is completed. It does not directly update the database or player's
    quest log, but rather sends a message to the client to inform them that the quest
    has been completed. The method may trigger additional logic in the client-side
    quest handling if the quest is part of a larger quest chain.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest status updates
    on the player's client, potentially causing confusion or missing quest completion
    notifications. It should only be called when the quest has actually been completed
    by the player.
