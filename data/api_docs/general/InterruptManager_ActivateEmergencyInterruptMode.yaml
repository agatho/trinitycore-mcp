  signature: void InterruptManager::ActivateEmergencyInterruptMode()
documentation:
  brief: Activates emergency interrupt mode for the InterruptManager, enabling immediate
    interruption of ongoing actions.
  description: The ActivateEmergencyInterruptMode method is used to enable a special
    interrupt state within the InterruptManager class. This mode typically allows
    for immediate interruption of ongoing actions or spells, bypassing normal interrupt
    cooldowns and restrictions. It's commonly used in scenarios where an urgent interruption
    is required, such as during critical combat situations or when handling emergency
    events in the game world. The method does not take any parameters and has no return
    value. When called, it transitions the InterruptManager into a state where subsequent
    interrupt requests are processed with higher priority.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = player->GetInterruptManager();

      interruptMgr->ActivateEmergencyInterruptMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used sparingly as it bypasses normal interrupt mechanics.
    It may have performance implications if called frequently during high-intensity
    combat scenarios. The emergency mode is typically reset automatically after a
    short duration or upon specific conditions.
  warnings: Using this method excessively can lead to unexpected behavior in spell
    interruption logic. It should only be invoked when absolutely necessary for critical
    game events. Improper usage may cause spells to interrupt unexpectedly or disrupt
    normal gameplay flow.
