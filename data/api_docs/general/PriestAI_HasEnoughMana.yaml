  class: PriestAI
  method: HasEnoughMana
  signature: bool PriestAI::HasEnoughMana(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the priest has sufficient mana to cast a spell with the specified
    mana cost.
  description: The HasEnoughMana method evaluates whether the current priest AI unit
    possesses enough mana to execute a spell requiring a specific amount of mana.
    This method is typically used within the AI's decision-making process to determine
    spell casting viability. It considers the unit's current mana pool and compares
    it against the required mana amount. The method does not modify any state and
    is purely a query operation. This functionality is essential for proper spell
    selection and resource management in priest AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The required mana amount needed to cast the intended spell or ability.
  returns: Returns true if the priest's current mana is greater than or equal to the
    specified amount, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mana Check
    code: "if (priestAI->HasEnoughMana(50)) {\n    // Cast a spell that costs 50 mana\n\
      \    priestAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FLASH_HEAL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Mana Check in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (priestAI->HasEnoughMana(120) && !priestAI->IsCasting()) {\n    // Cast\
      \ Power Word: Shield if enough mana and not already casting\n    priestAI->CastSpell(priestAI->GetVictim(),\
      \ SPELL_POWER_WORD_SHIELD);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI unit's current mana value which is updated by
    the game engine. It does not account for mana regeneration or any temporary mana
    bonuses that might affect casting. The check is immediate and does not consider
    future mana changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'amount' parameter represents a valid mana cost; passing
    negative values may lead to unexpected behavior. This method should not be used
    as the sole determinant for spell casting decisions, as other factors like line
    of sight or target validity should also be considered.
