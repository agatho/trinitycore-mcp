  signature: void EvokerAI::OptimizeResourceUsage()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes resource usage for the evoker AI by managing spell casting efficiency
    and mana allocation.
  description: The OptimizeResourceUsage method is responsible for enhancing the performance
    of an evoker's AI behavior by dynamically adjusting how resources such as mana
    are consumed during spell casting. This method evaluates current combat conditions,
    available resources, and spell priorities to ensure optimal usage of abilities
    without unnecessary waste. It plays a crucial role in maintaining efficient gameplay
    for evoker NPCs or player-controlled evokers within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method does not require any input parameters and modifies internal AI state
    variables related to resource management.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n \
      \   OptimizeResourceUsage();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update cycle to maintain
    consistent resource optimization. It may influence spell selection and timing
    based on current mana levels and combat situation.
