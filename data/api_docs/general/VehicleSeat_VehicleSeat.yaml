    VehicleSeatAddon * seatAddon)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a VehicleSeat object with provided seat entry and addon data.
  description: The VehicleSeat constructor initializes a vehicle seat instance using
    the provided vehicle seat entry information and associated addon data. This method
    sets up internal state variables that define how passengers are seated, oriented,
    and controlled within a vehicle. The seatInfo parameter contains static configuration
    data about the seat's position, orientation, and passenger limits, while seatAddon
    provides additional runtime behavior settings such as animation states or control
    flags. This constructor is typically called during vehicle creation or initialization
    phases when establishing the seating layout for a vehicle.
  parameters:
  - name: seatInfo
    description: Pointer to VehicleSeatEntry structure containing static seat configuration
      data including position, orientation, passenger limits, and seat type information
  - name: seatAddon
    description: Pointer to VehicleSeatAddon structure containing runtime addon data
      such as animation states, control flags, and additional behavior settings for
      the vehicle seat
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Seat Initialization
    code: 'VehicleSeatEntry* entry = sVehicleSeatStore.LookupEntry(12345);

      VehicleSeatAddon* addon = sVehicleSeatAddonStore.LookupEntry(67890);

      VehicleSeat seat(entry, addon);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Vehicle Seat Construction in Vehicle Creation
    code: "void Vehicle::InitializeSeats()\n{\n    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_VEHICLE_SEATS;\
      \ ++i)\n    {\n        if (m_seatEntries[i])\n        {\n            m_seats[i]\
      \ = new VehicleSeat(m_seatEntries[i], m_seatAddons[i]);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation of the input parameters.
    It is assumed that both seatInfo and seatAddon point to valid entries in their
    respective lookup tables. The VehicleSeat object will store pointers to these
    structures rather than copying the data, so the referenced entries must remain
    valid for the lifetime of this VehicleSeat instance.
  warnings: Passing null pointers to this constructor will likely cause crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that both parameters reference valid entries from their
    respective database stores before calling this constructor. The seat addon data
    may be optional in some cases, but passing a null pointer should be avoided unless
    explicitly documented as supported.
