  method: GetSlowDecisionBots
  signature: std::vector<uint32_t> AIDecisionProfiler::GetSlowDecisionBots(uint32_t
    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of bot GUIDs that have exhibited slow decision-making behavior.
  description: The GetSlowDecisionBots method returns a vector containing the unique
    identifiers (GUIDs) of AI-controlled bots that have been identified as having
    slow decision-making performance. This profiling mechanism is typically used for
    debugging or performance optimization purposes within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method does not take any parameters and provides a snapshot of current slow-performing
    bots at the time of invocation. It's part of the AIDecisionProfiler class which
    tracks and analyzes AI behavior in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<uint32_t> containing the GUIDs of bots with slow decision-making
    behavior. Each uint32_t represents a unique identifier for an AI-controlled bot
    in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> slowBots = aiProfiler.GetSlowDecisionBots(5);\nfor\
      \ (uint32_t guid : slowBots) {\n    std::cout << \"Slow bot GUID: \" << guid\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with performance monitoring systems
    to identify AI bottlenecks. The returned vector may be empty if no slow decision
    bots are currently detected. Implementation details suggest this method might
    rely on internal timing measurements or decision processing logs.
  warnings: The returned GUIDs represent active bot instances in the game world, so
    using these identifiers requires proper validation to ensure they correspond to
    valid entities. This method should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    sections as it may involve iterating through AI state tracking structures.
