  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: AnalyzePrice
  signature: PriceAnalysis MarketAnalysis::AnalyzePrice(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns pricing data for a specified item ID from the auction
    house market.
  description: 'The AnalyzePrice method retrieves comprehensive pricing analysis for
    a given item ID by examining current auction house listings, historical sales
    data, and market trends. It aggregates information such as average price, minimum
    price, maximum price, and sale frequency to provide a detailed market overview.
    This method is commonly used by in-game systems or addons that require real-time
    market intelligence for economic decision-making. The analysis considers all active
    auctions for the specified item and may include data from recent completed transactions
    if available. Precondition: The itemId must correspond to a valid item in the
    game database; otherwise, the method may return default or empty results.'
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to analyze. Must be a valid item
      ID present in the game's item database.
  returns: A PriceAnalysis object containing detailed market statistics for the specified
    item, including average price, min/max prices, and sale frequency. Returns an
    empty or default PriceAnalysis structure if no data is available for the given
    itemId.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PriceAnalysis analysis = marketAnalyzer.AnalyzePrice(12345);\nif (analysis.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Average Price: \" << analysis.GetAveragePrice() << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Market Trend Analysis
    code: "uint32 itemId = 18765;\nPriceAnalysis result = marketAnalyzer.AnalyzePrice(itemId);\n\
      if (result.GetSaleFrequency() > 10) {\n    std::cout << \"High activity item\
      \ with average price: \" << result.GetAveragePrice() << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Low activity item\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries and should not be called frequently
    in tight loops due to performance considerations. The returned PriceAnalysis object
    is thread-safe for read operations but should not be modified directly by multiple
    threads.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId may result in undefined behavior
    or return unreliable data. Ensure that the item exists in the game database before
    calling this function. Performance degradation may occur during peak server load
    times when processing large volumes of market data.
