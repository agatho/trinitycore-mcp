  signature: bool ObjectGuid::IsCast() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a cast-related object type.
  description: The IsCast method checks if the ObjectGuid instance corresponds to
    a cast-related object, typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to identify specific types of game objects. This method evaluates the internal
    GUID structure and returns true if the object type is classified as a cast, which
    may include spell effects, projectiles, or other temporary game entities that
    are created during casting operations. The implementation relies on the object
    type field within the GUID structure to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a cast-related object type; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the GUID refers to an object that was created
    as part of a spell casting or similar game mechanic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if GUID is cast type
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Spell>(12345);\nif (guid.IsCast())\
      \ {\n    printf(\"This GUID represents a cast object\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      This GUID does not represent a cast object\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs a bitwise check on the high GUID bits to determine object
    type. It's important to note that this functionality may be subject to changes
    in future TrinityCore versions as object type definitions evolve. The performance
    impact is minimal as it only involves checking internal bit patterns.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole validation for spell casting
    operations, as additional context checks might be required. Be aware that GUID
    types can vary between different game realms or patches, so this check may need
    to be updated accordingly.
