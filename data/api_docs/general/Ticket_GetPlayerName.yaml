documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the player associated with the ticket
  description: The GetPlayerName method returns the GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
    of the player who submitted the support ticket. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore to uniquely identify players across the game world and is essential
    for linking ticket data to specific user accounts. The method does not perform
    any validation or lookup operations; it simply returns the stored GUID value from
    the ticket's internal data structure. This function is typically used in ticket
    management systems to associate tickets with player accounts for tracking, response
    handling, and administrative purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the GUID of the player who created
    the ticket. This is a unique numerical identifier that corresponds to the player's
    entry in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve player GUID
    code: "Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif (ticket)\n\
      {\n    uint32 playerGuid = ticket->GetPlayerName();\n    // Use playerGuid for\
      \ further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ticket has been properly initialized with a
    valid player GUID. The return value is typically used in conjunction with other
    database lookups to retrieve detailed player information. Performance-wise, this
    is a simple getter operation with O(1) complexity.
  warnings: Ensure that the ticket object is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as it will likely crash or return undefined behavior if called on an uninitialized
    or destroyed ticket instance.
