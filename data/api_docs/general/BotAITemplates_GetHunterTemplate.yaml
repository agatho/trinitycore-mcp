  method: GetHunterTemplate
  signature: BotAIConfig BotAITemplates::GetHunterTemplate()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the default AI configuration template for hunter bots.
  description: The GetHunterTemplate method returns a BotAIConfig object that defines
    the default behavior and settings for hunter-type bot characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This template includes various AI parameters such as spell priorities,
    movement patterns, target selection criteria, and combat strategies specific to
    hunter classes. The returned configuration is typically used as a baseline when
    initializing new hunter bots or resetting their AI behavior to default settings.
    This method does not modify any existing bot states; it simply provides a pre-defined
    configuration that can be customized further if needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotAIConfig object containing the default AI settings for hunter bots,
    including spell usage priorities, combat behaviors, and movement strategies specific
    to the hunter class.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Apply Hunter Template
    code: 'BotAIConfig hunterTemplate = botAiTemplates.GetHunterTemplate();

      // Modify template as needed

      hunterTemplate.SetSpellPriority("Arcane Shot", 1);

      // Apply to a specific bot

      bot->SetAIConfig(hunterTemplate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during bot initialization or when resetting
    AI behavior. The returned BotAIConfig object should be treated as immutable for
    direct modification; instead, create a copy and modify that copy before applying
    it to bots.
  warnings: Do not directly modify the returned BotAIConfig object as it may be shared
    across multiple bots. Always make a copy if modifications are required to avoid
    unintended side effects in other bot instances.
