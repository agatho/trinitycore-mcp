documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is in DND mode
  description: This method checks if the player is currently in Do Not Disturb (DND)
    mode, which is a state where the player's character is marked as being busy or
    away from keyboard. When a player is in DND mode, they will not receive any whispers
    or messages from other players, and their status will be displayed as 'Away' to
    other players. This method is commonly used for checking player availability and
    managing communication settings in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is in DND mode, false otherwise. The method
    returns a boolean value that indicates whether the player's DND status is active
    or not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->isDND()) {\n    // Player is in DND mode\n    // Do something\
      \ specific to DND state\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player status checking
    methods. It's important to note that DND mode is different from AFK (Away From
    Keyboard) mode, though both can be active at the same time. The method may not
    always return accurate results if the player has not been properly set to DND
    mode by the game system.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not directly affect the player's communication
    settings or behavior in the game world. It only indicates whether the player is
    marked as being in DND mode, which may not be the same as being truly unavailable
    for communication.
