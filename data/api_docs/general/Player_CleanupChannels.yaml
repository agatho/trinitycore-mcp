  brief: Cleans up all active channel spells for the player
  description: The CleanupChannels method removes all active channel spells from the
    player's spell list, effectively ending any ongoing channeling effects. This method
    is typically called during player logout, character transfer, or when a player's
    channeling needs to be forcibly terminated. It ensures that no channel spells
    remain in the player's active spell list, preventing potential issues with spell
    tracking and gameplay mechanics.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void Player::CleanupChannels()\n{\n    // Remove all channel spells from\
      \ player's spell list\n    // This is called internally during logout process\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal cleanup process and should not be called
    directly in most cases. It typically gets invoked automatically during player
    logout or when a player's channeling needs to be terminated.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell tracking, potentially
    causing issues with gameplay mechanics and spell effects.
