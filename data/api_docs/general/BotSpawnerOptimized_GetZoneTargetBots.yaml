  signature: uint32 BotSpawnerOptimized::GetZoneTargetBots(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of target bots assigned to a specific zone in the optimized
    bot spawner system.
  description: The GetZoneTargetBots method returns the count of target bots that
    are configured to spawn within a specified zone. This method is part of the BotSpawnerOptimized
    class, which manages bot spawning logic for World of Warcraft servers using the
    TrinityCore framework. It allows administrators or internal systems to query how
    many bots are designated for a particular zone, useful for monitoring, balancing,
    or debugging purposes. The method does not modify any state and is read-only in
    nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of target bots assigned to
    the specified zone. Returns zero if no bots are configured for that zone or if
    the zone ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Query Target Bot Count for a Zone
    code: "uint32 botCount = botSpawner->GetZoneTargetBots(1234);\nif (botCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Zone 1234 has \" << botCount << \" target bots.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that zone IDs are valid and correspond to existing zones
    in the game world. It is recommended to validate zone IDs before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior. Performance is optimal as it only reads precomputed
    data structures.
