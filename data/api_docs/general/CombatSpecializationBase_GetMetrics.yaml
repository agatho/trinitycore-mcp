  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const PerformanceMetrics & CombatSpecializationBase::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the performance metrics associated with the combat specialization.
  description: The GetMetrics method retrieves a constant reference to the PerformanceMetrics
    object that contains detailed performance statistics for the combat specialization.
    This includes data such as damage dealt, healing done, resource usage, and other
    relevant metrics that track how effectively the specialization performs in combat
    scenarios. The returned metrics are typically updated during combat events and
    can be used for analysis, reporting, or balancing purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PerformanceMetrics object containing detailed
    performance statistics related to the combat specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Specialization Metrics
    code: 'const PerformanceMetrics& metrics = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->GetMetrics();

      uint32 damageDealt = metrics.GetTotalDamage();

      uint32 healingDone = metrics.GetTotalHealing();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PerformanceMetrics reference is valid only as long as the CombatSpecializationBase
    object exists. Modifications to the metrics should be done through dedicated setter
    methods rather than direct access to avoid breaking internal consistency.
