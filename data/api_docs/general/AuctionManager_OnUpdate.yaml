  class: AuctionManager
  method: OnUpdate
  signature: void AuctionManager::OnUpdate(uint32 elapsed)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction house manager's internal state and processes pending
    auction operations.
  description: The OnUpdate method is responsible for maintaining the auction house
    functionality by processing time-based events and updating auction states. It
    handles tasks such as checking for expired auctions, notifying players of auction
    outcomes, and managing the auction house's internal data structures. This method
    is typically called from the game loop at regular intervals to ensure real-time
    auction house operations. The elapsed parameter indicates the time passed since
    the last update, which is used to determine when auctions should expire or when
    other time-sensitive actions need to be performed.
  parameters:
  - name: elapsed
    description: The number of milliseconds that have passed since the last update
      call. This value is used to calculate time-based auction events and determine
      when auctions should expire.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    auctionMgr->OnUpdate(diff);\n    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with World UpdateManager
    code: "class World : public Updater\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Process world updates\n        auctionMgr->OnUpdate(diff);\n\
      \        // ... other updates ...\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to maintain
    auction house functionality. The elapsed time parameter is crucial for accurate
    auction expiration timing and should represent actual elapsed game time, not wall
    clock time. The implementation may perform database operations for updating auction
    states.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from non-main threads without proper
    synchronization. Improper handling of the elapsed parameter can cause auctions
    to expire at incorrect times or create inconsistencies in auction data.
