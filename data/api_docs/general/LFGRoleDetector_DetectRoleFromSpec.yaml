  method: DetectRoleFromSpec
  signature: uint8 LFGRoleDetector::DetectRoleFromSpec(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the most suitable role for a player based on their specialization
    and class.
  description: The DetectRoleFromSpec method evaluates a player's current specialization
    and class to assign an appropriate role within the Looking For Group (LFG) system.
    This function is used internally by TrinityCore to automatically suggest roles
    such as Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer for players participating in group content.
    It considers the player's active spec and class-specific role mappings to return
    a standardized role identifier. The method does not modify any player state but
    provides a role recommendation that can be used for LFG queue matching and group
    formation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the detected role. Possible values typically
    include 0 (None), 1 (Tank), 2 (Healer), and 3 (Damage). The exact mapping may
    vary based on TrinityCore's internal role definitions and class configurations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Context
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized\nuint8 role = sLFGMgr->DetectRoleFromSpec(player);\n\
      if (role == LFG_ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Handle tank role assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current specialization state and class
    configuration. It assumes that the player has a valid spec assigned, which is
    typically managed by the game client and server synchronization. The returned
    role value should be interpreted according to TrinityCore's LFG role constants
    (e.g., LFG_ROLE_TANK, LFG_ROLE_HEALER, LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE).
  warnings: This method may return LFG_ROLE_NONE if a player's spec does not map to
    a recognized role. Ensure that your code handles this case appropriately when
    using the returned value for group matching or UI display.
