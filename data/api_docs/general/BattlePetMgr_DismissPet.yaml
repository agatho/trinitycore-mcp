documentation:
  brief: Removes the currently active battle pet from the player's collection and
    returns it to the player's inventory.
  description: The DismissPet method is responsible for removing the currently active
    battle pet from the player's control. When called, this function will dismiss
    the active battle pet, returning it to the player's collection where it can be
    used again in future battles or traded. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no validation on whether a pet is actually active before attempting
    dismissal. This action effectively ends the current battle pet's active state
    and allows the player to manage their pet collection as needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Dismiss Active Battle Pet
    code: "BattlePetMgr* petMgr = player->GetBattlePetMgr();\nif (petMgr)\n{\n   \
      \ petMgr->DismissPet();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player wishes to end their current
    battle pet's active state. It should be used carefully as it may affect ongoing
    battle scenarios or pet management. The method assumes that there is an active
    pet in the manager's control.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if a pet is actually active may result
    in unexpected behavior. Ensure proper validation before calling to avoid potential
    errors or inconsistencies in pet management.
