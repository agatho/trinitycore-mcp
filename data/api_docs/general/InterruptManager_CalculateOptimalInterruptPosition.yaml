  class: InterruptManager
  method: CalculateOptimalInterruptPosition
  signature: int InterruptManager::CalculateOptimalInterruptPosition(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal interrupt position for a target unit based on combat
    mechanics and spell casting behavior.
  description: The CalculateOptimalInterruptPosition method determines the best location
    to interrupt an enemy's spell cast by evaluating various factors such as target
    movement, spell casting time, and positional advantages. This method is typically
    used in AI decision-making processes to determine when and where a unit should
    attempt to interrupt another unit's spellcasting. The calculation considers the
    target's current state, including whether it is casting a spell, moving, or otherwise
    engaged in combat actions. It returns an integer value representing a calculated
    position or priority level that indicates how optimal the interrupt scenario is
    for the caster.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal interrupt
    position. A higher value typically indicates a better opportunity to interrupt,
    while a lower or negative value may indicate poor timing or impossibility of interruption.
    The exact meaning of the returned values depends on internal implementation logic
    and game mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "int optimalPosition = interruptManager.CalculateOptimalInterruptPosition(targetUnit);\n\
      if (optimalPosition > 50) {\n    // Proceed with interrupt attempt\n    caster->CastSpell(targetUnit,\
      \ INTERRUPT_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations including target movement
    prediction, spell duration estimation, and positional analysis. It may be called
    frequently during combat AI processing, so performance optimization is important.
    The returned value should not be interpreted as a direct coordinate but rather
    as a relative measure of interrupt opportunity.
  warnings: The method assumes the target unit is actively casting a spell or in a
    state where interruption is possible. Calling this method on non-casting targets
    may produce undefined behavior or misleading results. Ensure proper null checking
    before calling this method.
