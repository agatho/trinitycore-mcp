  class: SocialManager
  method: SetChatDelay
  signature: void SocialManager::SetChatDelay(uint32 minDelay, uint32 maxDelay)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the minimum and maximum delay for chat messages in the social manager.
  description: The SetChatDelay method configures the rate limiting parameters for
    chat messages within the SocialManager. This method establishes the minimum and
    maximum time intervals (in milliseconds) between consecutive chat messages sent
    by a player. The minimum delay prevents spamming, while the maximum delay can
    be used to enforce a maximum message frequency. These settings are typically applied
    to control chat behavior and maintain game balance, especially in scenarios where
    excessive messaging could disrupt gameplay or server performance.
  parameters:
  - name: minDelay
    description: The minimum time interval (in milliseconds) between consecutive chat
      messages. Must be a non-negative integer value.
  - name: maxDelay
    description: The maximum time interval (in milliseconds) between consecutive chat
      messages. Must be a non-negative integer value, typically greater than or equal
      to minDelay.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetChatDelay(1000, 5000); // Minimum 1 second, maximum 5 seconds
      between messages'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Chat Delays
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->SetChatDelay(0, 0); // No delays enforced'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the chat rate limiting system in TrinityCore.
    The values are stored internally and used to calculate cooldowns for each player's
    chat actions. Changes to these values will take effect immediately for subsequent
    chat messages.
  warnings: Setting both delays to zero disables all chat rate limiting, which may
    lead to spam or abuse. Ensure that delay values are reasonable to maintain game
    balance and prevent server load issues.
