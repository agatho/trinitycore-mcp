documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MovementContext object with default values.
  description: The MovementContext constructor initializes a new instance of the MovementContext
    class. This class is typically used to manage and store movement-related data
    for game entities such as players or creatures within the TrinityCore framework.
    The constructor sets up internal state variables to their default values, ensuring
    that the context is ready for use in movement calculations, pathfinding, or other
    movement-based operations. It's important to note that this is a constructor,
    not a regular method, and should be called when creating new instances of MovementContext.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a MovementContext instance
    code: 'MovementContext context;

      // The context is now initialized with default values

      // Ready to be used for movement operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets up the basic structure of the MovementContext object.
    In TrinityCore, movement contexts are often managed through factory patterns or
    by the game engine itself, so direct instantiation may be uncommon in typical
    gameplay code.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called manually on existing
    objects. Also, while the constructor initializes default values, the context may
    still require additional configuration before being used for meaningful movement
    operations.
