documentation:
  brief: Returns the local rotation quaternion of the game object.
  description: This method retrieves the local rotation of a GameObject in quaternion
    format, which represents the object's orientation in 3D space relative to its
    own coordinate system. The returned quaternion data contains the x, y, z, and
    w components that define the rotation. This is commonly used for determining object
    orientation during movement calculations or when working with spatial transformations
    in World of Warcraft's game mechanics. The method does not perform any transformation
    or conversion; it simply returns the stored local rotation data.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to the QuaternionData structure containing the
    local rotation components (x, y, z, w) that represent the object's orientation
    in 3D space. The quaternion values are typically normalized and can be used directly
    for rotation calculations or transformations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      QuaternionData rotation = go->GetLocalRotation();

      // Use rotation components to perform orientation calculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe as it returns a const reference to the stored data.
    Performance considerations are minimal since this is simply retrieving stored
    data without computation. Developers should be aware that the returned quaternion
    data is immutable and cannot be modified directly through this method.
  warnings: This method does not perform any validation or normalization of the quaternion
    data. If the GameObject's rotation has not been set properly, the returned values
    may be invalid or inconsistent. Always ensure proper initialization before using
    this method in calculations.
