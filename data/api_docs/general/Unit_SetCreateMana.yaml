  class: Unit
  method: SetCreateMana
  signature: void Unit::SetCreateMana(uint32 val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the mana value that will be created for this unit upon its creation.
  description: The SetCreateMana method configures the initial mana amount that a
    Unit will have when it is spawned or created in the game world. This value is
    typically used for NPCs or creatures that need to be initialized with a specific
    mana pool, rather than using their default mana calculation based on class and
    level. The method directly modifies an internal member variable of the Unit class,
    which affects how mana is allocated during unit initialization. This is particularly
    useful in custom scripts or game mechanics where specific mana values are required
    for balance or design purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The uint32 value representing the amount of mana to be set as the
      initial mana pool for this unit upon creation. Valid values are typically non-negative
      integers, with practical limits depending on game mechanics and server configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Initial Mana for an NPC
    code: 'Unit* npc = ...; // Get reference to an NPC

      npc->SetCreateMana(500); // Set the initial mana to 500'
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Mana System for Boss Units
    code: 'Creature* boss = ...; // Reference to a boss creature

      boss->SetCreateMana(10000); // Set high initial mana for boss mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the unit's mana at creation time. Any subsequent
    changes to mana after the unit is created should be handled via other methods
    like ModifyMana or SetMana. The value set by this method may be overridden or
    adjusted by certain game systems or scripts that modify unit stats post-creation.
  warnings: Modifying the create mana value of a unit after it has already been created
    will not affect its current mana pool. This method should only be used before
    the unit is fully initialized in the world. Incorrect use may lead to unexpected
    behavior if other systems depend on default mana calculations.
