  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool PerformanceOptimizer::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the performance optimization subsystem for the TrinityCore server.
  description: The Initialize method sets up internal data structures and configurations
    required for the PerformanceOptimizer class to function correctly. It typically
    performs setup tasks such as loading configuration parameters, initializing timers,
    allocating memory buffers, or registering callbacks with the core game loop. This
    method should be called once during server startup before any performance optimization
    features are utilized. The initialization process may involve reading settings
    from configuration files, validating system resources, and preparing internal
    state for monitoring and optimizing server performance metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required components
    were properly set up; returns false if an error occurred during initialization,
    which could indicate missing dependencies, invalid configuration values, or insufficient
    system resources.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;\nbool success = optimizer.Initialize();\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Performance optimization subsystem is ready\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Performance optimizer initialized successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initialize performance\
      \ optimizer.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup sequence and should
    not be invoked multiple times without proper cleanup. The initialization process
    may block briefly while loading configuration data or allocating resources, so
    it's recommended to call this early in the boot sequence to avoid delays.
  warnings: Calling Initialize more than once without proper deinitialization can
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that all performance optimization
    features are properly shut down before calling Initialize again.
