  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PowerWordShieldTracker class.
  description: 'The PowerWordShieldTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the PowerWordShieldTracker class. This class is responsible for tracking the
    application and removal of Power Word: Shield effects on targets within the TrinityCore
    framework. The constructor sets up internal data structures and state variables
    required to monitor shield applications, durations, and removals. It ensures that
    the tracker is properly initialized before any shield-related operations can be
    performed.'

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PowerWordShieldTracker instance
    code: 'PowerWordShieldTracker* tracker = new PowerWordShieldTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track shield applications'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation or initialization of external
    dependencies. It assumes that the underlying TrinityCore systems are already properly
    initialized. The tracker will only function correctly when used within a valid
    game context with proper player and target references.
