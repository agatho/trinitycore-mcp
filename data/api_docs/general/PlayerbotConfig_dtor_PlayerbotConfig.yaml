  signature: void PlayerbotConfig::~PlayerbotConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PlayerbotConfig instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotConfig class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore's playerbot system, this typically involves
    releasing configuration data structures, freeing memory pools, and ensuring no
    dangling pointers remain after the object is destroyed. This method is automatically
    invoked when a PlayerbotConfig instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted,
    making it essential for proper memory management within the bot AI subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of PlayerbotConfig instance
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    PlayerbotConfig config;\n    // Use config...\n\
      \    // config is automatically destroyed here when going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of PlayerbotConfig pointer
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig* config = new PlayerbotConfig();

      // Use config...

      delete config; // Triggers ~PlayerbotConfig() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only through proper object lifetime management.
    It is important to note that this destructor does not perform any specific cleanup
    related to active bot instances or running AI threads, as those are managed separately
    by the playerbot system. The destructor primarily focuses on internal data structures
    and memory management.
  warnings: Never manually call the destructor unless you have explicitly allocated
    memory using 'new'. Calling ~PlayerbotConfig() directly can lead to undefined
    behavior if the object's memory has already been freed or if it's part of a larger
    object hierarchy.
