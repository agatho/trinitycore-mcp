  class: Map
  method: SetWorldStateValue
  signature: void Map::SetWorldStateValue(int32 worldStateId, int32 value, bool hidden)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a world state value for the map, allowing control over game state variables.
  description: The SetWorldStateValue method allows developers to set specific world
    state values within a Map instance, which are used to track game state variables
    such as quest objectives, achievements, or other in-game events. This method is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft server-side scripting to update the state of
    various game elements. The method accepts a world state ID and value, with an
    optional hidden parameter that determines whether the value should be visible
    to players or not. It's important to note that this method does not directly affect
    player behavior but rather updates internal game state tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: worldStateId
    description: The unique identifier for the world state variable being set. This
      is typically a numeric ID representing a specific game state element like a
      quest objective or achievement.
  - name: value
    description: The value to set for the world state. This can be any integer value,
      including negative numbers, and represents the current state of the game element
      being tracked.
  - name: hidden
    description: When true, the world state value is hidden from players and only
      visible to server-side code. When false, the value is visible to players and
      can be displayed in UI elements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic World State Update
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      map->SetWorldStateValue(1234, 5678, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Hidden World State Value
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      map->SetWorldStateValue(9012, 3456, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly affects game state tracking.
    It's recommended to use this method in conjunction with other World of Warcraft
    APIs to ensure proper synchronization between server-side and client-side state
    updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inconsistent game state tracking,
    potentially causing issues with quest progression or achievement completion. Always
    verify that the worldStateId corresponds to valid game elements before calling
    this method.
