  method: QuantizePosition
  signature: int PathCache::QuantizePosition(const int & pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Quantizes a position value to a normalized integer representation for pathfinding
    calculations.
  description: The QuantizePosition method converts a given position coordinate into
    a quantized integer format suitable for internal pathfinding algorithms within
    the TrinityCore framework. This process typically involves scaling and rounding
    the input position to fit within a predefined grid or resolution system used by
    the navigation mesh. The method is commonly employed in AI pathfinding systems
    where precise coordinate values must be mapped to discrete grid positions for
    efficient computation. The quantization ensures that floating-point precision
    issues do not affect pathfinding accuracy while maintaining performance. This
    method does not modify any internal state and operates purely on the input value.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate to be quantized, typically representing an
      X or Y coordinate in world space. This value is usually a floating-point number
      that gets converted to an integer representation for pathfinding purposes.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the quantized position. The result
    is typically a scaled and rounded version of the input position, suitable for
    use in grid-based pathfinding calculations. Negative values may be returned if
    the input position is negative, and the scaling factor determines the resolution
    of the quantization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Quantization
    code: 'int quantizedX = pathCache->QuantizePosition(123.456f);

      // Returns an integer value representing the quantized version of 123.456

      int quantizedY = pathCache->QuantizePosition(-45.789f);

      // Returns a negative quantized integer for negative input'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding Coordinate Conversion
    code: 'float worldX = 1000.234f;

      float worldY = 500.678f;

      int gridX = pathCache->QuantizePosition(worldX);

      int gridY = pathCache->QuantizePosition(worldY);

      // Both grid coordinates are now suitable for pathfinding grid lookups'
    language: cpp
  notes: The quantization process likely involves a fixed scaling factor that maps
    world units to grid units. This method is part of the internal navigation system
    and should not be called directly by external modules without understanding the
    underlying coordinate system. The method is marked as const, indicating it does
    not modify any member variables.
  warnings: This method assumes that the input position is within a valid range for
    quantization. Extremely large or small values may result in integer overflow or
    loss of precision. Developers should ensure that the input coordinates are within
    expected bounds before calling this method.
