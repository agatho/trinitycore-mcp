documentation:
  brief: Moves an OutdoorPvP object to another OutdoorPvP object using move semantics.
  description: The OutdoorPvP move constructor transfers ownership of resources from
    one OutdoorPvP object to another. This is a fundamental C++ move semantics operation
    that allows efficient resource management by transferring internal data members
    rather than copying them. In the context of TrinityCore's outdoor PvP system,
    this constructor likely handles the transfer of state information such as zone
    control data, player tracking, and event handlers. The move constructor ensures
    that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an OutdoorPvP Object
    code: 'OutdoorPvP* source = new OutdoorPvP();

      OutdoorPvP target = std::move(*source);

      // source is now in a valid but unspecified state

      delete source;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when managing OutdoorPvP objects in containers or during object reassignment.
    It's important to note that after a move operation, the source object should not
    be used for any operations that require valid state.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Developers should ensure that no further operations are performed on
    the source object after calling this constructor.
