  class: DependencyValidator
  method: ValidateTBB
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::ValidateTBB()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the Thread Building Blocks (TBB) dependency for TrinityCore.
  description: The ValidateTBB method checks whether the required Thread Building
    Blocks library is properly installed and accessible within the TrinityCore environment.
    This validation ensures that the server can utilize TBB for parallel processing
    tasks, which are essential for performance optimization in multi-threaded operations.
    The method typically runs during server startup or configuration verification
    phases to confirm that all necessary dependencies are met before proceeding with
    normal operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Thread Building Blocks dependency is successfully validated
    and accessible; otherwise returns false if the validation fails due to missing
    libraries, incorrect versions, or other dependency issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (DependencyValidator::ValidateTBB()) {\n    std::cout << \"TBB dependency\
      \ is valid.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cerr << \"TBB dependency validation\
      \ failed!\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform system calls or file checks to verify TBB presence.
    It's recommended to call this during server initialization rather than runtime
    for optimal performance. The exact validation logic might vary depending on the
    build configuration and platform.
  warnings: If this validation fails, TrinityCore may experience degraded performance
    or runtime errors related to parallel processing features. Ensure that all required
    TBB libraries are properly installed in the system's library path before running
    the server.
