documentation:
  brief: Destroys an ArenaScript instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The ArenaScript destructor is automatically invoked when an ArenaScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the ArenaScript instance, including releasing
    memory and unregistering from game systems if applicable. In the context of TrinityCore's
    arena system, this destructor may handle cleanup of arena-related data structures,
    event handlers, or references to players and game objects that were managed by
    the script. The destructor is a critical part of the object lifecycle management
    within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ArenaScript instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ArenaScript* script = new ArenaScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack-based ArenaScript destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    ArenaScript script; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when\
      \ script goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The ArenaScript destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly
    managing memory. It is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    Developers should ensure that any resources allocated within the ArenaScript are
    properly released in the destructor to prevent memory leaks.
