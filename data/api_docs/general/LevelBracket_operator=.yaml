  method: operator=
  signature: LevelBracket & LevelBracket::operator=(const LevelBracket & other)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another LevelBracket object to this object
  description: The assignment operator for the LevelBracket class copies all member
    data from the provided source LevelBracket object to the current instance. This
    operation performs a deep copy of the bracket's properties, ensuring that both
    objects are independent after the assignment. The method follows standard C++
    assignment operator semantics and returns a reference to the assigned object for
    chaining operations. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, LevelBracket
    is typically used to define level-based stat or damage ranges for various game
    mechanics such as mob scaling, loot distribution, or spell effects.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The source LevelBracket object whose contents will be copied to this
      instance
  returns: A reference to the current LevelBracket object after assignment has been
    completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Operation
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket1;

      LevelBracket bracket2 = bracket1; // Uses copy constructor

      bracket2 = bracket1;        // Uses assignment operator'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Assignment Operations
    code: 'LevelBracket a, b, c;

      // ... initialize values ...

      a = b = c; // Chained assignment

      // Both a and b now contain the same values as c'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically auto-generated by the compiler unless explicitly
    overridden. When overridden, it should ensure proper handling of any dynamically
    allocated memory or complex data members within LevelBracket. The assignment operator
    should maintain object invariants and avoid self-assignment issues if not handled
    carefully.
  warnings: Be cautious when implementing custom assignment operators for classes
    containing pointers or references to avoid shallow copying issues. Ensure that
    the implementation properly handles potential memory leaks or dangling pointers
    if deep copying is required.
