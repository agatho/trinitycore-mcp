  brief: Moves the contents of another LfgGroupData object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for LfgGroupData transfers all resources
    and state from the right-hand side LfgGroupData object to this object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory
    or other resources without performing a deep copy. The source object is left in
    a valid but unspecified state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's
    LFG (Looking for Group) system, this method allows efficient reassignment of group
    data structures during gameplay operations such as group formation, dissolution,
    or reorganization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LfgGroupData object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'LfgGroupData group1;

      LfgGroupData group2 = std::move(group1); // Uses move assignment

      // group1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // group2 contains the moved data from group1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in LFG Context
    code: 'LfgGroupData newGroup;

      LfgGroupData oldGroup;

      // ... populate oldGroup with LFG data ...

      newGroup = std::move(oldGroup); // Efficiently transfer group data

      // oldGroup is now empty and ready for reuse'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's designed
    to be more efficient than copy assignment by transferring ownership of resources
    rather than copying them. The moved-from object should not be used after the operation
    unless it's subsequently assigned to or destroyed.
  warnings: After a move assignment, the source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state. Using the source object afterward without reassigning it can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that any pointers or references to the moved-from object are
    not accessed post-move.
