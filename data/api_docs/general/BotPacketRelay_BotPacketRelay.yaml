  brief: Copies the state and data of another BotPacketRelay instance to this instance
  description: The BotPacketRelay constructor is used to create a new instance of
    the BotPacketRelay class by copying the state and data from an existing BotPacketRelay
    object. This method performs a deep copy of all internal data members, ensuring
    that the newly created instance is independent of the source object. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this constructor likely handles the initialization
    of packet relay mechanisms for bot communication, allowing bots to properly forward
    or process game packets between clients and the server. The operation ensures
    that each bot instance maintains its own copy of relay data without affecting
    other instances.

  - title: Creating a new BotPacketRelay from an existing one
    code: 'BotPacketRelay originalRelay;

      // ... initialize originalRelay ...

      BotPacketRelay newRelay(originalRelay); // Uses the copy constructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, which means it should be used when creating a
    new BotPacketRelay instance that needs to mirror an existing one. The implementation
    likely handles memory management for internal packet buffers and relay configurations.
