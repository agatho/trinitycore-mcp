  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: DetectSeasonalPatterns
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::DetectSeasonalPatterns(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data to identify and detect seasonal trends for a specified
    item in the auction house.
  description: The DetectSeasonalPatterns method processes historical auction house
    data for a given item ID to identify recurring seasonal trends and patterns. This
    functionality is typically used by the game's economic system to predict future
    market behavior, adjust item pricing strategies, or provide insights to players
    about when certain items are likely to be in high or low demand. The method analyzes
    factors such as purchase frequency, price fluctuations, and time-based demand
    spikes that correlate with seasonal events or recurring in-game cycles. It requires
    access to historical auction data and performs internal computations to determine
    pattern significance and timing.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which seasonal patterns are
      to be detected. This must correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Detect seasonal patterns for a common weapon
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 weaponId = 12345;

      analysis.DetectSeasonalPatterns(weaponId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Detect seasonal patterns for a seasonal holiday item
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      uint32 holidayItemId = 98765;

      analysis.DetectSeasonalPatterns(holidayItemId);

      // This would analyze data to detect patterns related to holiday events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs intensive data processing on historical auction
    house records and may have performance implications when called frequently. The
    implementation probably relies on internal databases or caches of auction data
    that are updated periodically. It is designed to be part of a larger economic
    analysis system within TrinityCore.
  warnings: Calling this method without sufficient historical auction data may produce
    inaccurate or null results. The method assumes that the item ID provided exists
    in the database and that there is sufficient market activity for meaningful pattern
    detection.
