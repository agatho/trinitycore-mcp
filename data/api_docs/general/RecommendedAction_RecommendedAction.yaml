  brief: Initializes a recommended action for the AI system
  description: The RecommendedAction constructor initializes a new instance of the
    RecommendedAction class, setting up internal state for AI decision-making. This
    method is typically called during AI initialization or when a new action needs
    to be evaluated. The constructor prepares the object with default values and ensures
    proper memory allocation for action-related data structures. It does not perform
    any complex logic but rather sets the foundation for subsequent action evaluation
    methods.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'RecommendedAction action;

      // Initializes a new recommended action object

      // Ready for use in AI decision making'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system. Developers
    should not directly instantiate RecommendedAction objects unless implementing
    custom AI behavior. The class likely serves as part of a larger AI framework where
    actions are recommended based on various conditions and priorities.
