  brief: Resets the line-of-sight metrics to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated line-of-sight measurement data
    within the LoSMetrics class, restoring internal counters and statistics to their
    default values. This method is typically invoked when beginning a new measurement
    cycle or when resetting performance tracking for line-of-sight calculations in
    the game world. It ensures that subsequent measurements are not influenced by
    previous data, providing clean baseline metrics for analysis. The operation is
    atomic and does not require any external parameters or preconditions.
