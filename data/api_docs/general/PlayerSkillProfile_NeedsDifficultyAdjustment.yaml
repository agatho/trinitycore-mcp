documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's skill profile requires difficulty adjustment
    based on game mechanics.
  description: The NeedsDifficultyAdjustment method evaluates the current state of
    a player's skill profile to determine if adjustments are required due to changes
    in game difficulty or progression. This method is typically used during character
    loading, level-ups, or when entering different difficulty zones. It checks internal
    flags and conditions related to skill scaling, achievement progress, and player
    advancement to decide if any modifications to the skill set should be applied.
    The result directly influences how skills are displayed, modified, or recalculated
    in the context of varying game difficulties.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's skill profile requires difficulty adjustment;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates that certain skill values or modifiers
    need to be updated according to current game difficulty settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetSkillProfile()->NeedsDifficultyAdjustment()) {\n    // Apply\
      \ difficulty adjustment logic here\n    player->GetSkillProfile()->ApplyDifficultyAdjustments();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often called during critical game events such as zone transitions
    or level-ups. It may involve checking cached data and internal flags rather than
    performing heavy computations, making it relatively efficient. Developers should
    be aware that the result can change dynamically based on external factors like
    player progression or server settings.
