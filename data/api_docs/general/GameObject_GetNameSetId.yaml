  method: GetNameSetId
  signature: uint8 GameObject::GetNameSetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name set identifier associated with the GameObject.
  description: The GetNameSetId method retrieves the name set identifier that is used
    to determine which specific name set a GameObject belongs to. This identifier
    is crucial for determining how the GameObject's name is displayed in the game
    world, particularly when multiple name sets exist for different types of GameObjects.
    The method returns a uint8 value representing the name set ID, which can be used
    to distinguish between various naming conventions or configurations within the
    game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents a uint8 identifier that corresponds to the
    name set assigned to this GameObject. This value typically ranges from 0 to 255
    and indicates the specific name set configuration for the object, allowing developers
    to differentiate between various naming behaviors or configurations in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 nameSetId = gameObject->GetNameSetId();\nif (nameSetId == 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle default name set\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject-related
    methods to determine the full name configuration of an object. It may be called
    frequently during game logic processing, so performance considerations should
    be taken into account when using this method in loops or high-frequency operations.
  warnings: Care must be taken when interpreting the returned value as it may vary
    based on the specific GameObject type and its associated name set configuration.
    Incorrect handling of name set IDs can lead to display issues or misconfiguration
    of GameObject names in the game world.
