documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground is an arena type.
  description: The isArena() method checks if the current battleground instance is
    classified as an arena. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, battlegrounds
    are categorized into different types such as arenas and normal battlegrounds.
    This method returns true if the battleground is specifically an arena (like Eye
    of the Storm or Alterac Valley when configured as arena), and false otherwise.
    It is commonly used in game logic to differentiate behavior between arena and
    non-arena battlegrounds, particularly for handling specific rules, scoring systems,
    or player interactions unique to arenas.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battleground is an arena type; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if current battleground is an arena
    code: "if (bg->isArena()) {\n    // Handle arena-specific logic\n    SendPacketToAll(arenaMessage);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle normal battleground logic\n    SendPacketToAll(normalMessage);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal battleground type flags set during battleground
    creation or initialization. It should be used in contexts where arena-specific
    behavior is required, such as scoring systems, rewards, or rule enforcement.
