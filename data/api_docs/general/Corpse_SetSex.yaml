documentation:
  brief: Sets the gender of the corpse to the specified value.
  description: The SetSex method updates the gender attribute of a Corpse object.
    This method is typically used during the corpse creation process or when modifying
    an existing corpse's appearance to reflect the player's gender at the time of
    death. The sex parameter should correspond to valid gender constants defined in
    the game's enumeration system, usually 0 for male, 1 for female, and sometimes
    2 for none or unknown. This change affects how the corpse is displayed in the
    world and may influence certain gameplay mechanics related to corpse handling,
    such as loot distribution or resurrection effects.
  parameters:
  - name: sex
    description: The gender value to assign to the corpse. Valid values are typically
      0 (male), 1 (female), and possibly 2 (none/unknown) depending on the game's
      implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Corpse Gender to Female
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    corpse->SetSex(1);\
      \ // Set gender to female\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Gender Assignment Based on Player
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nCorpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\n\
      if (corpse)\n{\n    int playerGender = player->getGender();\n    corpse->SetSex(playerGender);\
      \ // Match corpse gender to player's gender\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the Corpse object and
    should be called before the corpse is made visible to players. The change will
    persist until explicitly modified again or the corpse is destroyed. This method
    does not trigger any events or callbacks, so additional logic for visual updates
    or game state changes must be handled separately.
  warnings: Calling SetSex with an invalid gender value may result in undefined behavior
    or visual glitches in the corpse's appearance. Ensure that the sex parameter conforms
    to the expected enumeration values used by the TrinityCore server. This method
    should not be called on corpses that are already in a state where they cannot
    be modified (e.g., after being looted).
