  class: SoulShardSystem
  method: Initialize
  signature: void SoulShardSystem::Initialize(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the soul shard system for a bot, setting up required data structures
    and configurations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the SoulShardSystem for operation by
    allocating necessary resources, configuring internal state variables, and establishing
    initial settings for the bot's soul shard management. This method is typically
    called during bot creation or activation to ensure that all dependent systems
    are properly initialized before any soul shard operations are performed. The method
    does not require any input parameters beyond a pointer to the bot instance, which
    it uses to configure system-specific settings.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot instance that will utilize the soul shard system.
      This parameter is essential for initializing system-specific configurations
      and linking the soul shard functionality to the correct bot context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SoulShardSystem shardSystem;

      Bot* myBot = new Bot();

      shardSystem.Initialize(&myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance to avoid potential
    memory leaks or duplicate initializations. The system assumes that the bot pointer
    is valid and properly allocated before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same bot instance may lead to
    undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure that the bot parameter is not null
    before invoking this method.
