  class: SpawnCircuitBreaker
  method: IsInitialized
  signature: bool SpawnCircuitBreaker::IsInitialized() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the spawn circuit breaker has been properly initialized and
    is ready for use.
  description: The IsInitialized method determines if the SpawnCircuitBreaker instance
    has completed its initialization process. This method is typically used to verify
    that all internal resources, configurations, and state variables have been correctly
    set up before attempting to perform any operations with the circuit breaker. In
    the context of TrinityCore's AI and spawn management systems, this check ensures
    that spawning logic can safely proceed without risk of undefined behavior or access
    violations. The method performs no side effects and is generally called prior
    to invoking other methods in the class to ensure system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the SpawnCircuitBreaker has been successfully initialized
    and is ready for use; otherwise returns false if initialization is incomplete
    or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "SpawnCircuitBreaker breaker;\nif (breaker.IsInitialized()) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with spawn operations\n    breaker.AttemptSpawn();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Spawn circuit breaker not initialized\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be lightweight and should not involve heavy computations
    or locking mechanisms. It's typically used in conditional logic before performing
    potentially expensive operations.
