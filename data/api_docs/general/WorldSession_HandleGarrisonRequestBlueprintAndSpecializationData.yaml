documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to retrieve garrison blueprint and specialization
    data.
  description: This method processes incoming client requests for garrison blueprint
    and specialization information. It is typically invoked when a player interacts
    with their garrison interface, particularly when viewing or managing building
    blueprints and specializations. The method retrieves the relevant data from the
    server's internal garrison system and sends it back to the client in an appropriate
    packet format. This functionality supports the garrison management features in
    World of Warcraft, allowing players to view available building options and their
    associated specializations.

  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGarrisonRequestBlueprintAndSpecializationData(WorldPackets::Garrison::GarrisonRequestBlueprintAndSpecializationData&\
      \ garrisonRequestBlueprintAndSpecializationData)\n{\n    // Process the request\
      \ and send relevant data to client\n    SendGarrisonBlueprintAndSpecializationData();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the garrison system implementation in TrinityCore.
    It relies on internal garrison data structures and should only be called when
    a valid session exists with an active garrison. The method assumes that the client
    has proper authentication and authorization to access garrison information.
