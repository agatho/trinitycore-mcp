  brief: Resets the adaptive behavior manager's internal state and clears all tracked
    data.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the AdaptiveBehaviorManager,
    clearing any previously stored behavioral data, resetting counters, and preparing
    the system for a new behavioral analysis cycle. This method is typically invoked
    when starting a new encounter or when the AI needs to be reconfigured to adapt
    to changing environmental conditions. It ensures that all internal tracking mechanisms
    are cleared and ready for fresh data collection.

    to ensure clean state. It does not affect external AI configurations or settings,
    only the internal tracking data.
