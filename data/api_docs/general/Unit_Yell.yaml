  class: Unit
  method: Yell
  signature: void Unit::Yell(uint32 textId, const int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Makes the unit emit a yell message with the specified text ID
  description: The Yell method allows a Unit (such as an NPC or player) to send a
    yell message to nearby players within the same zone. The method uses a text ID
    which corresponds to entries in the `broadcast_text` table, allowing for dynamic
    text messages. The target parameter specifies the intended recipient of the yell,
    though it can be null if the yell is meant for all players in the area. This method
    is commonly used in quest scripts or AI behavior to communicate with players.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The unique identifier for the text message in the broadcast_text
      table, which determines what is yelled
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to a target player or null if the yell should be broadcast
      to all players in the zone
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Yell Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = ...;

      unit->Yell(12345, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Yell with Target
    code: 'Unit* unit = ...;

      Player* target = ...;

      unit->Yell(12345, &target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other AI or quest-related
    methods. It should be used carefully as it may affect performance if called too
    frequently. The textId must correspond to valid entries in the broadcast_text
    table.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause client-side issues or incorrect
    behavior if the textId is invalid or not properly configured. Always ensure that
    the textId corresponds to a valid broadcast_text entry before calling this method.
