documentation:
  brief: Calculates the adaptive difficulty group skill level based on player count
  description: The CalculateGroupSkillLevel method determines the appropriate skill
    level for a group of players in the context of adaptive difficulty scaling. This
    method is used by TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty system to adjust enemy difficulty
    dynamically based on the number of players in a group. The calculation takes into
    account the player count and applies a mathematical formula to determine an appropriate
    skill level that reflects the group's collective strength. This ensures that encounters
    remain appropriately challenging regardless of group size, maintaining game balance
    and player engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: The number of players in the group for which to calculate the skill
      level. Must be a positive integer representing valid player count.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated adaptive difficulty skill
    level for the specified group size. The value typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0,
    where 0.0 represents minimum difficulty and 1.0 represents maximum difficulty.
    Values may exceed 1.0 in certain edge cases or for very large groups.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with single player
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty difficulty;

      float skillLevel = difficulty.CalculateGroupSkillLevel(1);

      // Returns the skill level for a solo player group'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with typical group size
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty difficulty;

      int groupSize = 5;

      float skillLevel = difficulty.CalculateGroupSkillLevel(groupSize);

      // Returns the skill level for a 5-player group'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's adaptive difficulty system and is typically
    called during dungeon/raid encounter setup. The calculation may involve logarithmic
    scaling or other mathematical functions to ensure smooth difficulty progression
    across different group sizes. The method is designed to be efficient and thread-safe
    for concurrent use in multi-threaded server environments.
  warnings: The method assumes valid player count inputs. Passing negative values
    or extremely large numbers may produce unexpected results. The exact calculation
    algorithm is implementation-specific and may vary between TrinityCore versions.
