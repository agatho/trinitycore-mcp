  class: Trigger
  method: GetAverageTriggerRate
  signature: float Trigger::GetAverageTriggerRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average trigger rate of the current trigger object.
  description: The GetAverageTriggerRate method computes the average rate at which
    a trigger event occurs, typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment
    for managing scripted events or quest triggers. This value represents how frequently
    the trigger is expected to activate over time, often expressed in seconds per
    activation. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only. It
    may be utilized by AI systems or game logic to determine timing behavior for dynamic
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average trigger rate in seconds per activation.
    A lower value indicates a higher frequency of triggering, while a higher value
    suggests less frequent activation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float rate = trigger->GetAverageTriggerRate();\nif (rate > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use the rate to schedule next event\n    sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_STRING,\
      \ \"Trigger rate is %.2f seconds\", rate);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that trigger data has been properly initialized and that
    timing information is available. It should not be called on uninitialized or invalid
    trigger objects.
  warnings: Calling this method on a trigger with no defined activation pattern may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure proper initialization
    before use.
