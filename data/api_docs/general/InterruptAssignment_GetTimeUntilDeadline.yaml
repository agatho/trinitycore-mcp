  class: InterruptAssignment
  method: GetTimeUntilDeadline
  signature: uint32 InterruptAssignment::GetTimeUntilDeadline() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the time remaining until the interrupt assignment's
    deadline expires.
  description: The GetTimeUntilDeadline method computes the number of milliseconds
    remaining before an interrupt assignment reaches its deadline. This is typically
    used in game mechanics where actions must be completed within a specific timeframe,
    such as spell interrupts or ability cooldowns. The method performs a simple time
    difference calculation between the current system time and the stored deadline
    time. It is commonly called during game loop updates to determine if an interrupt
    condition has expired. The result represents the remaining duration in milliseconds,
    which can be used for UI timers, logging, or triggering events when time runs
    out.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds remaining
    until the interrupt assignment's deadline. If the deadline has already passed,
    it returns 0. The maximum possible return value depends on the system's time resolution
    and the deadline set during object initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Time Remaining for Interrupt
    code: "InterruptAssignment* assignment = new InterruptAssignment();\n// ... initialize\
      \ assignment with a deadline ...\nuint32 remainingTime = assignment->GetTimeUntilDeadline();\n\
      if (remainingTime == 0)\n{\n    // Deadline has expired\n    printf(\"Interrupt\
      \ has expired!\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Time remaining: %u ms\\n\",\
      \ remainingTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Time Remaining for UI Updates
    code: "void UpdateInterruptTimerUI(InterruptAssignment* assignment)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ timeLeft = assignment->GetTimeUntilDeadline();\n    if (timeLeft > 0)\n  \
      \  {\n        // Update progress bar or countdown display\n        float progress\
      \ = static_cast<float>(timeLeft) / 1000.0f; // Convert to seconds\n        UpdateProgressBar(progress);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle expired interrupt\n        HideInterruptUI();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate system timekeeping. The underlying deadline
    value should be set using a reliable time source such as game time or system monotonic
    clock to ensure consistent behavior. The return value is in milliseconds, making
    it suitable for precise timing calculations. This method does not modify the internal
    state of the object and is safe to call multiple times.
  warnings: Be aware that if the deadline was set using a different time source than
    the one used for GetTimeUntilDeadline, the result may be inaccurate. Also, calling
    this method in high-frequency loops without proper caching may impact performance
    due to repeated time calculations.
