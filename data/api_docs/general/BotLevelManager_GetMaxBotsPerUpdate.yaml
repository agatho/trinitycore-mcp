  method: GetMaxBotsPerUpdate
  signature: uint32 BotLevelManager::GetMaxBotsPerUpdate() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of bots allowed to be updated in a single processing
    cycle.
  description: The GetMaxBotsPerUpdate method retrieves the configured limit for how
    many bot instances can be processed during one update iteration. This value is
    typically used to control performance and resource usage by preventing excessive
    CPU load from updating too many bots simultaneously. The setting helps balance
    server responsiveness with bot management efficiency, especially in environments
    with a large number of player-controlled bots. This method does not modify any
    internal state and simply returns a cached or configured value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of bots that can be updated
    per processing cycle. This value is usually configured via server settings or
    constants and defines a hard limit on bot update concurrency.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve max bots per update for performance logging
    code: 'uint32 maxBots = botLevelManager->GetMaxBotsPerUpdate();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, "Max bots per update: %u", maxBots);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or performance
    monitoring to ensure bot updates are within acceptable limits. The returned value
    may be dynamically adjusted based on server load or configuration changes, but
    this behavior depends on implementation details of the BotLevelManager class.
