  brief: Summon changes item to a different item during spell effect execution
  description: This method handles the spell effect that summons a change item during
    spell execution. It typically occurs when a spell requires an item to be changed
    or replaced with another item, such as in cases where a spell modifies an item's
    properties or creates a new item from existing ones. The method operates within
    the context of World of Warcraft's spell system and is used for handling item-based
    spell effects that involve item changes during execution.

  notes: This method is part of the spell effect handling system and should be used
    carefully in conjunction with other item-related methods. It may require additional
    checks to ensure proper item validation before execution.
  warnings: This method may not be directly callable from outside the spell class;
    it's typically invoked through internal spell mechanics or by specific spell effects.
