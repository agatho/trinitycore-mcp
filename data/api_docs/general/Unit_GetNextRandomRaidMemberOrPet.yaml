  signature: Unit * Unit::GetNextRandomRaidMemberOrPet(float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the next random raid member or pet within specified radius
  description: This method retrieves a random raid member or pet from the current
    raid group within the specified radius. It is commonly used for targeting purposes
    in raid encounters, particularly when seeking a random target within a defined
    range. The method considers both players and pets in the raid group, ensuring
    that the returned unit is either a raid member or a pet belonging to a raid member.
    This functionality is essential for implementing various game mechanics such as
    AoE attacks, random target selection, and raid-based encounters where random targeting
    is required.
  parameters:
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance within which to search for raid members or pets.
      This parameter defines the radius of the area around the current unit where
      targets will be considered.
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Unit object representing either a raid member or
    pet within the specified radius. If no valid target is found within the radius,
    the method returns nullptr. The returned unit can be either a player or a pet,
    depending on what's available in the raid group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = this->GetNextRandomRaidMemberOrPet(10.0f);\nif (target !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Use target for attack or spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally uses a random selection algorithm to choose from available
    raid members or pets, ensuring that the result is truly random. Performance considerations
    include the overhead of checking all raid members within the radius, which may
    impact in large raid groups. Thread safety is not an issue as long as the method
    is called on a valid unit object.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in situations where the target needs
    to be selected based on specific criteria or when targeting is required for spell
    effects. Be aware that the method will return nullptr if no raid members or pets
    are found within the specified radius, which could lead to errors if not handled
    properly.
