documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is a spirit healer.
  description: This method checks if the Unit object represents a spirit healer, which
    is typically a NPC that can resurrect players from death. The method returns true
    when the unit is classified as a spirit healer, indicating it has the ability
    to resurrect players and restore them to life. This functionality is crucial for
    player character interactions in World of Warcraft, particularly during instances
    where players may need to be resurrected or when dealing with death-related mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is a spirit healer, false otherwise. The method
    specifically checks for the presence of a spirit healer flag or classification
    within the Unit's data structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsSpiritHealer())\n{\n    // Handle resurrection logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details may vary based on TrinityCore version and specific
    unit type. This method likely checks against internal flags or classifications
    rather than direct data access.
  warnings: This method should not be used for general unit checking without understanding
    the implications, as it may affect gameplay mechanics related to resurrection
    and death.
