  description: This method initializes the quest's offer reward information by reading
    data from database fields. It processes the reward data including items, money,
    experience points, and reputation rewards that players receive when completing
    the quest. The method handles the parsing and storage of these reward components
    in preparation for quest completion and reward distribution to players.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Quest quest;

      quest.LoadQuestOfferReward(fields);

      // This method is typically called internally during quest loading process'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest loading mechanism in TrinityCore.
    It should not be called directly by external code but rather through the quest
    initialization process. The method expects database fields to contain valid reward
    data for proper operation.
  warnings: This method should only be used during quest loading and initialization,
    not during runtime execution. Calling it outside of proper context may cause undefined
    behavior or data corruption.
