documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest identifier associated with the game object template.
  description: The GetQuestID method returns the unique quest identifier (QuestId)
    that is linked to this game object template. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    game objects can be associated with quests, typically representing quest objectives
    such as chests, doors, or other interactive elements. This method allows scripts
    and systems to determine which quest a particular game object is related to, enabling
    proper quest tracking and interaction logic. The returned value corresponds to
    the QuestId field in the game object's database entry and should be used in conjunction
    with the quest system to manage quest states and rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the quest identifier associated with this game
    object template. If no quest is linked to the object, the method returns 0, indicating
    no active quest association.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest association
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate)\n{\n    uint32 questId = goTemplate->GetQuestID();\n    if (questId\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        // This game object is associated with a quest\n    \
      \    sLog->outString(\"GameObject ID %u is linked to Quest ID %u\", 12345, questId);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No quest association\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      GameObject ID %u has no quest association\", 12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the GameObject system and
    quest management code. The returned QuestId should be validated against the active
    quests in the player's quest log to ensure proper interaction handling. This method
    does not perform any database lookups or computations; it simply returns a cached
    value from the game object template data structure.
