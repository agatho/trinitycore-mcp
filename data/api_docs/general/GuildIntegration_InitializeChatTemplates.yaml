documentation:
  brief: Initializes chat templates for guild integration functionality.
  description: The InitializeChatTemplates method sets up and prepares all necessary
    chat message templates used by the GuildIntegration system. This method is typically
    called during server initialization or when a guild is created to ensure that
    all predefined chat formats, such as announcements, notifications, and member
    messages, are properly configured. It loads default template strings from configuration
    files or database entries and prepares internal data structures for efficient
    template usage during runtime. The method ensures that guild-specific chat formatting
    is ready before any chat operations begin.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.InitializeChatTemplates();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in duplicate template entries or memory leaks. The templates
    are typically loaded from server configuration files or database tables and cached
    for fast access.
  warnings: Do not call this method after guild chat operations have begun, as it
    may invalidate existing template references and cause undefined behavior. Ensure
    all required configuration files are present before calling this method.
