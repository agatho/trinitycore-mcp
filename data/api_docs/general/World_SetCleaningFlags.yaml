documentation:
  brief: Sets the cleaning flags for the world environment
  description: The SetCleaningFlags method configures internal cleaning flags within
    the World class that control various cleanup operations and maintenance tasks
    performed by the game server. These flags typically determine which systems or
    data structures should be processed during periodic cleaning cycles, such as removing
    expired objects, clearing temporary data, or performing memory management tasks.
    The method directly modifies internal state variables without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask value specifying which cleaning operations should be enabled.
      Each bit represents a different cleaning subsystem or operation type. Valid
      values are defined by the World::CleaningFlags enumeration or constants, typically
      including flags for object cleanup, memory management, database maintenance,
      and other periodic tasks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable basic cleaning operations
    code: World::instance()->SetCleaningFlags(CLEANING_FLAG_UNITS | CLEANING_FLAG_GAMEOBJECTS);
    language: cpp
  - title: Enable all cleaning operations
    code: World::instance()->SetCleaningFlags(0xFFFFFFFF);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or configuration
    changes. The cleaning flags are usually processed during periodic maintenance
    intervals controlled by the server's main loop. Modifying these flags at runtime
    may affect system performance and should be done carefully.
  warnings: Setting inappropriate cleaning flags can lead to unexpected behavior or
    performance degradation. Ensure that only valid flag combinations are used, as
    invalid values may cause undefined behavior in the cleaning subsystem.
