documentation:
  brief: Converts the priority value to its string representation.
  description: The ToString method converts the internal priority value of a TrinityCorePriority
    object into a human-readable string format. This is commonly used for logging,
    debugging, or displaying priority levels in user interfaces. The method does not
    modify the object's state and is typically called on priority enums or classes
    that represent different levels of importance or urgency within the TrinityCore
    framework. It ensures consistent formatting across different components of the
    game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the textual representation of the priority value.
    The exact string format depends on the implementation of the TrinityCorePriority
    class, but typically corresponds to standard priority labels such as 'Low', 'Medium',
    'High', or 'Critical'.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TrinityCorePriority priority(2);

      std::string priorityStr = priority.ToString();

      // Returns a string like "Medium" or "2" depending on implementation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a const function, meaning it does
    not alter the object's state. It may use internal lookup tables or switch statements
    to map numeric priority values to their string representations. The performance
    impact is minimal since it only involves string conversion and lookup operations.
