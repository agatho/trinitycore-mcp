    & newPosition)
documentation:
  brief: Handles movement of a group member to a new position within the group formation.
  description: The HandleMemberMovement method is responsible for managing the positioning
    of individual group members during group formation or repositioning events. This
    method updates the internal state of the group formation system to reflect the
    new position of a specified group member, ensuring proper alignment and spacing
    within the group's tactical formation. It typically gets invoked when a player
    moves within a group, either through natural movement or forced positioning commands.
    The method ensures that all group members maintain appropriate relative positions
    according to the formation rules defined for the group.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose position is
      being updated. This value must correspond to a valid player in the current group.
  - name: newPosition
    description: The new position index within the group formation. This represents
      the desired slot or location for the member, typically ranging from 0 to N-1
      where N is the total number of group members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move a group member to position 2
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->HandleMemberMovement(playerGuid, 2);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reposition multiple members in sequence
    code: "for (uint32 i = 0; i < groupMembers.size(); ++i)\n{\n    formation->HandleMemberMovement(groupMembers[i],\
      \ i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group formation system is properly initialized
    and that the memberGuid corresponds to an actual group member. The newPosition
    parameter should be validated against the maximum allowed positions in the formation
    to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid memberGuid or a newPosition outside
    the valid range may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all group
    members are properly registered before attempting to move them.
