  class: QuestPickup
  method: MoveToQuestGiver
  signature: bool QuestPickup::MoveToQuestGiver(Player * bot, uint32 questGiverGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot player to the quest giver's location.
  description: The MoveToQuestGiver method is responsible for navigating a bot player
    character to the location of a specified quest giver within the game world. This
    functionality is typically used in automated questing scripts or AI systems where
    the bot needs to physically approach an NPC to interact with them for quest-related
    actions. The method handles pathfinding and movement logic internally, ensuring
    the player reaches the quest giver's position. It requires a valid quest giver
    GUID to determine the target location and will return false if the movement cannot
    be initiated or completed successfully.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      will be moved to the quest giver.
  - name: questGiverGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the quest giver NPC to which the
      bot should move. This GUID must correspond to a valid NPC in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the movement to the quest giver was successfully initiated
    and completed, or false if the movement failed due to invalid parameters, unreachable
    destination, or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToQuestGiver
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nuint32 questGiverGuid =\
      \ 12345;\nif (QuestPickup::MoveToQuestGiver(bot, questGiverGuid)) {\n    //\
      \ Movement successful, proceed with quest interaction\n    bot->SendQuestGiverQuestList();\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle movement failure\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Failed to move to quest giver.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying pathfinding system of TrinityCore and
    may not work correctly if the quest giver is located in an inaccessible area or
    if the bot's movement is restricted by game mechanics. The method does not perform
    any quest state checks; it only handles the physical movement aspect.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided questGiverGuid corresponds to a valid NPC in
    the current map, otherwise the method may fail silently or cause unexpected behavior.
    Also, calling this method during active combat or while the bot is already moving
    might lead to conflicts in movement logic.
