  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CompleteEncounter
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CompleteEncounter(Group * group, uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a specified dungeon encounter for the given group.
  description: The CompleteEncounter method is used to mark a specific dungeon encounter
    as completed for a given group. This method typically updates the encounter state
    within the dungeon's behavior system, potentially rewarding players with loot,
    experience, or quest progress. It may also trigger related events such as updating
    achievement criteria or advancing the dungeon's progression state. The method
    assumes that the encounter has been successfully defeated and that all necessary
    conditions for completion have been met.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players who
      completed the encounter. Must not be null.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific dungeon encounter being completed.
      This ID corresponds to a defined encounter within the dungeon's encounter system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Encounter Completion
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = ...; // Assume group is initialized

      uint32 bossEncounterId = 12345;

      DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.CompleteEncounter(playerGroup, bossEncounterId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after verifying that the encounter has
    been properly defeated and all players in the group are eligible for rewards.
    The method does not validate whether the group members are still present or in
    the dungeon; it assumes proper state management is handled elsewhere.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the encounter is actually completed
    may lead to incorrect progression states, reward distribution issues, or inconsistent
    achievement tracking. Ensure that all preconditions for encounter completion are
    met before invoking this method.
