  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: SetLearningRate
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::SetLearningRate(float rate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the learning rate for performance optimization algorithms within the
    TrinityCore system.
  description: The SetLearningRate method configures the rate at which performance
    optimization algorithms adjust their parameters during runtime. This is typically
    used in AI-driven systems or dynamic performance tuning mechanisms where the system
    learns and adapts its behavior based on observed performance metrics. The learning
    rate determines how quickly the system responds to changes in performance conditions,
    with higher values leading to more aggressive adjustments and lower values resulting
    in smoother but slower convergence. This method directly affects the responsiveness
    of the performance optimizer without altering other optimization parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: rate
    description: A floating-point value representing the learning rate for performance
      optimization. Valid range is typically between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 means
      no learning (static behavior) and 1.0 represents maximum responsiveness to performance
      changes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a moderate learning rate
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetLearningRate(0.5f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring aggressive performance tuning
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetLearningRate(0.9f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before enabling performance optimization to
    ensure proper initialization of learning parameters. The learning rate value affects
    the stability and convergence speed of optimization algorithms, so values outside
    the typical 0.0-1.0 range may produce unpredictable behavior.
  warnings: Setting the learning rate too high (above 1.0) can cause instability in
    performance tuning algorithms, potentially leading to oscillating or diverging
    optimization results. Values near zero will make the system extremely slow to
    respond to performance changes, reducing effectiveness.
