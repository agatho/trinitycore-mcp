  method: GetVendorItemCurrentCount
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetVendorItemCurrentCount(const VendorItem * vItem)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current count of a vendor item for the creature.
  description: This method retrieves the current quantity of a specific vendor item
    available for sale in the creature's vendor list. It is used to determine how
    many items remain in stock for a given vendor item, which can affect the availability
    and pricing of items during trading. The method typically returns the number of
    items currently available or a value indicating whether the item is in stock or
    not. This functionality is essential for implementing dynamic vendor behavior
    and managing item availability in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the current count of the specified vendor item, representing how
    many items are currently available in the creature's vendor list. If the item
    is not found or has no stock, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 count = creature->GetVendorItemCurrentCount(vendorItem);\nif (count\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Item is available\n    // Do something with the count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other vendor-related methods
    to manage item availability and stock tracking. It may be called during vendor
    interactions or when checking item availability for purchase.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return 0 if the item is not
    found or has no stock, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about item availability.
    Ensure proper handling of edge cases in your code.
