  class: EscortAI
  method: SetMaxPlayerDistance
  signature: void EscortAI::SetMaxPlayerDistance(float newMax)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum allowed distance between the escort target and the player.
  description: The SetMaxPlayerDistance method configures the maximum distance that
    a player can be from an escorted NPC before the escort AI triggers certain behaviors,
    such as stopping or alerting. This is commonly used in quest-related AI to ensure
    that players remain close enough to the NPC during escort sequences. The value
    is typically set in yards and affects how the AI handles player movement and positioning
    during the escort process.
  parameters:
  - name: newMax
    description: The new maximum distance (in yards) allowed between the escort target
      and the player. Must be a positive floating-point number.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Player Distance for Escort
    code: "void SetEscortMaxDistance(float maxDist)\n{\n    if (m_escortAI)\n    \
      \    m_escortAI->SetMaxPlayerDistance(maxDist);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Distance Based on Quest Stage
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (quest->GetQuestId()\
      \ == 12345)\n        m_escortAI->SetMaxPlayerDistance(30.0f);\n    else\n  \
      \      m_escortAI->SetMaxPlayerDistance(15.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the behavior of the EscortAI during quest
    escort events. It's important to set this value appropriately to maintain gameplay
    balance and prevent players from easily breaking the escort sequence by moving
    too far away.
  warnings: Setting a very large distance may cause the escort AI to become ineffective
    if the player strays too far, while setting it too low might make the quest feel
    restrictive or frustrating for players. Ensure that the value aligns with the
    intended gameplay experience.
