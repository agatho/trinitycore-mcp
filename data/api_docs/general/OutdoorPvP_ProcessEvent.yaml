  signature: void OutdoorPvP::ProcessEvent(int * target, int eventId, int * invoker)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an event within the OutdoorPvP system, handling interactions between
    game objects and players.
  description: The ProcessEvent method is a core function in the OutdoorPvP class
    responsible for managing and executing events that occur within outdoor player-versus-player
    zones. This method handles various game mechanics such as capturing territories,
    triggering objectives, or responding to player actions. It typically receives
    event identifiers and associated data to determine how to process these events
    within the context of the specific OutdoorPvP zone. The method may update zone
    states, award rewards, or modify player conditions based on the event type and
    invoker information.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target of the event, which
      could be a game object ID, player GUID, or territory identifier depending on
      the event type.
  - name: eventId
    description: Integer identifier specifying the type of event being processed.
      This value determines how the method should interpret and handle the event within
      the OutdoorPvP system.
  - name: invoker
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the entity that triggered or invoked
      the event, typically a player's GUID or object identifier.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic OutdoorPvP Event Processing
    code: "void HandleCaptureEvent(OutdoorPvP* pvpZone, uint64 targetGuid, uint32\
      \ eventId, uint64 invokerGuid)\n{\n    int target = static_cast<int>(targetGuid);\n\
      \    int eventID = static_cast<int>(eventId);\n    int invoker = static_cast<int>(invokerGuid);\n\
      \    pvpZone->ProcessEvent(&target, eventID, &invoker);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    events occur in OutdoorPvP zones. Developers should not directly invoke this method
    unless implementing custom OutdoorPvP logic. The method may modify internal zone
    states and should be called with appropriate event IDs and valid target/invoker
    parameters.
  warnings: Incorrect parameter values, particularly invalid GUIDs or undefined event
    IDs, can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes within the OutdoorPvP system.
    Always validate input parameters before calling this method.
