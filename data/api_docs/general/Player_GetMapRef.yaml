  method: GetMapRef
  signature: int & Player::GetMapRef()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the map reference identifier for the player's current map.
  description: The GetMapRef method retrieves the unique map reference identifier
    associated with the player's current location within the game world. This identifier
    is used internally by TrinityCore to track and manage player positioning across
    different maps and zones. The method returns a reference to an integer value that
    represents the map ID, which is essential for various game mechanics including
    zone-based interactions, quest tracking, and spatial awareness. It should be noted
    that this value may change when the player moves between different maps or zones,
    making it crucial for maintaining accurate state information during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to an integer representing the map identifier for the
    player's current location. This value corresponds to the map ID used internally
    by TrinityCore and can be used to determine which map the player is currently
    located in, with potential implications for zone-based gameplay, quest progression,
    and spatial tracking.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int mapId = player->GetMapRef();\nif (mapId == 141) {\n    // Player is\
      \ in the Eastern Kingdoms\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for internal game state tracking and should
    not be modified directly. The returned value may change during gameplay when the
    player moves between different maps or zones, so it's important to understand
    that this reference represents the current map ID rather than a fixed identifier.
  warnings: The returned integer value should not be used for direct comparison with
    other map IDs without considering that the player might be in a different map.
    Also, since this is a reference, modifying the returned value directly could lead
    to unexpected behavior in game mechanics.
