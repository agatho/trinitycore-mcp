documentation:
  brief: Updates the affliction state of the warlock, managing spell effects and aura
    application.
  description: The UpdateAfflictionState method is responsible for maintaining and
    updating the current affliction state of an Affliction Warlock class instance.
    This includes managing active affliction spells such as Corruption, Unstable Affliction,
    and other debuff effects that are applied to targets. The method typically handles
    the logic for applying, refreshing, or removing these affliction effects based
    on the warlock's current spell rotation and combat state. It ensures that the
    warlock's affliction abilities are properly synchronized with the game's combat
    system and maintains proper cooldown tracking for these abilities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateAfflictionState Call
    code: "void UpdateAfflictionState()\n{\n    // Implementation would handle updating\
      \ all affliction effects\n    // This method is typically called from the AI\
      \ update loop\n    if (m_isInCombat)\n    {\n        ApplyCorruption();\n  \
      \      UpdateUnstableAffliction();\n        CheckAndUpdateDoTs();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI update cycle and should be
    called regularly to maintain proper affliction state management. The implementation
    may involve checking for target validity, spell cooldowns, and aura durations.
    It's important that this method doesn't block or perform heavy computations as
    it's likely called frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that all target references are valid before attempting to apply
    affliction effects. Calling this method without proper combat state checks could
    lead to invalid spell applications or crashes. The method may indirectly affect
    combat performance if not properly optimized.
