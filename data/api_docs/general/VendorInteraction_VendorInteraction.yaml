documentation:
  brief: Handles the interaction between a player and a vendor NPC to buy or sell
    items.
  description: The VendorInteraction method manages the core functionality of a player
    engaging with a vendor NPC in World of Warcraft. This method typically handles
    the opening of the vendor's item list, processing of item purchases, and handling
    of item sales back to the vendor. It integrates with the TrinityCore auction house
    system and inventory management to ensure proper transaction handling. The method
    may also validate player requirements such as reputation, faction standing, or
    quest completion before allowing interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vendor Interaction
    code: "void Player::InteractWithVendor()\n{\n    if (m_target && m_target->IsVendor())\n\
      \    {\n        VendorInteraction();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player right-clicks on a vendor NPC.
    It relies on proper target validation and may trigger additional events such as
    quest updates or reputation changes depending on the vendor type and player state.
  warnings: Ensure that the target is properly validated as a vendor before calling
    this method to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes in the game client. Improper
    handling of item transactions can lead to inventory desynchronization.
