  signature: bool RestStrategy::IsResting(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot is currently in a resting state.
  description: The IsResting method checks if the specified bot AI instance is currently
    in a resting state. This typically occurs when the bot is sitting, sleeping, or
    otherwise not actively engaged in movement or combat activities. The method evaluates
    the bot's current behavior and state to determine if it qualifies as resting.
    It is commonly used by other AI components to make decisions about when to resume
    activity or perform actions that require the bot to be awake and alert.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot is currently resting (sitting, sleeping, or inactive),
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot is resting
    code: "if (restStrategy.IsResting(ai)) {\n    // Bot is resting, perform rest-related\
      \ actions\n    ai->TellMaster(\"I am currently resting.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsResting to conditionally resume activity
    code: "if (!restStrategy.IsResting(ai)) {\n    // Bot is not resting, so we can\
      \ resume normal activities\n    ai->SetState(BotState::MOVING);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Bot is resting, wait until it wakes up\n    ai->SetState(BotState::IDLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of the bot AI. The implementation
    may consider factors such as the bot's current animation state, position, and
    activity flags to determine if it is resting. It's important to note that this
    check should be performed regularly in the AI update loop for accurate results.
  warnings: The method does not account for all possible states that might be considered
    'resting' by players or game mechanics. It only evaluates the bot's internal state
    as tracked by the TrinityCore AI system, which may differ from player perception
    of resting states.
