documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GroupInterruptData object with default values
  description: The GroupInterruptData constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupInterruptData class, setting up internal data structures and default state
    values. This method is typically called when creating a new group interrupt tracking
    object to monitor and manage interrupt events within a player group context. The
    constructor ensures that all member variables are properly initialized to their
    default states, preventing undefined behavior when the object is subsequently
    used in group-based interrupt handling systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GroupInterruptData instance
    code: 'GroupInterruptData interruptData;

      // The interruptData object is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when a GroupInterruptData object
    is instantiated. It performs no complex initialization logic but ensures all internal
    state variables are set to known default values. The object should not be used
    until this constructor has completed successfully.
