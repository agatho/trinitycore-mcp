  method: EndNow
  signature: void Battleground::EndNow()
documentation:
  brief: Immediately ends the battleground, forcing all players to leave and resetting
    the arena state.
  description: The EndNow method is used to immediately terminate a battleground instance,
    bypassing any normal win conditions or timers. This method will instantly close
    the battleground, remove all players from the arena, and reset the battleground's
    state to allow for a new match to begin. It is typically called when an administrator
    wishes to forcefully end a game, when a server maintenance event occurs, or in
    response to certain game-breaking situations that require immediate intervention.
    The method ensures that all players are teleported out of the battleground area
    and their battleground-related data is properly cleaned up.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Forcefully ending a battleground
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->EndNow();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used sparingly as it interrupts the normal flow of
    gameplay. It is not intended for regular game mechanics but rather for administrative
    or emergency situations. The method will trigger appropriate cleanup routines
    and notify all players in the battleground about its termination.
  warnings: Using EndNow() abruptly terminates the battleground without allowing players
    to properly finish their match, which may lead to unexpected behavior or player
    dissatisfaction. It should only be used when absolutely necessary, such as during
    server maintenance or when a battleground is stuck in an invalid state.
