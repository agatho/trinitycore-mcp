  class: GameObjectInRangeCheck
  method: GameObjectInRangeCheck
  signature: void GameObjectInRangeCheck::GameObjectInRangeCheck(float _x, float _y,
    float _z, float _range, int _entry)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GameObjectInRangeCheck object with specified coordinates, range,
    and entry ID for use in game object filtering.
  description: The GameObjectInRangeCheck constructor initializes an object used to
    check whether a game object is within a specified range from a given location.
    This class is typically used in TrinityCore's AI and event systems to filter game
    objects based on proximity and type. The initialization sets up internal parameters
    including the center coordinates (x, y, z), maximum detection range, and optional
    entry ID for specific object filtering. This check is commonly employed in creature
    AI behaviors, quest triggers, and area-triggered events where proximity-based
    logic is required.
  parameters:
  - name: _x
    description: The X coordinate of the center point for range checking
  - name: _y
    description: The Y coordinate of the center point for range checking
  - name: _z
    description: The Z coordinate of the center point for range checking
  - name: _range
    description: Maximum distance from the center point to consider objects as in-range
  - name: _entry
    description: Optional game object entry ID to filter specific types of objects
      (0 means all entries)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObjectInRangeCheck Initialization
    code: GameObjectInRangeCheck check(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 50.0f, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Specific GameObject Type Filtering
    code: GameObjectInRangeCheck check(1000.0f, 2000.0f, 3000.0f, 25.0f, 12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically used in conjunction with other TrinityCore filtering
    mechanisms and may be part of larger AI or event handling systems. The range parameter
    uses the same coordinate system as the game world, so units are in world coordinates.
    Performance considerations should be noted when using this check in frequently
    called functions.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided coordinates are valid world coordinates to avoid
    unexpected behavior. When using a specific entry ID, verify that it corresponds
    to an actual game object in the database to prevent unnecessary filtering overhead.
