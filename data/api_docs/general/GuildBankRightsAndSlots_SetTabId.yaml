api:
  class: GuildBankRightsAndSlots
  method: SetTabId
  signature: void GuildBankRightsAndSlots::SetTabId(uint8 _tabId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the tab ID for the guild bank rights and slots configuration.
  description: The SetTabId method assigns a specific tab identifier to the GuildBankRightsAndSlots
    object, which determines which tab in the guild bank interface this configuration
    applies to. This method is typically used when managing access permissions and
    slot configurations for different tabs within a guild's bank system. The tab ID
    corresponds to the index of the tab in the guild bank UI, where 0 represents the
    first tab. This method does not perform any validation on the provided tab ID,
    so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the value is within valid
    bounds for the current guild bank configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: _tabId
    description: The tab identifier to assign to this guild bank rights and slots
      configuration. This value should correspond to a valid tab index in the guild
      bank interface, typically ranging from 0 to the maximum number of tabs minus
      one.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Tab ID for Guild Bank Rights
    code: 'GuildBankRightsAndSlots rightsAndSlots;

      rightsAndSlots.SetTabId(2);

      // This configures the rights and slots for the third tab (index 2) in the guild
      bank.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild bank management system in TrinityCore.
    It's primarily used by the core game logic when initializing or updating guild
    bank configurations, rather than being directly called from external modules.
    The tab ID should be validated before calling this method to ensure it doesn't
    exceed the maximum allowed tab count for the guild bank.
  warnings: Calling SetTabId with an invalid tab ID (e.g., greater than the number
    of tabs in the guild bank) may lead to undefined behavior or access violations
    within the game's internal data structures. Always validate the tab ID against
    the current guild bank configuration before invoking this method.
