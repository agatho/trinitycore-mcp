  class: Map
  method: SetSpawnGroupActive
  signature: void Map::SetSpawnGroupActive(uint32 groupId, bool state)
documentation:
  brief: Activates or deactivates a spawn group on the map.
  description: The SetSpawnGroupActive method enables or disables a specific spawn
    group within the map, controlling whether creatures and game objects belonging
    to that group will be spawned or despawned. This functionality is crucial for
    managing dynamic content such as event-based spawns, instance-specific mob groups,
    or conditional spawning logic. The method directly affects the map's internal
    spawn group state without requiring a full map reload. When a spawn group is deactivated,
    existing creatures and game objects from that group will be despawned if they
    are not otherwise controlled by other systems.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the spawn group to activate or deactivate.
      This ID must correspond to a valid spawn group defined in the database or loaded
      at runtime.
  - name: state
    description: Boolean flag indicating the desired state of the spawn group. If
      true, the group will be activated and its members may spawn; if false, the group
      will be deactivated and its members will despawn.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate a Spawn Group
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      map->SetSpawnGroupActive(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate a Spawn Group During Event
    code: 'Map* map = ...;

      // Deactivate spawn group when event ends

      map->SetSpawnGroupActive(eventSpawnGroupId, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the map's internal spawn group tracking system. It
    does not immediately spawn or despawn entities; it only changes the activation
    state which will be processed during the next update cycle. The method is typically
    called from game logic, event handlers, or instance management code.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid groupId may result in undefined behavior
    or errors. Ensure that the group ID exists and has been properly loaded before
    calling this function. Incorrect usage can lead to inconsistent spawn states or
    missing entities during gameplay.
