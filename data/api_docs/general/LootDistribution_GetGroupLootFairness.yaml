  class: LootDistribution
  method: GetGroupLootFairness
  signature: LootFairnessTracker LootDistribution::GetGroupLootFairness(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the loot fairness tracker for a specified group in the loot distribution
    system.
  description: The GetGroupLootFairness method returns a LootFairnessTracker object
    that contains information about how loot is distributed fairly among group members.
    This tracker maintains data related to loot allocation patterns, ensuring that
    items are distributed according to predefined fairness rules such as need/greed
    mechanics and loot rolling systems. The method operates within the context of
    TrinityCore's loot distribution framework where group-based loot management is
    essential for maintaining game balance and player satisfaction. It does not modify
    any internal state but provides read-only access to current fairness metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LootFairnessTracker object containing current fairness data for the specified
    group, including statistics on loot distribution patterns and adherence to fairness
    rules.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve fairness tracker for group
    code: 'LootFairnessTracker fairness = lootDistribution->GetGroupLootFairness(12345);

      // Use fairness data to analyze loot distribution

      uint32 totalItems = fairness.GetTotalDistributedItems();

      float averageRoll = fairness.GetAverageRollValue();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for debugging and monitoring purposes in the
    loot distribution system. The returned LootFairnessTracker object should not be
    modified directly as it represents a snapshot of current distribution metrics.
    Performance-wise, this method is lightweight as it only retrieves existing data
    without performing complex calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId parameter corresponds to an active group in the
    current instance. Accessing fairness data for non-existent or inactive groups
    may result in undefined behavior or invalid tracker states.
