  class: MoveSpline
  method: timeRemaining
  signature: int32 MoveSpline::timeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the remaining time in milliseconds for a spline movement
    to complete.
  description: The timeRemaining method computes the duration, in milliseconds, that
    remains for a character's spline-based movement to finish. This is typically used
    in conjunction with movement interpolation and animation systems within TrinityCore's
    AI and movement handling framework. The value returned represents the estimated
    time until the movement path is fully traversed, which can be useful for synchronization,
    timing events, or determining when a character has finished moving. This method
    assumes that the spline is actively playing and that the movement state is valid.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the remaining time in milliseconds until the
    spline movement completes. A return value of zero indicates that the movement
    has already completed or is not active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Remaining Movement Time
    code: "if (player->GetMoveSpline()->timeRemaining() > 0)\n{\n    // Character\
      \ is still moving\n    uint32 remainingTime = player->GetMoveSpline()->timeRemaining();\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Movement will complete in %u ms\", remainingTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spline timing calculations and should only
    be called when the spline is actively playing. It may not reflect real-time changes
    if the movement is interrupted or modified externally.
