  signature: void BotSession::ProcessBotPackets()
documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming bot packets for the session, handling communication between
    the game client and bot management system.
  description: The ProcessBotPackets method is responsible for handling and processing
    all incoming network packets that are specific to bot operations within a BotSession.
    This method typically iterates through queued bot-related messages, decodes their
    contents, and executes appropriate actions based on packet type. It serves as
    the core handler for maintaining bot state synchronization, processing commands
    sent from the game client, and managing the flow of data between the TrinityCore
    server and external bot clients. The method ensures that all bot-related network
    communication is properly handled within the context of a specific session.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic packet processing invocation
    code: "void MyBotSystem::Update()\n{\n    if (botSession)\n    {\n        botSession->ProcessBotPackets();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the session's update cycle to ensure
    timely processing of incoming bot packets. It may involve locking mechanisms or
    thread synchronization depending on how the session handles concurrent access.
    The method assumes that the session has valid packet data queued for processing.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper session initialization or when no packets
    are available may result in unnecessary overhead or potential null pointer exceptions
    if not properly guarded. Ensure that the BotSession is in a valid state before
    invoking this method.
