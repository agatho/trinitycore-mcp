api:
  class: CategoryCooldownMod
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CategoryCooldownMod::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes category cooldown modification data to a byte buffer for transmission
    to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the category cooldown modification
    data into a ByteBuffer format, preparing it for network transmission to a specific
    player. This method is typically used when sending initial state information about
    cooldown categories to a client, ensuring that the player's cooldown timers and
    category-based cooldown adjustments are properly synchronized. The method takes
    into account both the owner of the cooldown data and the receiving player, which
    may affect how the data is formatted or filtered based on visibility rules. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining accurate cooldown state information
    in World of Warcraft's combat system, particularly when dealing with abilities
    that share cooldown categories across different spells or items.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized category cooldown
      modification data will be written. This buffer is typically used for constructing
      network packets.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that owns the cooldown data. This determines
      the source of the cooldown information and may influence how the data is processed
      or filtered.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the cooldown data.
      This parameter affects visibility and filtering logic for the transmitted information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in cooldown synchronization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = player1;

      Player* receiver = player2;

      cooldownMod.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s client

      receiver->SendDirectMessage(&data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system and
    should be called during network packet construction for cooldown-related updates.
    The implementation likely handles compression or optimization of cooldown data
    to reduce bandwidth usage. Developers should ensure that both owner and receiver
    parameters are valid player objects before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for owner or receiver may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of player objects before
    invoking WriteCreate. This method modifies the provided ByteBuffer, so make sure
    it's properly initialized and cleared before use.
