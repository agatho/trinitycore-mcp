  brief: Removes excess bot instances from the game world based on configured limits
  description: The DespawnExcessBots method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    any bot instances that exceed the maximum allowed count per player or global limit.
    This method ensures that the server maintains optimal performance by preventing
    an excessive number of bots from being active simultaneously. It typically runs
    as part of a periodic cleanup routine or in response to configuration changes.
    The method iterates through existing bot instances and despawns those that are
    no longer needed according to the current spawner settings.

    than being called manually.
