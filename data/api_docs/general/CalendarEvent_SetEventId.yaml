documentation:
  brief: Sets the unique identifier for a calendar event
  description: The SetEventId method assigns a unique 64-bit identifier to a calendar
    event object. This identifier is used internally by the TrinityCore server to
    track and reference specific calendar events across different systems such as
    player invitations, event scheduling, and guild communications. The method directly
    modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent instance, ensuring that subsequent
    operations on the event use this ID for database persistence and network synchronization.
    This method should typically be called during event creation or initialization,
    before the event is added to any calendar systems.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier for
      the calendar event. This value must be globally unique across all calendar events
      in the server instance and should typically be generated using a proper ID generation
      mechanism or obtained from the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Event ID During Creation
    code: 'CalendarEvent event;

      uint64 newEventId = sObjectMgr->GenerateCalendarEventId();

      event.SetEventId(newEventId);

      // Event is now ready to be saved to database'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Existing Event ID
    code: "CalendarEvent* existingEvent = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (existingEvent)\n\
      {\n    uint64 newId = sObjectMgr->GenerateCalendarEventId();\n    existingEvent->SetEventId(newId);\n\
      \    // Update database with new ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct assignment without validation of the eventId
    value. It's recommended to use sObjectMgr->GenerateCalendarEventId() or similar
    mechanisms to ensure uniqueness. The CalendarEvent class likely uses this ID for
    database primary key operations and network packet serialization.
  warnings: Calling SetEventId on an event that has already been registered with the
    calendar system may cause inconsistencies in event tracking. Always ensure proper
    synchronization when modifying event IDs after events have been published or invited
    to players.
