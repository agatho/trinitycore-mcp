documentation:
  brief: Returns the player ID of the demon creator
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier of the player who created
    a demon. It is typically used in the context of summoned creatures or pets, particularly
    those that are controlled by players. The method returns an integer value representing
    the GUID of the player who owns the demon, which can be useful for determining
    ownership and tracking player-controlled summons. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining proper game mechanics related to player summoning and control.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the player who created the
    demon. If no creator exists or the demon was not created by a player, this value
    may be zero or null, indicating that the demon is not player-controlled.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nint creatorID = unit->GetDemonCreatorPlayer();\n\
      if (creatorID > 0)\n{\n    // Demon was created by a player\n    // Do something\
      \ with the creatorID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Demon was not created by a player\n\
      \    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that deal
    with summoned creatures or pets. It's important to note that the returned value
    may be zero if the demon was not created by a player, which could indicate either
    a non-player controlled summon or an invalid state.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can lead to invalid memory access
    if the unit is not properly initialized or if the demon has no creator. Also,
    ensure that the returned value is checked before use to avoid potential errors
    in logic.
