  method: RemoveFromNewQueue
  signature: void LFGQueue::RemoveFromNewQueue(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the LFG new queue based on their GUID.
  description: The RemoveFromNewQueue method removes a specific player, identified
    by their globally unique identifier (GUID), from the Looking For Group (LFG) new
    queue system. This function is typically invoked when a player's LFG status changes,
    such as when they join a group, leave the queue, or are removed due to timeout
    or other conditions. The method ensures that the player is no longer considered
    for new LFG matches and updates internal queue structures accordingly. It operates
    within the TrinityCore's LFG framework which manages player matchmaking for dungeons,
    raids, and other group content.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the player to be removed from the
      new LFG queue. This value uniquely identifies the player within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LFGQueue* lfgQueue = sLFGMgr->GetQueue();

      uint64 playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      lfgQueue->RemoveFromNewQueue(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called when a player's
    queue status needs to be updated. It does not perform any validation on the GUID,
    so calling it with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in undefined behavior
    or internal errors.
