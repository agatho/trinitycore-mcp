documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the rogue is positioned behind the target for stealth
    mechanics.
  description: The IsBehindTarget method evaluates the positional relationship between
    the rogue and their target to determine if the rogue is located behind the target.
    This is a core mechanic for stealth-based abilities in the Subtlety Rogue class,
    particularly relevant for abilities that require the rogue to be in a behind-position
    to function optimally or deal increased damage. The method likely uses angle calculations
    or positional vectors to compare the rogue's orientation relative to the target's
    facing direction. It returns true when the rogue is considered to be behind the
    target from a game mechanics perspective, which may affect ability usage, damage
    multipliers, or stealth effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the rogue is positioned behind the target, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates whether the positional condition for stealth-based
    abilities is met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (rogue->IsBehindTarget(targetGuid)) {\n    // Apply stealth bonus or\
      \ use backstab\n    rogue->CastSpell(target, BACKSTAB_SPELL);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Move to position behind target\n    rogue->MoveToPositionBehind(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other positioning checks and
    may be part of a larger stealth detection system. The implementation probably
    involves vector mathematics or angle calculations between the rogue's position
    and the target's facing direction to determine positional relationship.
  warnings: The method assumes valid target data exists and may throw errors or return
    undefined behavior if the target is invalid or not properly initialized. It should
    only be called when both the rogue and target are in a valid combat state.
