documentation:
  brief: Constructs a new CombatEventBus instance as a copy of an existing CombatEventBus
    object
  description: The CombatEventBus constructor is a copy constructor that creates a
    new CombatEventBus instance by copying all data and state from an existing CombatEventBus
    object. This constructor is typically used when creating new instances of combat
    event handling systems that need to maintain the same event subscriptions, handlers,
    and configuration as an existing bus. In the context of TrinityCore's World of
    Warcraft server architecture, this allows for proper duplication of combat-related
    event processing pipelines without requiring manual reconfiguration of event listeners
    or handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing CombatEventBus object to be copied. This parameter represents
      the source instance from which all properties, event subscriptions, and handler
      configurations will be duplicated to create the new instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an Existing CombatEventBus Instance
    code: 'CombatEventBus originalBus;

      // Configure originalBus with event handlers...

      CombatEventBus newBus(originalBus); // Copy constructor usage

      // newBus now contains all the same event handlers as originalBus'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Copy Constructor in Combat System Initialization
    code: "class CombatSystem {\nprivate:\n    CombatEventBus eventBus;\npublic:\n\
      \    CombatSystem() : eventBus() {}\n    \n    CombatEventBus createCombatBus()\
      \ {\n        return CombatEventBus(eventBus); // Return a copy of the system's\
      \ event bus\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs a shallow copy by default, meaning that any pointers
    or references within the CombatEventBus will be duplicated rather than deep-copied.
    If the class implements custom copying behavior for its internal data structures,
    those semantics should be considered when using this constructor.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this copy constructor with CombatEventBus instances
    that contain event handlers or subscriptions that may have side effects. The copied
    instance will share the same subscription state as the original, which might lead
    to unexpected behavior if both instances are used concurrently.
