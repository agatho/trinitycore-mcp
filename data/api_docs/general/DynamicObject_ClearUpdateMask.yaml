  class: DynamicObject
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void DynamicObject::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask of the dynamic object, optionally removing it from
    updates.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method resets the internal update mask of a DynamicObject
    instance. This operation is typically used during object destruction or when the
    object's state needs to be fully reset for repurposing. When the 'remove' parameter
    is true, the dynamic object is also removed from any active update lists or systems
    that track it. The method ensures that subsequent updates to this object will
    not include stale or invalid data. This functionality is essential in maintaining
    clean state management for temporary game entities like spell effects or area
    triggers.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: If true, the dynamic object is removed from update systems; if false,
      only the mask is cleared without removal.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to clear update mask
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;

      dynObj->ClearUpdateMask(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with removal from update systems
    code: 'DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;

      dynObj->ClearUpdateMask(true); // Removes object from all update queues'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying or reusing a DynamicObject
    instance to prevent memory leaks or invalid updates. It's commonly invoked in
    destructor implementations or when recycling objects from pools.
  warnings: Calling this method on an object that is still actively referenced by
    update systems may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the object
    is no longer in use before calling ClearUpdateMask with remove=true.
