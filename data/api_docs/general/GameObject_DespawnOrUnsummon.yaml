  signature: void GameObject::DespawnOrUnsummon(int delay, int forceRespawnTime)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a game object from the world, optionally scheduling its respawn.
  description: The DespawnOrUnsummon method removes a GameObject from the world environment.
    If a delay is specified, the object will be removed after that duration and may
    be scheduled for respawn based on its respawn time settings. This method is commonly
    used to temporarily hide or remove interactive objects such as doors, chests,
    or quest items. The forceRespawnTime parameter allows overriding the default respawn
    behavior when the object should reappear. When called without parameters, it immediately
    removes the GameObject from the world.
  parameters:
  - name: delay
    description: Delay in milliseconds before despawning the GameObject. If zero or
      negative, the object is removed immediately.
  - name: forceRespawnTime
    description: Optional override for respawn time in seconds. If non-zero, forces
      the object to respawn after this duration regardless of its default settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Immediate Despawn
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->DespawnOrUnsummon(); // Removes immediately'
    language: cpp
  - title: Delayed Despawn with Forced Respawn
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->DespawnOrUnsummon(5000, 30); // Remove after 5s, respawn in 30s'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the GameObject's internal state and affects its visibility
    in the world. It does not directly interact with database persistence; the object
    may still exist in the database but will be removed from active gameplay entities.
    The delay parameter allows for timed removals, useful for quest triggers or temporary
    environmental changes.
  warnings: Calling this method on a GameObject that is already despawned or destroyed
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the GameObject pointer remains valid
    before calling this method. Be cautious with forceRespawnTime as it may interfere
    with normal respawn logic if not used carefully.
