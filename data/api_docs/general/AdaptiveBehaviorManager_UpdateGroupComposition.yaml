  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::UpdateGroupComposition()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the group composition for adaptive behavior management.
  description: The UpdateGroupComposition method is responsible for recalculating
    and synchronizing the current group's composition within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    This includes updating member roles, class distributions, and other relevant group
    attributes that influence AI decision-making. The method ensures that the adaptive
    behavior system has accurate information about the group's makeup to make appropriate
    tactical decisions during encounters. It typically gets invoked when group members
    join or leave, or when significant changes occur in the group's configuration.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayerByGUID(playerGuid)->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->UpdateGroupComposition();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger additional internal updates to AI behaviors based
    on the new group composition. It's recommended to call this method after any significant
    group changes to ensure optimal adaptive behavior performance.
