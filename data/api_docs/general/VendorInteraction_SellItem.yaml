api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: SellItem
  signature: InteractionResult VendorInteraction::SellItem(Player * bot, Creature
    * vendor, int itemGuid, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Sells an item from the bot's inventory to a vendor and returns the interaction
    result.
  description: The SellItem method facilitates the sale of an item owned by the player
    bot to a creature vendor within the game world. It handles the transaction logic,
    including removing the item from the bot's inventory, calculating the sell value,
    and updating the bot's money. The method ensures that the item being sold is valid,
    the vendor accepts the item type, and sufficient quantity exists in the bot's
    inventory. This method is typically used in automated trading or NPC interaction
    scripts within TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will sell
      the item. Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: vendor
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the vendor to whom the
      item is being sold. Must be a valid vendor creature with a valid vendor template.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item in the bot's inventory that
      is to be sold. Must correspond to an existing item in the player's inventory.
  - name: count
    description: The number of items to sell from the stack. Must be a positive integer
      and not exceed the quantity of the item available in the bot's inventory.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the success or failure of
    the selling operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAIL, INVALID_ITEM, INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS,
    or VENDOR_NOT_FOUND depending on the outcome of the transaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Selling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nint itemGuid = 12345;\nuint32\
      \ count = 1;\nInteractionResult result = VendorInteraction::SellItem(bot, vendor,\
      \ itemGuid, count);\nif (result == SUCCESS) {\n    // Item sold successfully\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Selling Multiple Items
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nCreature* vendor = ...;\nint itemGuid = 12345;\nuint32\
      \ count = 10;\nInteractionResult result = VendorInteraction::SellItem(bot, vendor,\
      \ itemGuid, count);\nif (result == SUCCESS) {\n    // Sold 10 items successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and vendor are within valid interaction
    range and that the vendor has a valid sellable item list. The method does not
    perform any checks for item durability or quality, as these are handled separately
    in the core game logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemGuid corresponds to an actual item in the bot's inventory;
    otherwise, the method may fail with INVALID_ITEM. Also, be aware that selling
    items may trigger vendor-specific restrictions or quest conditions that could
    affect the outcome.
