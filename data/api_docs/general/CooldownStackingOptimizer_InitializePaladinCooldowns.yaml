  method: InitializePaladinCooldowns
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::InitializePaladinCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes paladin-specific cooldowns for the cooldown stacking optimizer.
  description: The InitializePaladinCooldowns method sets up and configures all relevant
    cooldowns specific to paladin class abilities within the cooldown stacking optimization
    framework. This includes initializing cooldown timers, setting up ability priorities,
    and preparing the cooldown tracking system for paladin-specific mechanics such
    as Divine Shield, Lay on Hands, and other key abilities. The method ensures that
    the optimizer has accurate data about paladin cooldowns before any optimization
    calculations are performed, making it essential for proper cooldown management
    during combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializePaladinCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a paladin's
    cooldown optimization system. It assumes that the paladin class data and ability
    information are already loaded into memory. The method does not perform any validation
    checks on existing cooldown states, so it should only be called when the optimizer
    is in a clean state.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate cooldown entries or incorrect optimization calculations. Ensure that
    this method is only invoked once per paladin instance to avoid unexpected behavior
    in cooldown management.
