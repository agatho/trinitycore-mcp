documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available energy combo points for the player
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the number of energy combo points
    currently available for use by the player character. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, this value represents the count of combo points that can be spent
    on abilities or attacks. The returned value typically ranges from 0 to 5, corresponding
    to the maximum number of combo points a player can accumulate. This method is
    commonly used in combat-related systems to determine how many combo points are
    available for spending on combo-based abilities such as Rupture, Eviscerate, or
    other finishers that require combo points to function.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of available energy combo points.
    This value is typically between 0 and 5, where 0 indicates no combo points are
    available and 5 represents the maximum possible combo points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check available combo points
    code: "uint32 comboPoints = player->GetEnergyComboResource()->GetAvailable();\n\
      if (comboPoints > 0)\n{\n    // Player has combo points available for use\n\
      \    // Proceed with combo-based ability execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using combo points in a combat logic check
    code: "EnergyComboResource* comboResource = player->GetEnergyComboResource();\n\
      uint32 availablePoints = comboResource->GetAvailable();\n\n// Check if we can\
      \ use an ability that requires 3 combo points\nif (availablePoints >= 3)\n{\n\
      \    // Execute combo-based ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EVISERATE,\
      \ true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Cannot execute combo-based ability, fallback to\
      \ regular attack\n    player->Attack(target, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the energy-based combo resource system used in certain
    classes like Rogues and Assassins. The returned value reflects the current state
    of the player's combo point accumulation and may be modified by various game events
    such as successful attacks, ability usage, or resource regeneration mechanics.
