  signature: uint32 InstanceScript::GetEntranceLocation() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entrance location identifier for the instance.
  description: The GetEntranceLocation method returns a unique identifier representing
    the entrance point of the current instance. This value is typically used by the
    game engine to determine where players should be teleported when entering the
    instance or when resetting the instance. The returned value corresponds to a specific
    location defined in the instance's configuration and may be used in conjunction
    with other methods like SetEntranceLocation or GetBossState to manage instance
    flow and player positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the entrance location identifier for this instance.
    This value is typically an index or GUID that maps to a specific teleport location
    within the instance's map data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnPlayerEnter(Player*\
      \ player) override\n    {\n        uint32 entranceId = GetEntranceLocation();\n\
      \        // Use entranceId to determine where to teleport the player\n     \
      \   if (entranceId)\n        {\n            // Perform teleport logic\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance initialization or player
    entry events. The returned value should be treated as a read-only identifier and
    not modified directly. The implementation relies on the instance script's internal
    state and may return zero if no valid entrance location has been set.
