  signature: bool Unit::IsInFeralForm() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently in feral form.
  description: This method checks if the unit is in a feral form state, which typically
    applies to druids and other classes that can enter combat states. The method returns
    true when the unit's current form matches the feral form, indicating that the
    unit is actively in a feral state rather than other forms like stealth or normal
    form. This is commonly used in game mechanics for determining if a unit is currently
    in a combat state that requires specific handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is in feral form, false otherwise. The method
    essentially checks whether the unit's current form matches the feral form state,
    which is typically associated with druids entering combat mode.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsInFeralForm()) {\n    // Handle feral form logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other form-related checks
    and should be used carefully when determining combat states. The implementation
    relies on checking the unit's current form state against predefined feral form
    constants.
  warnings: This method may not work as expected if used in combination with other
    form-checking methods, since different classes might have different definitions
    of 'feral form'. Care should be taken to ensure that this method is used only
    when appropriate for the class being checked.
