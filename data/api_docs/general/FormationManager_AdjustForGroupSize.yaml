  signature: void FormationManager::AdjustForGroupSize()
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts formation positioning based on current group size and member count
  description: The AdjustForGroupSize method dynamically modifies the positioning
    and spacing of units within a formation to accommodate changes in group composition.
    This method is typically invoked when group members join or leave, ensuring that
    formations maintain optimal spacing and alignment regardless of the number of
    participants. It recalculates relative positions of all formation members based
    on the current group size, adjusting for factors such as unit size, movement patterns,
    and tactical positioning requirements. The method operates within the context
    of World of Warcraft's group mechanics, particularly affecting player and NPC
    formations during group activities like raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Formation
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::OnMemberJoin()\n{\n    formationManager.AdjustForGroupSize();\n\
      \    // Formation is now adjusted for new group size\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal recalculation of formation offsets and
    may affect unit AI behavior. It should be called after any significant change
    to group membership to maintain proper tactical positioning.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper group state management may result in
    incorrect positioning or formation disruption. Ensure that the group's current
    size is accurately reflected before invocation.
