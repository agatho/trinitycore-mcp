  class: TradeManager
  method: TradeManager
  signature: void TradeManager::TradeManager(Player * bot, int * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes trade management for a player bot with AI configuration.
  description: The TradeManager constructor initializes the trade management system
    for a specified player bot, setting up internal state and configurations based
    on the provided AI parameters. This method is typically used in AI-driven trading
    systems within TrinityCore to manage automated trading behaviors for NPC or bot
    characters. It prepares the trade manager to handle transactions, item evaluations,
    and trade negotiations according to the AI's decision-making framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      trade management functionality. Must not be null.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing AI configuration parameters.
      The exact structure and meaning of these parameters depend on the specific AI
      implementation being used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic TradeManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized player object

      int aiConfig[] = {1, 2, 3};

      TradeManager manager;

      manager.TradeManager(bot, aiConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after ensuring that the Player object is
    valid and properly initialized. The AI parameter array must contain sufficient
    elements for the trade manager to configure its behavior correctly.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for either 'bot' or 'ai' will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper initialization of all parameters
    before calling this method.
