  method: ~BotAIInitializer
  signature: void BotAIInitializer::~BotAIInitializer()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotAIInitializer instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotAIInitializer class is responsible for releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were acquired during the initialization
    of bot AI components. This method ensures proper cleanup of internal data structures,
    prevents memory leaks, and maintains system stability when a BotAIInitializer
    object goes out of scope. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this destructor
    plays a crucial role in managing AI behavior for player-controlled bots, ensuring
    that each bot's AI state is properly terminated without leaving dangling references
    or corrupted memory.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotAIInitializer
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    BotAIInitializer initializer;\n    // ... use\
      \ initializer ...\n    // destructor called automatically when initializer goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, meaning it properly handles polymorphic destruction
    if BotAIInitializer is inherited from. The destructor should not be called directly
    unless explicitly needed for specific cleanup scenarios.
