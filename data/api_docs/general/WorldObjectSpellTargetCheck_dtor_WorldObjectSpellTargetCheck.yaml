documentation:
  brief: Destroys a WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method is automatically invoked when an instance of
    WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's spell system, this class likely serves as a predicate
    or functor to determine whether a given world object meets specific criteria for
    being a valid target for a spell effect. The destructor ensures proper cleanup
    of any internal state or data structures without requiring explicit user intervention.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck instance
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    WorldObjectSpellTargetCheck checker;\n    //\
      \ Use checker...\n    // Destructor called automatically when checker goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard C++ destructor and follows RAII (Resource Acquisition
    Is Initialization) principles. It should not be called directly unless explicitly
    managing object lifetime through raw pointers. The implementation likely handles
    cleanup of internal data structures but does not perform complex operations.
