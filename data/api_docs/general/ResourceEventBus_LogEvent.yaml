documentation:
  brief: Logs a resource event with associated action information to the event bus.
  description: The LogEvent method is used to record and dispatch resource-related
    events within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts a ResourceEvent object and
    an action string, which together provide context about the event that occurred.
    This method is typically invoked when a resource change occurs, such as a player
    gaining or losing gold, experience points, or other in-game currency. The event
    is then processed by the EventBus system for logging, monitoring, or triggering
    related game mechanics. The action parameter provides semantic meaning to the
    event, allowing systems to differentiate between various types of resource interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The ResourceEvent object containing details about the resource change
      that occurred. This includes information such as the type of resource, amount
      changed, and the entity involved.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action associated with the event. This could
      be 'gain', 'lose', 'spend', or other relevant terms that define the nature of
      the resource transaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Logging a gold gain event
    code: 'ResourceEvent event;

      event.type = ResourceType::GOLD;

      event.amount = 1000;

      ResourceEventBus::Instance()->LogEvent(event, "gain");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging an experience loss event
    code: 'ResourceEvent event;

      event.type = ResourceType::EXPERIENCE;

      event.amount = -500;

      ResourceEventBus::Instance()->LogEvent(event, "lose");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the resource management system and relies on the EventBus
    infrastructure. It's designed to be thread-safe for concurrent access by different
    subsystems. The event bus may filter or route events based on the action string,
    so consistent naming conventions are recommended.
  warnings: Ensure that ResourceEvent objects are properly initialized before passing
    them to this method. Passing uninitialized or invalid resource types may lead
    to undefined behavior in downstream systems.
