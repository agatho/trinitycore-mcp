  method: HasWarbandScene
  signature: bool CollectionMgr::HasWarbandScene(uint32 warbandSceneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified warband scene is available in the collection manager.
  description: The HasWarbandScene method determines whether a given warband scene
    ID exists within the collection manager's data structure. This functionality is
    typically used to verify the presence of specific warband-related content, such
    as visual scenes or cinematic sequences, before attempting to display or interact
    with them. The method performs a lookup operation against an internal collection
    of warband scenes and returns a boolean result indicating availability. It is
    commonly utilized in game logic where conditional rendering or activation of warband
    content depends on scene existence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified warband scene ID exists in the collection
    manager, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (collectionMgr->HasWarbandScene(12345)) {\n    // Warband scene with\
      \ ID 12345 is available\n    // Proceed with scene activation or display logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Scene Activation
    code: "uint32 sceneId = player->GetSelectedWarbandScene();\nif (collectionMgr->HasWarbandScene(sceneId))\
      \ {\n    player->PlayWarbandScene(sceneId);\n} else {\n    // Fallback or error\
      \ handling\n    sLog->outError(\"Warband scene %u not found in collection.\"\
      , sceneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a fast lookup operation using an internal data
    structure such as a hash map or set for efficient retrieval. It should be used
    sparingly in performance-critical sections of code due to potential overhead from
    collection traversal or database lookups if not cached.
  warnings: Ensure that the warband scene ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to actual content in the game's data files; invalid IDs may lead to unexpected
    behavior or false negatives. This method does not validate the scene's usability
    beyond mere existence.
