  brief: Destroys a TradeManager instance and cleans up associated trade data
  description: The TradeManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all resources associated with a trade session. When a player's trade window is
    closed or abandoned, this destructor ensures that any active trade data is properly
    released, pending offers are cleared, and the trade state is reset. This method
    handles cleanup of temporary trade objects, prevents memory leaks, and maintains
    the integrity of the trading system by ensuring no dangling references remain
    after a trade session ends.

  - title: Automatic destruction of TradeManager
    code: "void HandlePlayerTradeCleanup(Player* player)\n{\n    // TradeManager is\
      \ automatically destroyed when it goes out of scope\n    {\n        TradeManager\
      \ tradeMgr(player);\n        // ... perform trade operations ...\n    } // tradeMgr\
      \ destructor called here automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    a TradeManager object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important
    to note that this method should not be called directly in most cases, as it's
    meant to be invoked through normal object lifecycle management.
