documentation:
  brief: Decrements the count of the level bracket by one.
  description: The DecrementCount method reduces the internal counter associated with
    a LevelBracket instance by one unit. This method is typically used in game systems
    where level brackets track occurrences or usage counts, such as in loot distribution,
    quest progression, or player activity tracking. The operation is performed in-place
    and does not return any value. It is marked as const, indicating that it does
    not modify the object's state beyond the internal counter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decrementing a LevelBracket Counter
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket;

      bracket.DecrementCount(); // Reduces the internal count by one'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other bracket management
    functions. Since it's marked as const, it should not have side effects beyond
    modifying its internal counter, which may be subject to race conditions if accessed
    from multiple threads without synchronization.
