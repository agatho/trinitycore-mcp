    uint32 itemLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the sell price of an item based on its template, quality,
    and item level.
  description: The GetSellPrice method computes the sell price for an item using its
    ItemTemplate, quality, and item level parameters. This function is essential for
    determining how much an item will be sold to players in the game. The calculation
    involves considering various factors such as item quality, item level, and the
    base sell price from the template. It's commonly used during item creation, vendor
    transactions, or when calculating item value for auction house sales. The method
    ensures that items of different qualities and levels are priced appropriately
    based on game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: proto
    description: Pointer to the ItemTemplate structure containing base item information
      including sell price, item level, and other relevant properties. This determines
      the base sell price calculation.
  - name: quality
    description: The quality level of the item (0-7), where 0 represents poor quality
      and 7 represents artifact quality. Higher quality items typically have higher
      sell prices due to game mechanics.
  - name: itemLevel
    description: The item level of the item, which affects the sell price calculation.
      Higher item levels generally result in higher sell prices as they reflect better
      item stats and progression.
  returns: Represents the calculated sell price for the item in copper coins. Returns
    0 if no valid sell price can be determined based on the provided parameters, indicating
    that the item cannot be sold or has no value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 sellPrice = item->GetSellPrice(itemTemplate, quality, itemLevel);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "ItemTemplate* template = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32 sellPrice\
      \ = item->GetSellPrice(template, 4, 80);\nif (sellPrice > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ the sell price\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid sell price\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related functions
    for calculating item value. Performance considerations include checking for null
    pointers to ItemTemplate before calling this method, as it may cause crashes if
    not handled properly. Thread safety depends on the context of usage; when called
    from within a transaction or item creation process, it should be thread-safe.
  warnings: The method may return 0 if any of the parameters are invalid or missing,
    which could indicate an error in item creation or processing. Care should be taken
    to ensure that quality and itemLevel values fall within valid ranges (0-7 for
    quality, and appropriate item level range) to avoid incorrect pricing.
