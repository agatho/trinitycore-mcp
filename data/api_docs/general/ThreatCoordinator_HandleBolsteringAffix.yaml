  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::HandleBolsteringAffix()
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Bolstering affix effect to all players in the current threat
    coordinator's context.
  description: The HandleBolsteringAffix method implements the Bolstering dungeon
    affix behavior, which increases the health and damage of all players within the
    associated threat coordinator's scope. This method is typically invoked during
    dungeon encounters when the Bolstering affix is active. It modifies player statistics
    in real-time to reflect the increased difficulty and challenge presented by this
    affix. The implementation ensures that all affected players receive consistent
    stat boosts across their character's current combat abilities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnBolsteringAffixActive()\n{\n    threatCoordinator.HandleBolsteringAffix();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ThreatCoordinator has a valid reference to all
    players in its scope. The implementation may require synchronization if used in
    multi-threaded environments. Performance impact is minimal as it only modifies
    player stats without complex calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the Bolstering affix is actually
    active in the current dungeon instance. Calling it outside of proper context may
    lead to unexpected stat modifications for players.
