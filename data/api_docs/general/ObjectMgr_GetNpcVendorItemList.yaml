documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the vendor item list for a specified NPC entry.
  description: The GetNpcVendorItemList method fetches the list of items that a specific
    NPC (non-player character) is configured to sell. This method accesses internal
    data structures within the ObjectMgr class that store vendor information for creatures
    in the game world. It returns a pointer to an array of integers representing item
    IDs that the NPC will vend. The returned pointer is valid only during the lifetime
    of the ObjectMgr instance and should not be freed or modified by the caller. This
    method is typically used when processing vendor interactions, such as displaying
    available items to players or validating item purchases.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int* pointing to an array of integers representing item IDs that
    the NPC with the specified entry sells. The array may be empty if no items are
    configured for the vendor, and the pointer will be nullptr if the NPC entry is
    invalid or not found in the vendor data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through vendor items
    code: "uint32 npcEntry = 12345;\nconst int* itemList = sObjectMgr->GetNpcVendorItemList(npcEntry);\n\
      if (itemList != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; itemList[i] != 0; ++i)\n  \
      \  {\n        uint32 itemId = static_cast<uint32>(itemList[i]);\n        //\
      \ Process each item ID\n        printf(\"Item ID: %u\\n\", itemId);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses cached vendor data which is loaded during server startup
    or when creature templates are initialized. The returned array is null-terminated,
    with the final element being zero to indicate end of list. Be aware that modifying
    the returned pointer directly may corrupt internal data structures.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned memory. The pointer becomes
    invalid if the ObjectMgr instance is destroyed or reloaded. Ensure that the NPC
    entry exists in the database before calling this method, otherwise it may return
    nullptr.
