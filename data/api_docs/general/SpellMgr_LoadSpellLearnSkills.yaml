documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes spell learning skill data from database entries for
    use in player skill progression and spell acquisition mechanics.
  description: The LoadSpellLearnSkills method is responsible for loading spell learning
    skill information from the database into memory. This method processes entries
    that define which skills are learned through specific spells, typically used in
    conjunction with spell learning mechanics such as profession training or class-specific
    abilities. It populates internal data structures required for tracking spell-to-skill
    relationships and ensures that players can correctly acquire skills when learning
    spells. The method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload
    operations to ensure all spell learning skill mappings are available for runtime
    use.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellManager()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellLearnSkills();\n\
      \    // Spell learning skills are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during server startup or database reload operations.
    It's important to note that this method does not validate the integrity of the
    loaded data - it simply loads what's present in the database tables. The actual
    spell learning skill data should be properly maintained in the database with correct
    foreign key relationships.
  warnings: This method modifies internal spell manager state and should only be called
    during server initialization or when reloading database content. Calling this
    method during active gameplay may cause unexpected behavior or inconsistencies
    in player spell learning mechanics.
