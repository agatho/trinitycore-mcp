documentation:
  brief: Sends spell damage immune message to target unit
  description: This method sends a spell damage immune message to a target unit, indicating
    that the unit has been immune to a specific spell's damage. The method is used
    in conjunction with spell mechanics to prevent damage from being applied to the
    target. It typically occurs during spell processing when a unit is immune to certain
    types of damage or when a spell effect is applied to a target that has immunity
    to that particular spell.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The target unit that will receive the immune message. This parameter
      must be a valid Unit pointer and cannot be nullptr.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell that is being immune to. This value represents
      the specific spell being processed and must be a valid spell ID.
  - name: isPeriodic
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the spell damage is periodic or not.
      True indicates that the spell damage is periodic, false indicates it is non-periodic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      bool isPeriodic = false;

      unit->SendSpellDamageImmune(target, spellId, isPeriodic);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the target unit has immunity to a
    specific spell. It's typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    and requires proper handling of spell mechanics. The method does not directly
    apply damage but rather sends an immune message to the target.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell processing, potentially
    causing damage to be applied when it shouldn't be. Ensure that the target unit
    actually has immunity before calling this method.
