documentation:
  brief: Updates combat metrics for the warlock AI, tracking damage dealt and received
    during combat.
  description: The UpdateCombatMetrics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    combat-related statistics within the WarlockAI class. This includes tracking damage
    output, damage taken, critical hits, and other relevant combat data that influences
    AI decision-making. The method is typically called during combat updates to ensure
    accurate performance tracking and to inform strategic behavior adjustments. It
    plays a crucial role in enabling the warlock's AI to make informed decisions based
    on real-time combat metrics, such as when to use certain spells or abilities.
    This method does not require any specific preconditions but assumes that the AI
    is currently engaged in combat.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Metrics Update
    code: "void UpdateCombatMetrics()\n{\n    // Internal logic to update damage statistics\n\
      \    // This method is typically called by the AI system during combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked regularly during active combat to maintain
    accurate metrics. It may internally access or modify member variables related
    to combat statistics and should not be called outside of combat scenarios without
    proper safeguards.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat context might lead to inconsistent
    or inaccurate metric tracking. Ensure that the AI is properly initialized and
    in combat state before invoking this method.
