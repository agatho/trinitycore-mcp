  method: UpdatePainManagement
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdatePainManagement(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the pain management logic for a demon hunter AI, handling cooldowns
    and spell usage based on time differences.
  description: The UpdatePainManagement method is responsible for managing the demon
    hunter's pain management abilities within the AI system. It processes the time
    difference (diff) to determine when to activate or update pain-related spells
    such as Pain, which is a key resource management mechanic in the Demon Hunter
    class. This method typically handles cooldown tracking, spell casting decisions,
    and ensures proper timing of pain-based abilities during combat. The method is
    called regularly by the AI update loop to maintain active pain management strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate cooldown progress and determine when pain management
      abilities should be triggered or updated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdatePainManagement(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update cycle and should be called regularly
    to ensure proper pain management behavior. The diff parameter must be accurately
    calculated from the last update time to maintain correct cooldown tracking.
