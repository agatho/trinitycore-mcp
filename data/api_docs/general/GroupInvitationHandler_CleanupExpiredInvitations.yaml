  brief: Removes expired group invitations from the system
  description: The CleanupExpiredInvitations method is responsible for removing group
    invitations that have exceeded their valid time period. This method ensures that
    stale invitations do not remain in the system indefinitely, helping to maintain
    clean state and prevent potential issues with invitation handling. It typically
    runs periodically as part of the group management system's maintenance routines.
    The method operates on internal data structures containing invitation records
    and removes those whose expiration timestamps have passed.

  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the system's periodic cleanup
    routines. Developers should not need to invoke this method directly in normal
    gameplay scenarios, as it's designed to run automatically when needed.
