  class: PathOptimizer
  method: IsDirectPathValid
  signature: bool PathOptimizer::IsDirectPathValid(Map * map, const int & start, const
    int & end) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a direct path exists between two points in a given map.
  description: The IsDirectPathValid method evaluates if there is a valid, unobstructed
    straight-line path between two specified points within a given map. It is commonly
    used in pathfinding algorithms to quickly determine if a direct route can be taken
    without needing to compute a complex navigation mesh path. This method typically
    checks for obstacles such as walls, terrain features, or other environmental barriers
    that would prevent movement from the start point to the end point. The method
    returns true if a direct path is possible and false otherwise, making it an essential
    optimization tool in AI and movement systems.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the path validation occurs. This
      represents the game world map instance containing terrain and obstacle data.
  - name: start
    description: Integer identifier representing the starting point of the path. The
      exact meaning depends on the implementation but typically refers to a node index
      or coordinate value within the map's navigation system.
  - name: end
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination point of the path.
      Similar to start, this is usually a node index or coordinate value in the map's
      navigation system.
  returns: Returns true if a direct, unobstructed path exists between the start and
    end points; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check path validity
    code: "if (pathOptimizer.IsDirectPathValid(map, startPoint, endPoint)) {\n   \
      \ // Proceed with direct movement\n    printf(\"Direct path available\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Use alternative pathfinding method\n    printf(\"No direct\
      \ path available\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI decision making
    code: "void AI::Update() {\n    if (IsDirectPathValid(currentMap, GetPosition(),\
      \ targetPosition)) {\n        MoveDirectlyTo(targetPosition);\n    } else {\n\
      \        FindAlternativePath();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used as a performance optimization in pathfinding systems
    to avoid expensive computations when a direct route is possible. It may utilize
    spatial data structures or precomputed obstacle maps for efficient evaluation.
  warnings: The method assumes that the start and end points are valid indices within
    the map's navigation system. Invalid indices may lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Additionally, this method might not account for dynamic obstacles that
    appear during runtime.
