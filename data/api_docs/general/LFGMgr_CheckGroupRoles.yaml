  signature: bool LFGMgr::CheckGroupRoles(LfgRolesMap & groles)
documentation:
  brief: Validates and checks the role assignments within a Looking for Group (LFG)
    party.
  description: The CheckGroupRoles method evaluates whether the current group's role
    distribution is valid according to LFG rules. It ensures that each player in the
    group has been assigned a proper role (tank, healer, damage dealer) and that the
    group composition meets the requirements for the current LFG dungeon or activity.
    This method is typically called during group formation and before allowing players
    to join a dungeon to prevent invalid role configurations that could cause issues
    with quest progression or group matching.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all players in the group have valid roles assigned and
    the group composition meets LFG requirements; otherwise returns false if any player
    has an invalid role assignment or if the group does not satisfy the required role
    distribution for the current LFG activity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Validation Check
    code: "LfgRolesMap groupRoles;\n// Assume groupRoles is populated with player\
      \ roles\nbool isValid = sLFGMgr->CheckGroupRoles(groupRoles);\nif (!isValid)\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid role configuration\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid LFG\
      \ group roles detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    when validating group composition before allowing players to enter a dungeon.
    It does not modify the role assignments but rather verifies their correctness
    based on current LFG rules.
  warnings: Do not call this method with unpopulated or invalid LfgRolesMap structures
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that all player roles are properly
    initialized before invoking this check.
