  class: PositionUtils
  method: IsGroupTooSpread
  signature: bool PositionUtils::IsGroupTooSpread(const int & players, float maxDistance)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group of players is too spread out based on maximum
    allowed distance between members.
  description: The IsGroupTooSpread method evaluates if the spatial distribution of
    players in a group exceeds a specified maximum distance threshold. This utility
    function is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to enforce grouping
    mechanics, such as preventing players from straying too far apart during dungeon
    or raid encounters. It calculates the distances between all pairs of players and
    returns true if any pair exceeds the provided maxDistance parameter. The method
    assumes that player positions are available and properly initialized within the
    game world context.
  parameters:
  - name: players
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of players in the
      group to evaluate for spread.
  - name: maxDistance
    description: Float value specifying the maximum allowed distance between any two
      players in the group. If any pair of players exceeds this distance, the method
      returns true.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the group is considered too spread out.
    Returns true if any player pair exceeds maxDistance; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int playerCount = 5;\nfloat maxAllowedDistance = 30.0f;\nbool isTooSpread\
      \ = PositionUtils::IsGroupTooSpread(playerCount, maxAllowedDistance);\nif (isTooSpread)\n\
      {\n    // Handle group being too spread out\n    sLog->outString(\"Group is\
      \ too spread out!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "void CheckAndWarnGroupSpread(Group* group)\n{\n    if (!group) return;\n\
      \    \n    int playerCount = group->GetMembersCount();\n    float maxDistance\
      \ = 25.0f;\n    \n    if (PositionUtils::IsGroupTooSpread(playerCount, maxDistance))\n\
      \    {\n        // Send warning to all group members\n        for (Group::MemberSlotList::const_iterator\
      \ itr = group->GetMemberSlots().begin();\n             itr != group->GetMemberSlots().end();\
      \ ++itr)\n        {\n            Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(itr->guid);\n\
      \            if (player)\n                ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Warning: Group is too spread out!\");\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires that player positions are accurately tracked and accessible
    for proper distance calculations. Performance may be impacted when evaluating
    large groups due to O(n^2) complexity of pairwise distance checks. The method
    does not account for terrain or obstacles in distance calculations, relying purely
    on Euclidean distance.
  warnings: Ensure that the players parameter reflects the actual number of valid
    players in the group, as invalid counts can lead to incorrect results. Be cautious
    when using this function in performance-critical code paths due to its quadratic
    time complexity with respect to player count.
