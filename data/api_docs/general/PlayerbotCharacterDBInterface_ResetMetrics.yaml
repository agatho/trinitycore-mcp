documentation:
  brief: Resets all player bot metrics to their default values
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and resets all accumulated performance
    and behavioral metrics for player bots within the TrinityCore environment. This
    includes clearing statistics such as action counts, decision times, and other
    tracking data that may have been collected during bot operation. The method ensures
    a clean state for subsequent bot behavior analysis or testing scenarios. This
    function is typically invoked when resetting bot configurations or during system
    maintenance to ensure accurate metric reporting.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface dbInterface;

      dbInterface.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot system is not actively processing
    actions to prevent data corruption. The reset operation is atomic and ensures
    all internal metric counters are properly initialized to zero.
  warnings: Calling this method during active bot operations may result in inconsistent
    state tracking and inaccurate performance metrics. Always ensure the bot system
    is idle before invoking this function.
