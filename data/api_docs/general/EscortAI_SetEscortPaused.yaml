  class: EscortAI
  method: SetEscortPaused
  signature: void EscortAI::SetEscortPaused(bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Pauses or resumes the escort AI behavior for a creature.
  description: The SetEscortPaused method controls whether an EscortAI instance is
    actively managing the movement and behavior of a creature during an escort quest.
    When paused, the AI will halt all escort-related actions such as waypoint following,
    combat engagement, and quest progress updates. When resumed, the AI continues
    from its last state. This method is typically used to temporarily disable escort
    behavior during cutscenes, player interaction delays, or when the escort needs
    to be manually controlled.
  parameters:
  - name: 'on'
    description: Boolean value determining the pause state. If true, the escort AI
      will be paused; if false, it will resume normal operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Pause Escort During Cutscene
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    // Pause the escort during\
      \ a cutscene\n    if (EscortAI* escort = GetEscortAI())\n        escort->SetEscortPaused(true);\n\
      \    \n    // Perform cutscene logic here\n    \n    // Resume after cutscene\n\
      \    escort->SetEscortPaused(false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pause Based on Quest State
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayerForEscort())\n\
      \    {\n        // Pause escort when player is in a specific area\n        if\
      \ (player->GetPositionX() > 1000.0f)\n            SetEscortPaused(true);\n \
      \       else\n            SetEscortPaused(false);\n    }\n    \n    // Continue\
      \ with normal AI updates\n    EscortAI::UpdateAI(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal state machine of the EscortAI.
    It's important to ensure that any pause/resume logic doesn't create deadlocks
    or inconsistent states, especially when used in conjunction with other AI behaviors
    or quest events.
  warnings: Calling SetEscortPaused(true) while the escort is in combat may cause
    unexpected behavior if not properly handled. The method does not validate whether
    the creature is currently in a valid state for pausing, so it's recommended to
    check the current state before calling this method.
