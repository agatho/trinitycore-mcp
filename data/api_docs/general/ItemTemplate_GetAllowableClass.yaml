documentation:
  brief: Returns the allowable class mask for the item template.
  description: The GetAllowableClass method retrieves the bitmask that defines which
    player classes can use the item. This value is typically read from the database
    field 'allowableclass' in the item_template table. The returned value represents
    a bitfield where each bit corresponds to a specific class, allowing for multiple
    classes to be allowed simultaneously. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this bitmask is used during item validation and character equipment checks to
    ensure that only permitted classes can equip the item.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit signed integer representing the allowable class bitmask. Each
    bit corresponds to a specific player class (Warrior = 1, Paladin = 2, Hunter =
    4, Rogue = 8, Priest = 16, Death Knight = 32, Shaman = 64, Mage = 128, Warlock
    = 256, Druid = 512). A value of 0 indicates all classes are allowed.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific class can use an item
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nint32\
      \ allowableClass = itemTemplate->GetAllowableClass();\nif (allowableClass &\
      \ (1 << CLASS_WARRIOR)) {\n    // Warrior class can use this item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate if a character's class can equip an item
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\n\
      int32 allowableClass = itemTemplate->GetAllowableClass();\nif (allowableClass\
      \ == 0 || (allowableClass & (1 << player->getClass()))) {\n    // Item can be\
      \ equipped by this character\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses the internal data member that was populated
    from the database during server startup or item loading. The bitmask follows the
    standard class bit positions used throughout TrinityCore's codebase, where CLASS_WARRIOR
    = 0, CLASS_PALADIN = 1, etc. The value is cached and does not require additional
    database queries.
  warnings: Be aware that a return value of 0 typically means 'all classes allowed'
    rather than 'no classes allowed', which may be counterintuitive. When checking
    class permissions, always consider this special case. Also note that some items
    may have complex class restrictions involving multiple bits set, so bitwise operations
    should be used for proper evaluation.
