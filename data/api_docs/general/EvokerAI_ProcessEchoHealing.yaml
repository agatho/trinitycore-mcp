  method: ProcessEchoHealing
  signature: void EvokerAI::ProcessEchoHealing()
documentation:
  brief: Processes echo healing for the evoker AI, applying healing effects based
    on the evoker's current state and target conditions.
  description: The ProcessEchoHealing method is responsible for handling the echo
    healing mechanic specific to the Evoker class in TrinityCore. This method evaluates
    the evoker's current target, checks for valid healing conditions, and applies
    appropriate echo healing effects. It typically integrates with the AI's decision-making
    loop to determine when and how to use echo healing abilities. The method ensures
    that healing is only applied under proper game mechanics constraints such as target
    validity, mana availability, and cooldown states. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining balanced gameplay and proper AI behavior in evoker encounters.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    if (m_echoHealingTimer <= diff)\n    {\n        ProcessEchoHealing();\n\
      \        m_echoHealingTimer = 1000; // Reset timer\n    }\n    // ... rest of\
      \ AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the evoker AI has a valid target and
    sufficient resources. The healing effect is typically applied to nearby allies
    within range. Implementation may involve checking for existing healing effects
    on targets before applying new ones.
  warnings: Ensure that ProcessEchoHealing is not called excessively without proper
    cooldown management, as this could lead to performance issues or unintended gameplay
    behavior. The method assumes the AI has already validated target conditions.
