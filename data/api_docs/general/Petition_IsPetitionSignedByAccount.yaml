  signature: bool Petition::IsPetitionSignedByAccount(uint32 accountId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified account has signed the petition.
  description: The IsPetitionSignedByAccount method determines if a given account
    ID has already signed the current petition. This is used to prevent duplicate
    signatures and ensure that each player can only sign a petition once. The method
    typically checks against an internal list or set of account IDs that have signed
    the petition. In World of Warcraft's context, this would be relevant for guild
    petitions, character transfer petitions, or other in-game voting mechanisms where
    account ownership must be verified.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified account has signed the petition; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Account Has Signed Petition
    code: "uint32 accountId = player->GetSession()->GetAccountId();\nif (petition->IsPetitionSignedByAccount(accountId))\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where account has already signed\n    SendPetitionAlreadySignedMessage();\n\
      } else {\n    // Allow the account to sign the petition\n    petition->AddSignature(accountId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup in an internal data structure such as
    a std::set or std::unordered_set of account IDs. The performance is expected to
    be O(log n) or O(1) depending on the implementation. It's important to note that
    this check should occur before allowing a signature to be added to prevent duplicates.
  warnings: Ensure that the account ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    logged-in player session, as invalid IDs could lead to unexpected behavior or
    security issues if not properly validated.
