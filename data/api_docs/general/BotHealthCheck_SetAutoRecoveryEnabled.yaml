  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: SetAutoRecoveryEnabled
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::SetAutoRecoveryEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic health recovery feature for a bot.
  description: The SetAutoRecoveryEnabled method controls whether a bot will automatically
    recover its health during gameplay. When enabled, the bot's health will gradually
    restore over time based on game mechanics and configured settings. This functionality
    is typically used in automated bot systems to ensure that bots remain functional
    without requiring manual intervention. The method does not perform any validation
    or error checking on the input parameter.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether automatic health recovery should
      be enabled (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable auto recovery for a bot
    code: 'BotHealthCheck* healthCheck = new BotHealthCheck();

      healthCheck->SetAutoRecoveryEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable auto recovery for a bot
    code: 'BotHealthCheck* healthCheck = GetBotHealthCheck();

      healthCheck->SetAutoRecoveryEnabled(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the BotHealthCheck instance.
    It is recommended to call this method before starting bot operations to ensure
    consistent behavior. The actual recovery mechanics are handled by the underlying
    game system and may depend on other factors such as bot type, server settings,
    and player configuration.
