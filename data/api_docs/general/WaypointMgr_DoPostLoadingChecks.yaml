  signature: void WaypointMgr::DoPostLoadingChecks()
documentation:
  brief: Performs validation and consistency checks on loaded waypoint data for creatures.
  description: The DoPostLoadingChecks method validates the integrity of waypoint
    data that has been loaded into memory. It ensures that all waypoints are properly
    connected, that there are no orphaned or invalid waypoints, and that the sequence
    numbers are correctly ordered. This method is typically called after all creature
    waypoints have been loaded from the database to prevent runtime errors during
    pathfinding operations. The checks performed include verifying that each waypoint
    has a valid parent creature, ensuring sequential numbering without gaps, and confirming
    that movement types and parameters are within acceptable ranges.

  - title: Basic Usage in Core Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadCreatureWaypoints()\n{\n    sWaypointMgr->DoPostLoadingChecks();\n\
      \    // Additional loading logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically invoked during server startup and database loading
    phases. It may produce log messages for invalid waypoint configurations but does
    not halt execution. Developers should ensure that all creature waypoints are loaded
    before calling this method to avoid false positives.
  warnings: Calling this method before all waypoints are loaded will result in incomplete
    validation. The method assumes all data has been properly loaded from the database
    and does not perform any data loading operations itself.
