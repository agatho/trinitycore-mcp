documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit can be targeted for attack by players or NPCs.
  description: The isTargetableForAttack method checks if a unit is eligible to be
    targeted for attack, considering various game mechanics such as fake death status
    and visibility. This method is crucial for determining whether an NPC or player
    can be attacked, particularly in scenarios involving stealth, feign death, or
    other conditions that might prevent targeting. The function evaluates the unit's
    current state and determines if it's available for attack based on game rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is targetable for attack, false otherwise. A return
    value of false indicates that the unit cannot be attacked due to being in a state
    such as fake death or invisible.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->isTargetableForAttack()) {\n    // Unit can be targeted for attack\n\
      \    // Proceed with attack logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Unit cannot be attacked\n\
      \    // Skip attack logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other targeting and combat
    functions. It may not account for all possible states that could prevent targeting,
    such as invisibility or certain debuffs. Performance considerations are minimal,
    but the method should be used carefully during combat situations to avoid unnecessary
    overhead.
  warnings: The method does not consider all potential conditions that might prevent
    targeting, such as invisibility or stealth effects. It's important to understand
    that this function may return false even if a unit is visible and alive, due to
    fake death or other game mechanics.
