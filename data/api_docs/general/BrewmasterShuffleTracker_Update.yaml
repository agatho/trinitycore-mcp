  method: Update
  signature: void BrewmasterShuffleTracker::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Brewmaster Shuffle tracker state based on current player actions
    and cooldowns.
  description: The Update method in BrewmasterShuffleTracker is responsible for maintaining
    the internal state of the Brewmaster's Shuffle ability tracking system. It evaluates
    the current state of the player's shuffle cooldowns, checks if any shuffle effects
    are active, and updates relevant internal counters or flags accordingly. This
    method is typically called during game loop iterations to ensure that the shuffle
    tracking logic remains synchronized with the player's actual abilities and cooldown
    timers. The implementation likely interacts with the player's spell cooldown system
    and may update UI elements or trigger additional game events based on shuffle
    state changes.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'BrewmasterShuffleTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    tracking of shuffle cooldowns. It may internally query player state information
    and should not be called excessively in performance-critical sections.
