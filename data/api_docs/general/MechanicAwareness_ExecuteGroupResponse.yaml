  signature: void MechanicAwareness::ExecuteGroupResponse(const int & group, MechanicResponse
    response)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a mechanic response for a specified group in the MechanicAwareness
    system
  description: The ExecuteGroupResponse method processes and applies a given mechanic
    response to a specific group within the MechanicAwareness framework. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior systems where NPCs or game entities need to respond
    to mechanical events or triggers based on their group assignments. The method
    likely updates internal state, triggers callbacks, or modifies entity behaviors
    according to the provided response type. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and mechanic handling subsystems, ensuring that grouped entities react cohesively
    to game events.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier to which the response should be applied. This
      represents a logical grouping of entities that share similar behaviors or objectives
      within the MechanicAwareness system.
  - name: response
    description: The mechanic response to execute for the specified group. This parameter
      defines what action or behavior should be triggered for all members of the group,
      such as fleeing, attacking, or performing a specific animation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Response Execution
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      int groupId = 5;

      MechanicResponse response = MECHANIC_RESPONSE_FLEE;

      awareness.ExecuteGroupResponse(groupId, response);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Different Responses Based on Condition
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      int groupId = 10;

      MechanicResponse response = (someCondition) ? MECHANIC_RESPONSE_ATTACK : MECHANIC_RESPONSE_RETREAT;

      awareness.ExecuteGroupResponse(groupId, response);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI subsystem and may interact with
    other components such as group management, behavior trees, or event dispatchers.
    The actual implementation details depend on how the MechanicAwareness system is
    structured within TrinityCore's codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that the group identifier is valid and that the response type is
    supported by the current implementation to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
