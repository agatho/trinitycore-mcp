documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest objective can always be progressed within a raid
    environment.
  description: The CanAlwaysBeProgressedInRaid method evaluates if a given quest objective
    type is allowed to advance progress even when the player is inside a raid instance.
    This functionality is crucial for handling objectives that should remain active
    and trackable regardless of group composition or instance type. The method typically
    checks against predefined quest objective types that are designed to function
    consistently across different group settings, such as those involving item collection
    or specific kill counts. It ensures that certain quest mechanics maintain their
    intended behavior in both solo and raid scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective type can always be progressed
    within a raid; otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the objective's
    progression logic is unaffected by raid-specific restrictions or conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Objective Type Can Progress in Raid
    code: "if (QuestObjective::CanAlwaysBeProgressedInRaid(QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_KILL))\
      \ {\n    // This objective type can always be progressed in raid\n    player->AddQuestKill();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal quest objective type definitions and
    may be used during quest update processing to determine if progress should be
    recorded. Developers should ensure that any new quest objective types are properly
    categorized for raid progression behavior.
