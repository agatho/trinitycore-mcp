documentation:
  brief: Despawn all creatures and game objects in a specified spawn group
  description: The SpawnGroupDespawn method removes all creatures and game objects
    that belong to a specific spawn group from the map. This method is used to clean
    up spawned entities when a group needs to be removed or reset. The method returns
    true if the despawn operation was successful, false otherwise. It supports optional
    deletion of respawn times and can optionally return the count of entities removed.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the spawn group to despawn. This is typically
      a numeric ID that corresponds to a specific set of creatures or game objects
      in the database.
  - name: deleteRespawnTimes
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to delete respawn times associated
      with the despawned entities. If true, the respawn times are removed from the
      database; if false, they remain intact.
  - name: count
    description: Pointer to a size_t variable that will be filled with the number
      of entities successfully despawned. This parameter is optional and can be nullptr
      if not needed.
  returns: Returns true if the despawn operation was successful, false otherwise.
    The method may return false in cases where the group does not exist or when the
    despawning process fails due to internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      bool success = map->SpawnGroupDespawn(12345, true, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Count
    code: "Map* map = GetMap();\nsize_t count;\nbool success = map->SpawnGroupDespawn(12345,\
      \ false, &count);\nif (success) {\n    printf(\"Despawned %zu entities\\n\"\
      , count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during map loading or reset operations. It
    may be called from multiple threads depending on the context, but should be used
    carefully to avoid race conditions. Performance impact is minimal when used correctly,
    but excessive use can lead to unnecessary database overhead.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with deleteRespawnTimes set to true,
    as it may cause issues if respawn times are needed later for re-spawning. Also,
    ensure that the groupId exists before calling this method to avoid errors.
