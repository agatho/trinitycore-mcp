documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's mastery rating and associated stats
  description: The UpdateMastery method recalculates and applies the player's mastery
    rating, which affects various gameplay mechanics such as spell power, critical
    strike chance, and other class-specific bonuses. This method is typically invoked
    when mastery-related attributes change, such as when a player gains new talents
    or equipment that modifies their mastery stat. The update process ensures that
    all dependent systems receive the correct mastery values for calculations and
    display purposes.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mastery Update
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateMastery();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally triggers stat recalculations for mastery-dependent
    abilities and may affect tooltip displays. It should be called after any changes
    to mastery-related attributes to ensure consistency across the player's active
    effects.
