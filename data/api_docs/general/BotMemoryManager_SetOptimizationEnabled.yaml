  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: SetOptimizationEnabled
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::SetOptimizationEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables memory optimization features within the bot memory manager.
  description: The SetOptimizationEnabled method controls whether the BotMemoryManager
    applies memory optimization techniques to reduce resource consumption and improve
    performance for AI-controlled bots. When enabled, the system may employ strategies
    such as object pooling, lazy initialization, or reduced memory allocations to
    minimize overhead. This setting affects all bot instances managed by this memory
    manager and can be toggled at runtime. The change takes effect immediately without
    requiring a restart or reinitialization of existing bots.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether optimization should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false). When true, memory optimization features are activated;
      when false, they are deactivated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Memory Optimization
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->SetOptimizationEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Memory Optimization for Performance Testing
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->SetOptimizationEnabled(false);

      // Useful for profiling or debugging bot behavior without optimization interference'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a global level for the BotMemoryManager instance.
    Changes to this setting affect all bots managed by the same memory manager instance.
    The optimization features may introduce slight delays during initial setup but
    generally improve long-term performance and stability.
  warnings: Disabling optimization might lead to increased memory usage and potential
    performance degradation over time, especially with many active bots. Ensure that
    any changes are tested in a controlled environment before deploying to production
    servers.
