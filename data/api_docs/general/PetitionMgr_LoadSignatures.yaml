documentation:
  brief: Loads all petition signatures from the database into memory for processing
    and validation.
  description: The LoadSignatures method initializes the petition signature system
    by retrieving all stored signatures from the database and caching them in memory.
    This allows the PetitionMgr to quickly validate player signatures, check for duplicate
    submissions, and manage the petition signing process. The method is typically
    called during server startup or when the petition system is initialized. It ensures
    that all previously collected signatures are available for immediate use without
    requiring repeated database queries during active gameplay.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializePetitionSystem()\n{\n    sPetitionMgr->LoadSignatures();\n\
      \    // Petition signatures are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query to fetch all petition signatures, which
    may cause a slight delay during server startup. The signatures are cached in memory
    for fast access during petition validation. This method should only be called
    once during initialization and not repeatedly during normal operation.
