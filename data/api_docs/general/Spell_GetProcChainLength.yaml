  class: Spell
  method: GetProcChainLength
  signature: int32 Spell::GetProcChainLength() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the proc chain length of the spell, determining how many times a
    proc can occur in sequence.
  description: The GetProcChainLength method retrieves the maximum number of times
    a spell's proc can trigger in succession. This value is crucial for understanding
    the behavior of spells with proc effects, particularly those that can stack or
    have multiple triggers. The method returns an integer representing the chain length,
    which affects how many times a proc can occur before it resets. This information
    is essential for game mechanics involving spell proc systems and can influence
    the frequency of certain effects in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the maximum number of procs that can
    occur in sequence for this spell. A value of 0 indicates no proc chain, while
    positive values indicate the number of times a proc can trigger consecutively.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 chainLength = spell->GetProcChainLength();\nif (chainLength > 0)\n\
      {\n    // This spell can proc multiple times\n    // Process the proc chain\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other proc-related methods
    to determine complete proc behavior. The value returned may be influenced by various
    factors including spell modifiers, talent effects, and class-specific abilities.
    Implementation details include the fact that this value is often stored internally
    within the spell object and may be affected by different game mechanics.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may not always reflect
    the actual proc behavior in all scenarios. Some spells might have special handling
    for proc chains that could override the standard chain length returned by this
    method.
