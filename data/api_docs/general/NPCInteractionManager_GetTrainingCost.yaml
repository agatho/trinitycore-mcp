documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the training cost for a player to learn skills from
    a specified trainer creature.
  description: The GetTrainingCost method determines the gold cost required for a
    player to train their skills with a given NPC trainer. This method is typically
    invoked during NPC interaction when a player attempts to learn new abilities or
    improve existing ones. The calculation considers factors such as the trainer's
    type, the specific skill being trained, and potentially the player's current skill
    level or reputation with the trainer. It returns a uint32 value representing the
    cost in copper coins, where 0 typically indicates no cost or an invalid training
    request.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the training cost in copper coins. Returns
    0 if the trainer is invalid, the skill cannot be trained, or there's no cost associated
    with the training action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* trainer)\n{\n    uint32 cost\
      \ = sNPCInteractionManager->GetTrainingCost(trainer);\n    if (cost > 0)\n \
      \   {\n        player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Training costs %u gold.\"\
      , cost / 10000);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      No training cost for this skill.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal databases or configuration files
    to determine training costs. It may also consider the player's current skill level
    and the trainer's available skill list. The returned value is always in copper
    (1 gold = 100 silver = 10000 copper).
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    an actual trainer NPC; otherwise, it may return unexpected values or cause undefined
    behavior.
