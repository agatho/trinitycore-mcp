  class: GroupFormation
  method: SetFormationType
  signature: void GroupFormation::SetFormationType(FormationType type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation type for a group in the World of Warcraft instance.
  description: The SetFormationType method configures the tactical formation that
    a group will use during combat or movement. This method is typically used by the
    game's AI system to determine how players or NPCs should position themselves relative
    to each other. The formation type affects behavior such as spacing, positioning,
    and coordination during group activities like raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
    It is important to note that this method does not directly control individual
    unit movement but rather establishes a template for how the group's members should
    align with one another.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The FormationType enum value specifying the desired formation behavior.
      Valid values include FORMATION_TYPE_DEFAULT, FORMATION_TYPE_CIRCLE, FORMATION_TYPE_LINE,
      FORMATION_TYPE_ARROW, etc., depending on the implementation and available formations
      in the TrinityCore version.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Circle Formation
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      formation->SetFormationType(FORMATION_TYPE_CIRCLE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Formation Type Enum in Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player->GetGroup()) {\n    GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();\n\
      \    if (IsPlayerInCombat()) {\n        formation->SetFormationType(FORMATION_TYPE_ARROW);\n\
      \    } else {\n        formation->SetFormationType(FORMATION_TYPE_LINE);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal state variables within the GroupFormation
    class and may trigger events or callbacks to notify other systems about the change
    in formation. It is recommended to call this method before engaging combat or
    when preparing for coordinated group actions.
  warnings: Calling SetFormationType without a valid group context can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that player->GetGroup() returns a non-null pointer
    before invoking this method. Additionally, some formations might not be supported
    in all game modes or scenarios.
