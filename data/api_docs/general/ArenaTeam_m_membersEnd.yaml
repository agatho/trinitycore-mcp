  brief: Returns the end iterator index for the arena team's member list
  description: The m_membersEnd method provides the ending index position for iterating
    through the arena team's member collection. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with m_membersBegin to define the range of valid members within the team. The
    returned value represents one past the last valid member index, following standard
    C++ iterator conventions. This allows for proper iteration over the arena team's
    roster without accessing invalid memory locations. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is read-only.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the end position index of the arena team members
    collection. This value should be used as the upper bound in range-based loops
    or iterator operations to traverse all valid members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic iteration through arena team members
    code: "for (int i = arenaTeam->m_membersBegin(); i < arenaTeam->m_membersEnd();\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    ArenaTeamMember* member = arenaTeam->GetMemberByIndex(i);\n \
      \   // Process each member\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena team data structure management
    and should be used carefully when implementing custom arena team functionality.
    The returned index value is typically used in range-based iteration patterns rather
    than direct indexing operations.
