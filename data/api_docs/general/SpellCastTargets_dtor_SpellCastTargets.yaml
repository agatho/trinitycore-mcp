  brief: Destroys a SpellCastTargets object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpellCastTargets class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used to store target
    information for spell casting. This includes releasing references to units, game
    objects, items, or areas that may have been set as targets during a spell cast.
    The destructor ensures proper memory management and prevents resource leaks when
    a SpellCastTargets instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's spell system, this method plays a crucial role in maintaining
    clean state after spell execution or cancellation.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SpellCastTargets
    code: "void SomeSpellHandler() {\n    SpellCastTargets targets;\n    // ... set\
      \ targets ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when targets goes out\
      \ of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of SpellCastTargets pointer
    code: 'SpellCastTargets* targets = new SpellCastTargets();

      // ... set targets ...

      del targets; // Triggers destructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a SpellCastTargets
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless
    explicitly managing memory through pointers. The implementation likely handles
    cleanup of internal data structures such as target GUIDs, positions, and other
    spell targeting information.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor on stack-allocated objects; let
    the compiler handle destruction automatically. Be cautious when using raw pointers
    to SpellCastTargets objects to avoid memory leaks or double-deletion issues.
