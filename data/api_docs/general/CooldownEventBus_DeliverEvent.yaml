  class: CooldownEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: bool CooldownEventBus::DeliverEvent(BotAI * subscriber, const CooldownEvent
    & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers a cooldown event to a specified bot AI subscriber.
  description: The DeliverEvent method is responsible for routing and dispatching
    cooldown events to registered bot AI subscribers within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method ensures that cooldown-related information, such as spell or ability
    readiness, is properly communicated to AI-controlled characters. It handles the
    internal logic of event distribution and returns a boolean indicating whether
    the delivery was successful. The method operates within the context of the CooldownEventBus
    system, which manages the flow of cooldown-related data between game systems and
    AI components.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will receive the cooldown event.
      This parameter must be a valid pointer to an active bot AI object; otherwise,
      the method may fail or cause undefined behavior.
  - name: event
    description: The CooldownEvent object containing the cooldown information to be
      delivered. This includes details such as the spell ID, cooldown duration, and
      other relevant cooldown data that the subscriber needs to process.
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully delivered to the subscriber,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the subscriber
    was invalid or the delivery mechanism encountered an error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: "CooldownEvent event;\nevent.spellId = 12345;\nevent.cooldownEnd = time(nullptr)\
      \ + 10;\nbool success = cooldownBus.DeliverEvent(botAI, event);\nif (success)\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"ai.bot\", \"Cooldown event delivered successfully\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Event Delivery with Error Handling
    code: "if (!botAI)\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"ai.bot\", \"Invalid bot AI subscriber\
      \ provided\");\n    return false;\n}\n\nCooldownEvent event;\nevent.spellId\
      \ = 67890;\nevent.cooldownEnd = time(nullptr) + 30;\n\nbool result = cooldownBus.DeliverEvent(botAI,\
      \ event);\nif (!result)\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"ai.bot\", \"Failed to deliver\
      \ cooldown event to bot AI\");\n    return false;\n}\nTC_LOG_DEBUG(\"ai.bot\"\
      , \"Cooldown event delivered successfully to bot AI\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI event system in TrinityCore and relies
    on proper initialization of both the CooldownEventBus and the BotAI subscriber.
    The method assumes that the BotAI instance has been properly registered with the
    event bus before attempting delivery. Performance considerations should be taken
    into account when delivering frequent cooldown events, as this may impact AI responsiveness.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid BotAI pointer to this method can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Always validate the subscriber pointer before calling DeliverEvent.
    Additionally, ensure that the CooldownEvent object contains valid data; malformed
    events may cause issues in downstream processing.
