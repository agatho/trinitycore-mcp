api:
  class: GameObject
  method: GetDestructibleState
  signature: int GameObject::GetDestructibleState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the destructible state of the game object, indicating its current
    damage status and repairability.
  description: The GetDestructibleState method retrieves the current destructible
    state of a GameObject, which determines how much damage it has sustained and whether
    it can still be repaired or destroyed. This value is crucial for determining the
    object's behavior in World of Warcraft gameplay mechanics, particularly regarding
    destruction and repair systems. The method returns an integer representing the
    state of the object's destructible health, with values typically ranging from
    0 to 100, where 0 indicates complete destruction and 100 represents full health.
    This information is essential for handling game object interactions, especially
    in scenarios involving damage, repair, and destruction mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the destructible state of the GameObject,
    where values typically range from 0 (completely destroyed) to 100 (fully healthy).
    The exact meaning depends on the specific game object type and its implementation
    within TrinityCore's framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int state = gameObject->GetDestructibleState();\nif (state == 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Object is completely destroyed\n}\nelse if (state > 0)\n{\n    // Object\
      \ has some health remaining\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely accesses internal game object
    state variables that track destructible health. Performance considerations: The
    method is lightweight and should not cause noticeable performance impact during
    gameplay. Thread safety: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from the
    object''s state without modifying it.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using the returned value incorrectly in conditional
    statements can lead to misinterpretation of game object status. Dangerous edge
    cases: If the method returns values outside expected ranges, it may indicate corrupted
    data or improper implementation of the game object''s destructible system.'
