  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: OnDeactivate
  signature: void CombatMovementStrategy::OnDeactivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the combat movement strategy for a bot AI, cleaning up any active
    movement states or flags.
  description: The OnDeactivate method is called when the CombatMovementStrategy is
    deactivated, typically during state transitions or when the bot AI is no longer
    engaged in combat-related movement behaviors. This method ensures that any ongoing
    movement commands, flags, or internal state related to combat movement are properly
    reset or cleared. It may also handle cleanup of temporary data structures or revert
    changes made to the bot's movement behavior. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations, serving purely as a cleanup hook for the strategy.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI State Transition
    code: "void MyBotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_isInCombat && !m_strategy->IsActive())\n\
      \    {\n        m_strategy->OnDeactivate(this);\n        // Strategy is now\
      \ deactivated, movement behavior reset\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the strategy is no longer needed to
    prevent memory leaks or inconsistent movement states. It is typically invoked
    by the AI framework during state changes rather than directly by user code.
