documentation:
  brief: Marks the channel as modified to trigger synchronization with clients.
  description: The SetDirty method marks a channel object as being modified, which
    signals that its state needs to be synchronized with connected clients. This is
    typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to ensure that changes
    to channel properties, such as membership or permissions, are properly communicated
    to all affected players. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no direct operations beyond setting an internal dirty flag.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a channel as dirty after adding a member
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->AddMember(player);\n    channel->SetDirty(); //\
      \ Notify clients of the new member\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by other channel manipulation
    methods. Developers should not typically need to call SetDirty() directly unless
    implementing custom channel logic or debugging synchronization issues.
