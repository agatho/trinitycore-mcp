  signature: void BotSessionFactory::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot session factory, cleaning up all active bot sessions and
    releasing associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot sessions managed by
    the BotSessionFactory instance. It ensures that all active bot clients are properly
    disconnected, their memory is freed, and any pending operations are canceled.
    This method is typically invoked during server shutdown or when the bot system
    needs to be temporarily disabled. The method performs a graceful cleanup of resources
    without leaving any dangling references or active connections. It should only
    be called when no other operations are actively using the bot sessions to avoid
    potential race conditions or resource corruption.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotSessionFactory* factory = BotSessionFactory::Instance();

      factory->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
    It internally handles synchronization to ensure that all active sessions are properly
    terminated before returning control to the caller.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while bot sessions are actively processing commands may
    result in incomplete operations or data loss. Ensure all bot activities are paused
    or completed before invoking this method.
