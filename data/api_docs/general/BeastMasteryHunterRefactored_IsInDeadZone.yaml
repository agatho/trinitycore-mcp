documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter is within the dead zone range of a beast companion.
  description: The IsInDeadZone method checks if the hunter's current position relative
    to their beast companion falls within a predefined 'dead zone' area. This functionality
    is typically used in Beast Mastery hunter gameplay mechanics to determine when
    the hunter should or should not perform certain actions, such as avoiding damage
    or maintaining optimal positioning. The method evaluates the distance and positional
    relationship between the hunter and their pet to decide if they are in a state
    where special handling is required. This check often involves comparing the hunter's
    position against the pet's current location and a defined radius or boundary.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter is within the dead zone range of their beast
    companion, false otherwise. The dead zone typically represents an area where the
    hunter's positioning may be considered suboptimal for certain abilities or where
    specific game mechanics are triggered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check dead zone status
    code: "if (hunter->IsInDeadZone()) {\n    // Perform alternative action when in\
      \ dead zone\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ALTERNATIVE_ACTION);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using dead zone check in combat logic
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::UpdateCombatState() {\n    if (IsInDeadZone())\
      \ {\n        // Adjust positioning or avoid certain abilities\n        MoveToSafePosition();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Normal combat behavior\n        CastSpellOnTarget();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations between the hunter and
    their pet using positional data from the game world. The dead zone definition
    may be configurable or based on specific hunter abilities like 'Beast Mastery'
    talent trees. Performance-wise, this check should be lightweight as it's typically
    called during regular update cycles.
  warnings: The method signature shows a parameter of type int*, but the documentation
    states there are no parameters. This discrepancy should be resolved in actual
    implementation. Also, the dead zone calculation may not account for terrain or
    obstacles in some game versions, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in
    complex environments.
