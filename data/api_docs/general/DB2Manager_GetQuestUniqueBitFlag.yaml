  method: GetQuestUniqueBitFlag
  signature: uint32 DB2Manager::GetQuestUniqueBitFlag(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique bit flag associated with a specific quest ID from the
    DB2 database.
  description: The GetQuestUniqueBitFlag method fetches a unique bit flag value that
    corresponds to a given quest identifier. This flag is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's quest system to track quest completion status or to identify specific
    quest-related data within the game's internal systems. The method accesses the
    DB2 database manager which stores structured data about quests, including their
    unique identifiers and associated metadata. It is commonly used during quest handling
    logic to determine if a particular quest has been completed or to manage quest-specific
    flags in player data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique bit flag associated with
    the specified quest ID. If no valid mapping exists for the given quest ID, the
    method may return zero or an undefined value depending on internal implementation
    and database state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 questFlag = sDB2Manager->GetQuestUniqueBitFlag(12345);\nif (questFlag\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process the quest flag\n    printf(\"Quest 12345 has unique\
      \ bit flag: %u\\n\", questFlag);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures and assumes that the quest
    ID provided exists in the database. The returned bit flag value is typically used
    as a bitmask for efficient storage and retrieval of quest-related state information.
    Ensure that DB2Manager is properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent quest ID may result
    in undefined behavior or return zero. Always validate the quest ID before use,
    especially when dealing with dynamic quest data or user input.
