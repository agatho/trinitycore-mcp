  method: RegisterProfile
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::RegisterProfile(const BehaviorProfile &
    profile)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new behavior profile with the adaptive behavior manager for use
    in AI decision-making.
  description: The RegisterProfile method allows developers to add a BehaviorProfile
    object to the AdaptiveBehaviorManager's internal registry. This enables the AI
    system to utilize predefined behavioral patterns when making decisions about NPC
    actions, movement, and interactions. The method typically stores the profile in
    an internal container or map for later retrieval during runtime. Profiles registered
    through this method are expected to be immutable after registration to maintain
    consistency in AI behavior. This is a core part of TrinityCore's adaptive AI framework,
    allowing for dynamic behavior modification without requiring code recompilation.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: The BehaviorProfile object containing the behavioral rules and parameters
      to register with the manager. This should include all necessary configuration
      data such as action priorities, decision thresholds, and behavior weights.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Registration
    code: 'BehaviorProfile myProfile;

      myProfile.name = "AggressiveCombat";

      myProfile.priority = 100;

      myProfile.actions.push_back("MeleeAttack");

      myProfile.actions.push_back("Charge");

      manager.RegisterProfile(myProfile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Profiles
    code: 'BehaviorProfile patrolProfile;

      patrolProfile.name = "PatrolBehavior";

      patrolProfile.priority = 50;

      patrolProfile.actions.push_back("MoveToWaypoint");

      patrolProfile.actions.push_back("Idle");


      BehaviorProfile combatProfile;

      combatProfile.name = "CombatBehavior";

      combatProfile.priority = 150;

      combatProfile.actions.push_back("SpellCast");

      combatProfile.actions.push_back("Flee");


      manager.RegisterProfile(patrolProfile);

      manager.RegisterProfile(combatProfile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when loading
    behavior configurations from database or configuration files. The manager may
    perform validation on the profile data upon registration, and duplicate profiles
    with identical names might be rejected or handled according to specific rules
    defined by the implementation.
  warnings: Calling RegisterProfile with an invalid or malformed BehaviorProfile can
    lead to undefined behavior in the AI system. Ensure that all required fields of
    the BehaviorProfile are properly initialized before registration. Avoid registering
    profiles during active AI processing cycles as it may cause race conditions or
    inconsistent behavior.
