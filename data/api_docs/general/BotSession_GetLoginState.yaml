  class: BotSession
  method: GetLoginState
  signature: LoginState BotSession::GetLoginState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current login state of the bot session.
  description: The GetLoginState method returns the current authentication and connection
    status of a bot session. This method is used to determine whether the bot is currently
    logged in, logging in, or disconnected from the game server. The returned LoginState
    enum provides detailed information about the session's state, which can be used
    to control bot behavior, handle reconnections, or manage session lifecycle events.
    This is particularly useful for managing automated gameplay behaviors and ensuring
    proper synchronization with the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A LoginState enumeration value indicating the current state of the bot
    session. Possible values typically include LOGGED_IN, LOGGING_IN, DISCONNECTED,
    or other session-specific states depending on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Check Bot Login State
    code: "if (botSession->GetLoginState() == LOGIN_STATE_LOGGED_IN) {\n    // Bot\
      \ is logged in, proceed with gameplay\n    botSession->ExecuteCommand(\"move\
      \ forward\");\n} else {\n    // Handle login or connection issues\n    botSession->Reconnect();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: State-Based Bot Behavior
    code: "LoginState state = botSession->GetLoginState();\nswitch (state) {\n   \
      \ case LOGIN_STATE_LOGGED_IN:\n        // Perform game actions\n        break;\n\
      \    case LOGIN_STATE_LOGGING_IN:\n        // Wait or queue actions\n      \
      \  break;\n    case LOGIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED:\n        // Attempt reconnection\n\
      \        botSession->Reconnect();\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during bot operation to monitor
    session health. The login state may change rapidly during connection transitions,
    so caching the result for extended periods may lead to stale information. This
    method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context.
  warnings: Do not assume that a logged-in state means the bot is ready for gameplay
    - additional checks for character readiness or server response may be required.
    Repeated calls to this method in tight loops may impact performance, though the
    implementation should be optimized for frequent polling.
