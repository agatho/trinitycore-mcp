documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ActionPriorityQueue class for managing
    AI action priorities.
  description: The ActionPriorityQueue constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ActionPriorityQueue class, which is used to manage and prioritize AI actions within
    the TrinityCore framework. This queue typically handles the ordering of actions
    based on priority levels, ensuring that higher-priority actions are executed before
    lower-priority ones. The implementation likely uses a data structure such as a
    priority queue or similar mechanism to maintain action ordering. This class is
    commonly utilized in AI behavior systems where multiple actions need to be evaluated
    and scheduled according to their importance or urgency.

  examples:
  - title: Creating an ActionPriorityQueue instance
    code: 'ActionPriorityQueue queue;

      // The queue is now initialized and ready to accept actions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or allocation.
    It simply sets up the internal data structures needed for action prioritization.
    Developers should be aware that this class may be used extensively in AI systems,
    so performance considerations for frequent instantiation should be taken into
    account.
