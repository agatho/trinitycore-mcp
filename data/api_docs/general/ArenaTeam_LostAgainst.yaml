    int32 & rating_change)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the MMR rating change for a player who lost an arena match.
  description: The LostAgainst method computes the change in a player's Matchmaking
    Rating (MMR) after losing an arena match. It takes into account both the player's
    own MMR and their opponent's MMR to determine how much the rating should decrease.
    This method is typically used internally by the arena system to update player
    ratings following a match outcome. The calculation considers the relative skill
    levels of both players, with larger rating changes expected when facing opponents
    significantly stronger or weaker than oneself.
  parameters:
  - name: Own_MMRating
    description: The Matchmaking Rating (MMR) of the player who lost the match.
  - name: Opponent_MMRating
    description: The Matchmaking Rating (MMR) of the opponent who won the match.
  - name: rating_change
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the calculated
      rating change value. A negative value indicates a decrease in MMR, while a positive
      value would indicate an increase (though this is not typical for a loss).
  returns: Returns an integer representing the base rating change amount used in the
    calculation. This value may be positive or negative depending on the relative
    ratings of the players involved.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate MMR change after losing an arena match
    code: "uint32 myRating = 1800;\nuint32 opponentRating = 2000;\nint32 change;\n\
      ArenaTeam* team = sObjectAccessor->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n{\n\
      \    int32 baseChange = team->LostAgainst(myRating, opponentRating, change);\n\
      \    // 'change' now contains the calculated rating adjustment\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena matchmaking and rating system.
    It assumes that the player has already lost the match and is being called to update
    their MMR accordingly. The actual rating change may be adjusted further by other
    factors such as match duration, team composition, or seasonal modifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided MMR values are valid and up-to-date before calling
    this method. Using stale or incorrect ratings can lead to inaccurate MMR adjustments
    which may affect player matchmaking experience.
