  signature: void ScenarioMgr::~ScenarioMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ScenarioMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ScenarioMgr class is responsible for cleaning
    up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the scenario management
    system. This includes releasing any held references to scenario data, clearing
    internal containers, and ensuring proper cleanup of scenario-related objects before
    the manager instance is destroyed. The destructor is automatically invoked when
    a ScenarioMgr object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, making it an
    essential part of the class's resource management lifecycle. In the context of
    TrinityCore's architecture, this method ensures that scenario data does not cause
    memory leaks or dangling references when the game server shuts down or when scenario
    systems are reinitialized.

  - title: Automatic destruction of ScenarioMgr instance
    code: "void CleanupScenarios()\n{\n    // ScenarioMgr is automatically destroyed\
      \ when it goes out of scope\n    {\n        ScenarioMgr* scenarioManager = new\
      \ ScenarioMgr();\n        // ... use scenarioManager ...\n    } // Destructor\
      \ called here automatically\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was allocated
    with 'new'. In TrinityCore, ScenarioMgr is typically managed by the server's core
    systems and destroyed during shutdown. The destructor performs cleanup operations
    that are critical for preventing memory leaks in long-running server processes.
  warnings: Do not explicitly call this destructor unless you have created the ScenarioMgr
    instance using 'new'. Manual invocation of destructors on stack-allocated objects
    can lead to undefined behavior. Also, ensure no other threads are accessing scenario
    data during destruction to prevent race conditions.
