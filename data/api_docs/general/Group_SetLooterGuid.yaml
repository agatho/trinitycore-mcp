  class: Group
  method: SetLooterGuid
  signature: void Group::SetLooterGuid(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the player designated as the looter for the group.
  description: The SetLooterGuid method assigns a specific player's unique identifier
    (GUID) as the designated looter within a World of Warcraft group. This functionality
    is crucial for managing loot distribution in groups, particularly when using the
    Group Loot system where one player is responsible for rolling on items and distributing
    them to group members. The method updates internal group state to reflect this
    looter designation, which affects how loot is handled during group encounters.
    This operation typically occurs when a group leader or raid leader designates
    a specific player as the looter, often based on class specialization or role assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will be designated
      as the group looter. This should be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Player as Group Looter
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetLooterGuid(player->GetGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Designating a Specific Player as Looter
    code: "Player* looter = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ 12345));\nGroup* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && looter)\n{\n  \
      \  group->SetLooterGuid(looter->GetGUID());\n    // Notify players about the\
      \ new looter\n    group->SendUpdate();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal group state and should be called with
    appropriate permission checks. The GUID parameter must refer to a valid player
    currently in the group, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method does not
    validate that the specified player is eligible to be a looter according to game
    rules or loot settings.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the target player is actually
    part of the group may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The GUID must be
    a valid player GUID; using an invalid or non-player GUID can cause undefined behavior
    in the group system.
