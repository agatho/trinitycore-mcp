  signature: void GroupCoordinator::UpdateGroupState(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the state of the group coordinator, processing any pending group-related
    operations and maintaining group synchronization.
  description: The UpdateGroupState method is responsible for maintaining the current
    state of a group coordinator within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    handles time-based updates, synchronization of group members, and processing of
    group-related events that occur during gameplay. It is commonly called from the
    main game loop to ensure that group data remains consistent and up-to-date. The
    method processes any pending operations such as member additions, removals, or
    status changes, and ensures that all group members are properly synchronized with
    the current group state. This function plays a critical role in maintaining the
    integrity of group mechanics including loot distribution, instance management,
    and player coordination.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Update group coordinator\
      \ state\n    sGroupCoordinator->UpdateGroupState(diff);\n    \n    // Other\
      \ update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management System
    code: "void GroupManager::UpdateGroups(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Iterate through\
      \ all active groups\n    for (auto& group : m_groups)\n    {\n        if (group->IsLeader(player))\n\
      \        {\n            group->GetCoordinator()->UpdateGroupState(diff);\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain proper
    group state synchronization. The 'diff' parameter represents the time elapsed
    since last update in milliseconds, which is crucial for timing-based operations
    such as loot timers or group member timeouts.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to desynchronization between
    group members and the server state, potentially causing issues with loot distribution,
    instance entry permissions, or player coordination. Ensure that this method is
    called consistently from the main game thread to avoid race conditions.
