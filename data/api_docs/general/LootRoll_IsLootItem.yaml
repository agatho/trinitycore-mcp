  class: LootRoll
  method: IsLootItem
  signature: bool LootRoll::IsLootItem(const int & lootObject, uint32 lootListId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified loot object is associated with a specific
    loot list ID.
  description: The IsLootItem method checks if a given loot object identifier is present
    in the current loot roll's associated loot list. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to validate that a particular item or loot entry
    belongs to a specific loot group during the rolling process. It ensures proper
    handling of loot distribution and prevents invalid loot items from being processed
    during a roll. The method typically operates on the internal state of the LootRoll
    object, comparing the provided lootObject against known entries in its associated
    loot list.
  parameters:
  - name: lootObject
    description: The identifier of the loot item to check. This is typically a database
      entry ID or GUID that uniquely identifies a specific item within the loot system.
  - name: lootListId
    description: The identifier of the loot list to which the loot object should belong.
      This corresponds to a specific group or pool of loot items defined in the game's
      loot templates.
  returns: Returns true if the specified lootObject is found within the loot list
    identified by lootListId; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (roll->IsLootItem(12345, 67890)) {\n    // Process the loot item\n \
      \   printf(\"Item is part of the loot list\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: In Loot Roll Context
    code: "LootRoll* roll = player->GetLootRoll(1001);\nif (roll && roll->IsLootItem(itemGuid,\
      \ 2002)) {\n    // This item belongs to the current loot list\n    roll->Roll();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used during the loot rolling process in World of
    Warcraft instances. It relies on internal data structures that map loot objects
    to their respective loot lists. The method does not perform any database queries
    directly but works with cached or pre-loaded data from the game's loot system.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    lootObject or lootListId values may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
    This method should only be called on initialized LootRoll objects.
