  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the assassination rogue's rotation logic based on current target
    and combat state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for driving the core decision-making
    process of an assassination rogue's combat rotation. It evaluates the current
    target, player status, available abilities, and combat conditions to determine
    the optimal next action in the rotation sequence. This method typically checks
    for valid targets, manages combo point generation, assesses buff/debuff states,
    and selects appropriate abilities such as Sinister Strike, Backstab, or Envenom
    based on game mechanics and resource availability. The method integrates with
    the broader AI framework to ensure tactical decision-making aligns with the assassination
    specialization's gameplay paradigm.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the combat system. This parameter is used to access and evaluate the current
      target's state, health, and other relevant combat properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateRotation call
    code: 'int targetId = player->GetTarget();

      rogue->UpdateRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat loop
    code: "void RogueAI::Update()\n{\n    if (player->IsInCombat())\n    {\n     \
      \   int target = player->GetTarget();\n        rogue->UpdateRotation(&target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the AI update loop and should be invoked
    frequently during combat. The target parameter must point to a valid target that
    exists in the current combat environment. Performance considerations include avoiding
    expensive operations within this method to maintain smooth gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly validated before passing it
    to this method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer may cause undefined behavior.
    This method assumes that the player is in a valid combat state and may not behave
    correctly if called outside of combat.
