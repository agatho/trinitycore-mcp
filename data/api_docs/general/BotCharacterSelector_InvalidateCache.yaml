  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: InvalidateCache
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::InvalidateCache(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the cached character data for a specific account, forcing a reload
    of bot character selections.
  description: The InvalidateCache method removes all cached character selection data
    associated with the specified account ID. This ensures that subsequent requests
    for bot character selection will fetch fresh data from the database instead of
    using stale cached values. The method is typically invoked when account-related
    character data has been modified, such as when a character is created, deleted,
    or when account permissions are updated. It helps maintain consistency in bot
    behavior by ensuring that the character selection logic operates on current account
    state rather than outdated cache entries.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account whose cached character data
      should be invalidated. Must be a valid, non-zero account ID present in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating Cache for Specific Account
    code: 'BotCharacterSelector selector;

      selector.InvalidateCache(12345); // Clears cache for account with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Response to Character Modification
    code: "void OnCharacterCreated(uint32 accountId) {\n    BotCharacterSelector selector;\n\
      \    selector.InvalidateCache(accountId);\n    // Bot character selection will\
      \ now reflect the new character\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a per-account basis and does not affect other accounts'
    cached data. It is recommended to call this method immediately after modifying
    account-related character data to ensure consistency. The cache invalidation is
    performed synchronously, which may cause a brief delay if large amounts of data
    are being invalidated.
  warnings: Calling InvalidateCache with an invalid or non-existent accountId may
    result in undefined behavior or performance degradation. Ensure that the accountId
    parameter refers to an actual existing account before invoking this method.
