  class: RuneRunicPowerResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void RuneRunicPowerResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the runic power resource for a player, setting up necessary data
    structures and state tracking for rune management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares a Player object's runic power resource
    system by establishing internal data structures required for tracking rune states,
    cooldowns, and resource generation. This method is typically invoked during player
    login or when the player's class-specific resource system needs to be activated.
    It ensures that all rune-related properties are properly initialized with default
    values and that the player's runic power state is synchronized with the game engine's
    expectations. The method does not directly modify the player's current runic power
    value but rather sets up the infrastructure needed for subsequent rune operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get player reference

      RuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      resource.Initialize(bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player instance during initialization.
    It assumes that the Player object is valid and properly constructed. The method
    may perform internal checks to prevent reinitialization, though this behavior
    isn't explicitly documented.
  warnings: Calling Initialize on a player who has already been initialized may lead
    to undefined behavior or resource leaks. Ensure proper lifecycle management of
    player resources when using this method.
