  class: ManaSoulShardResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool ManaSoulShardResource::Consume(uint32 manaCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes mana soul shards to reduce the resource count based on the specified
    mana cost
  description: The Consume method attempts to deduct a specified amount of mana from
    the player's mana soul shard resource. It checks whether sufficient resources
    are available before performing the deduction. This method is typically used during
    spell casting or other abilities that require consuming mana soul shards as a
    resource. The operation returns true if the consumption was successful, and false
    if there were insufficient resources to fulfill the request.
  parameters:
  - name: manaCost
    description: The amount of mana to consume from the mana soul shard resource.
      Must be a positive integer representing the cost in mana units.
  returns: Returns true if the specified mana cost could be successfully deducted
    from the mana soul shard resource; returns false if there are insufficient resources
    to cover the requested amount.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (player->GetManaSoulShardResource()->Consume(50)) {\n    // Mana consumed\
      \ successfully\n    // Proceed with spell casting or ability usage\n} else {\n\
      \    // Not enough mana soul shards available\n    // Handle insufficient resource\
      \ case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Casting with Resource Deduction
    code: "uint32 requiredMana = 100;\nif (player->GetManaSoulShardResource()->Consume(requiredMana))\
      \ {\n    // Cast the spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Send error message to player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough mana soul shards.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ManaSoulShardResource object is properly initialized
    and accessible through the player's resource system. It does not directly interact
    with the player's visual or UI elements, but rather manages internal resource
    tracking.
  warnings: Ensure that the manaCost parameter is validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior. Calling this method without checking available resources
    may lead to inconsistent state if the system allows negative values.
