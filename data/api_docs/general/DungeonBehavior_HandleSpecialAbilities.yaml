  method: HandleSpecialAbilities
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleSpecialAbilities(Group * group, uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies special abilities for a group during a dungeon encounter.
  description: The HandleSpecialAbilities method is responsible for managing and executing
    special abilities or effects that are triggered during a dungeon encounter. This
    method takes a pointer to a Group object and an encounterId to determine which
    abilities should be applied to the group members. It likely handles mechanics
    such as cooldowns, buff/debuff application, or special NPC behaviors specific
    to the encounter. The method is typically called during encounter progression
    or when certain conditions are met within the dungeon environment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the players participating
      in the dungeon encounter. This group contains all members who will be affected
      by the special abilities.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current dungeon encounter. Used to determine
      which specific special abilities or effects should be processed and applied
      to the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Handler
    code: "void MyDungeonInstance::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    dungeonBehavior.HandleSpecialAbilities(group, encounterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::HandleSpecialAbilities(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    if (!group || encounterId == 0)\n        return;\n\n    // Apply different\
      \ abilities based on encounter ID\n    switch (encounterId)\n    {\n       \
      \ case 1:\n            // Apply debuffs to all group members\n            break;\n\
      \        case 2:\n            // Apply buffs or special effects\n          \
      \  break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger encounter management system and may
    interact with other systems such as cooldown tracking, aura application, and player
    state management. It's important to ensure that group members are valid and that
    the encounterId corresponds to a known dungeon encounter.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is not null before calling this method.
    Improper handling of encounterId values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    ability application.
