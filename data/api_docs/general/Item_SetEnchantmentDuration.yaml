documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration of an enchantment on an item.
  description: This method updates the duration of a specified enchantment slot on
    an item, typically used to modify the remaining time before an enchantment expires.
    It requires a player owner to properly update the enchantment's duration and can
    be used for various game mechanics including item durability management and enchantment
    effects. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other enchantment-related
    functions to manage item properties.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The enchantment slot to modify, typically representing the primary
      or secondary enchantment on an item.
  - name: duration
    description: The new duration value in seconds for the enchantment, which determines
      how long the enchantment will remain active before expiration.
  - name: owner
    description: The player who owns the item, required to properly update the enchantment's
      duration and ensure proper synchronization with the game state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      Player* player = new Player();

      item->SetEnchantmentDuration(EnchantmentSlot::ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_1, 3600, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: '// Example with multiple enchantments

      Item* item = new Item();

      Player* player = new Player();

      item->SetEnchantmentDuration(EnchantmentSlot::ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_2, 7200, player);

      item->SetEnchantmentDuration(EnchantmentSlot::ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_3, 14400, player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be used carefully as it affects item durability and enchantment
    mechanics. It requires proper synchronization with the player's inventory to ensure
    correct behavior. Performance considerations include potential updates to item
    state and related data structures.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause incorrect enchantment durations
    or lead to item desynchronization with the game state. The owner parameter must
    be valid and properly initialized to avoid memory issues.
