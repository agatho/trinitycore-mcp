  class: Conversation
  method: GetLineStartTime
  signature: const int * Conversation::GetLineStartTime(int locale, int lineId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the start time of a specific conversation line for the given locale.
  description: The GetLineStartTime method returns a pointer to an integer representing
    the start time of a specified conversation line in the given locale. This is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's quest and dialogue systems to determine when a particular
    line should begin playing during a conversation. The returned value represents
    a timestamp or offset in milliseconds from the start of the conversation. The
    method accesses internal conversation data structures and may return NULL if the
    line ID or locale is invalid.
  parameters:
  - name: locale
    description: The locale identifier for which to retrieve the line start time.
      This corresponds to the client's language setting (e.g., 0 for enUS, 1 for koKR,
      etc.).
  - name: lineId
    description: The unique identifier of the conversation line for which to retrieve
      the start time. This identifies a specific dialogue line within the conversation.
  returns: A const pointer to an integer representing the start time of the specified
    conversation line in milliseconds, or NULL if the line ID or locale is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve start time for a conversation line
    code: "int locale = 0; // enUS\nint lineId = 5;\nconst int* startTime = conversation->GetLineStartTime(locale,\
      \ lineId);\nif (startTime != nullptr) {\n    printf(\"Line starts at %d ms\\\
      n\", *startTime);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Invalid line or locale\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal conversation data and should only be called
    when the conversation is properly initialized. The returned pointer is valid only
    as long as the Conversation object exists and its data remains unchanged.
  warnings: Do not modify the value pointed to by the return value, as it may cause
    unexpected behavior in the conversation system. Always check for NULL before dereferencing
    the returned pointer.
