  signature: void AIDecisionTimer::RecordError(const std::string & errorMessage)
documentation:
  brief: Records an error message for AI decision timing analysis.
  description: The RecordError method logs error messages related to AI decision-making
    processes within the AIDecisionTimer class. This method is typically used to track
    issues or failures that occur during AI decision execution, such as timeouts,
    invalid states, or unexpected behavior. The recorded errors help developers diagnose
    problems in AI logic and performance tuning. The method does not return any value
    but stores the error message internally for later retrieval or reporting.
  parameters:
  - name: errorMessage
    description: A string containing the detailed error message describing what went
      wrong during AI decision processing. This should be descriptive enough to aid
      debugging and analysis of AI behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Recording
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer timer;

      timer.RecordError("AI decision timeout exceeded 500ms");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording AI Logic Error
    code: "if (decisionResult == nullptr) {\n    aiTimer->RecordError(\"Null pointer\
      \ returned from AI decision function\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe for concurrent AI processing scenarios.
    The error messages are stored in an internal buffer that may be flushed or cleared
    based on system configuration. Developers should ensure error messages are concise
    yet informative for effective debugging.
  warnings: Repeated calls to RecordError with identical messages may lead to performance
    degradation due to potential duplicate filtering mechanisms. Avoid recording extremely
    large error strings as they could impact memory usage and logging performance.
