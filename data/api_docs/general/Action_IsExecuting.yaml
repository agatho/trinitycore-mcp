documentation:
  brief: Checks if the action is currently being executed
  description: The IsExecuting method determines whether the current action instance
    is in the process of being executed. This method is typically used within AI systems
    to track the state of actions and prevent overlapping or conflicting operations.
    It returns true when the action is actively running, and false when it is idle
    or completed. In the context of TrinityCore's AI framework, this method helps
    manage action queues and ensures proper execution flow for NPC behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the action is currently executing, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (action->IsExecuting()) {\n    // Skip this action since it's already\
      \ running\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with action execution"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within an AI state machine
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (!me->IsInCombat()) {\n            if (!moveAction->IsExecuting())\
      \ {\n                moveAction->Execute();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a simple state check and has minimal
    performance overhead. It's commonly used in conjunction with action completion
    callbacks to manage execution flow.
