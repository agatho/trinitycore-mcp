documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionHouseObject instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AuctionHouseObject class is responsible for
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and releasing any held resources
    when an instance of the auction house object is destroyed. This includes removing
    references to auctions, cleaning up internal data structures, and ensuring no
    memory leaks occur during object destruction. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures proper cleanup of auction-related
    data when the auction house system is shut down or when individual auction house
    instances are removed from memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AuctionHouseObject
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject* auctionHouse = new AuctionHouseObject();

      // ... use auctionHouse ...

      delete auctionHouse; // Triggers ~AuctionHouseObject()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process
    may involve database transactions and cleanup of temporary auction data.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you are managing object lifecycle
    manually. Improper use can lead to undefined behavior, resource leaks, or crashes
    if the object is already partially destroyed.
