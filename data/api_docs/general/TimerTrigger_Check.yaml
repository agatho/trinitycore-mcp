documentation:
  brief: Checks if a timer trigger condition is met for the given AI context
  description: The Check method evaluates whether a specific timer-based trigger condition
    has been satisfied within the provided BotAI context. This method typically determines
    if enough time has elapsed since the last trigger event or if a scheduled action
    should be executed. It's commonly used in AI behavior systems to control timing
    of actions, such as when to cast spells, move to positions, or perform other timed
    activities. The method returns true if the trigger condition is met and false
    otherwise, allowing the AI system to make decisions based on temporal logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the timer trigger condition has been met (i.e., sufficient
    time has passed or the trigger criteria are satisfied), false otherwise. This
    boolean result indicates whether the AI should proceed with the associated timed
    action or behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Trigger Check
    code: "if (trigger.Check(ai)) {\n    // Execute timed action\n    ai->DoAction(ACTION_CAST_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Timer Trigger in AI Decision Making
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (timerTrigger.Check(this))\
      \ {\n        // Perform timed behavior\n        DoNextAction();\n        timerTrigger.Reset();\
      \ // Reset the timer after use\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a larger AI system where timing and scheduling
    are crucial for realistic bot behavior. The implementation likely maintains internal
    state tracking of elapsed time or event occurrences. It's important to note that
    timer triggers may be reset or reinitialized after being checked to prevent repeated
    execution of timed actions.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using timer triggers in loops or high-frequency
    update contexts, as improper handling can lead to missed triggers or excessive
    CPU usage. Ensure that the timer is properly reset after use to avoid unintended
    behavior where the same trigger fires multiple times consecutively.
