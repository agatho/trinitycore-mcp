  class: BloodBoneShieldTracker
  method: ApplyMarrowrend
  signature: void BloodBoneShieldTracker::ApplyMarrowrend(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Applies Marrowrend effect to the Blood Bone Shield tracker, increasing its
    stack count.
  description: The ApplyMarrowrend method is used to increment the stack count of
    the Blood Bone Shield buff. This method is typically invoked when the Marrowrend
    ability is applied or refreshed on a player, which enhances the effectiveness
    of the Blood Bone Shield by adding additional stacks. The method modifies internal
    state variables within the BloodBoneShieldTracker class to reflect the new stack
    level. It does not directly interact with game mechanics beyond updating the shield's
    stack count and should be called in response to specific spell effects or abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to add to the Blood Bone Shield. Valid values
      are positive integers representing the amount of Marrowrend stacks to apply.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BloodBoneShieldTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyMarrowrend(2); // Adds 2 stacks to the shield'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Effect Handler
    code: "void HandleMarrowrendSpellEffect(Unit* caster, Unit* target)\n{\n    if\
      \ (BloodBoneShieldTracker* tracker = target->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_AURA_BLOOD_BONE_SHIELD_TRACKER))\n\
      \    {\n        tracker->ApplyMarrowrend(1);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the tracker instance is properly initialized and
    valid. It's recommended to verify the existence of the Blood Bone Shield aura
    before calling this method. The implementation may internally cap stack counts
    based on game balance rules.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation might result in invalid
    state or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the stacks parameter is a positive integer
    to avoid negative stack accumulation which could lead to undefined behavior.
