  class: RoleAssignment
  method: NotifyRoleAssignment
  signature: void RoleAssignment::NotifyRoleAssignment(Player * player, GroupRole
    role, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies a player of their assigned group role and updates the group's role
    assignment state.
  description: The NotifyRoleAssignment method is responsible for informing a specific
    player about their assigned role within a group. This method typically handles
    the communication of role changes to the client, ensuring that the player's UI
    reflects their current group responsibilities. It may also update internal group
    state tracking and synchronize role information across the group members. The
    method is commonly invoked when a player joins a group or when role assignments
    are modified during gameplay. It ensures that all relevant parties are aware of
    the current role distribution for proper coordination during group activities
    such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose role assignment is being notified.
      Must be a valid player instance and member of the specified group.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value indicating the assigned role for the player.
      Valid values typically include LEADER, TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, or NONE depending
      on the game's role system implementation.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the player and defining the
      context of the role assignment. Must be a valid group instance that includes
      the specified player as a member.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment Notification
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Group* group = ...;

      GroupRole role = GROUP_ROLE_TANK;

      RoleAssignment::NotifyRoleAssignment(player, role, group);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Role in Group Context
    code: "void UpdatePlayerRole(Player* player, GroupRole newRole) {\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->IsMember(player->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n        RoleAssignment::NotifyRoleAssignment(player, newRole, group);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers UI updates on the client side to reflect role
    changes. It may also update internal data structures tracking group roles and
    could be called from various game systems such as group creation, role reassignment,
    or player joining events.
  warnings: Ensure that the player parameter is a valid member of the group before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior or access violations. The group
    parameter must not be null and should contain the player in its membership list.
