  method: GetDamage
  signature: uint32 DamageInfo::GetDamage() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total damage amount from a DamageInfo object.
  description: The GetDamage method returns the accumulated damage value stored within
    a DamageInfo instance. This method is typically used in combat-related systems
    to access the final calculated damage dealt by an attack. The returned value represents
    the actual damage points that were applied to the target, accounting for any modifiers,
    reductions, or calculations that occurred during the damage application process.
    This value is commonly used in damage logging, combat feedback, and damage-based
    event handling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total damage amount that was dealt. This
    value is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer reflecting the final calculated
    damage after all applicable modifiers have been applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerAttack(Unit* target, DamageInfo* damageInfo)\n{\n    uint32\
      \ damage = damageInfo->GetDamage();\n    if (damage > 0)\n    {\n        target->ModifyHealth(-static_cast<int32>(damage));\n\
      \        // Log the damage dealt\n        sLog->outString(\"Player dealt %u\
      \ damage to %s\", damage, target->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Damage Calculation Verification
    code: "void VerifyDamageCalculation(Unit* attacker, Unit* victim)\n{\n    DamageInfo\
      \ damageInfo;\n    // ... damage calculation logic ...\n    uint32 calculatedDamage\
      \ = damageInfo.GetDamage();\n    \n    // Ensure damage is within expected bounds\n\
      \    if (calculatedDamage > 0 && calculatedDamage <= victim->GetMaxHealth())\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Valid damage value: %u\", calculatedDamage);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outError(\"Invalid damage value: %u\"\
      , calculatedDamage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only view of the damage value. The DamageInfo
    object should be properly initialized before calling this method to ensure valid
    results. The returned value is typically set during the damage application phase
    and may include reductions from armor, resistance, or other defensive mechanisms.
  warnings: Ensure that the DamageInfo object has been properly populated with damage
    data before calling GetDamage(). Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly
    configured DamageInfo instance may result in undefined behavior. This method does
    not validate whether the returned damage value is within reasonable game bounds.
