  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: IsPossible
  signature: bool SpellInterruptAction::IsPossible(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell interrupt action can be executed by the AI bot.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if the current state allows for a spell
    interruption action to be performed. This typically checks conditions such as
    whether the bot has an active spell that can be interrupted, if the target is
    valid, and if the bot's current situation permits the interrupt. The method is
    used within the TrinityCore AI framework to ensure actions are only attempted
    when feasible, preventing invalid or harmful operations during combat or spellcasting
    sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell interrupt action can be executed under the current
    conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (spellInterruptAction.IsPossible(ai)) {\n    // Proceed with spell interruption\
      \ logic\n    ai->InterruptCurrentSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAI system and relies on internal state tracking
    of the AI's current spell casting and target status. It should be called before
    attempting to perform any spell interruption logic to avoid runtime errors or
    invalid actions.
  warnings: Do not assume that a successful IsPossible() call guarantees that the
    action will succeed in all cases, as external factors such as cooldowns or target
    changes may affect execution.
