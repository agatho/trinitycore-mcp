  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: ModifyQuestObjectives
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::ModifyQuestObjectives(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates quest objectives for a specified player in the dynamic quest system.
  description: The ModifyQuestObjectives method is responsible for adjusting or updating
    the progress of quest objectives assigned to a specific player within the dynamic
    quest system. This function likely modifies internal quest tracking data, such
    as objective completion counts or flags, based on the current state of the player's
    interactions with quest-related game elements. It may be invoked automatically
    by the system upon certain events (e.g., item collection, NPC interaction) or
    manually during quest progression handling. The method ensures that the player's
    quest log accurately reflects their current progress and updates any dependent
    systems accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest whose objectives are to be modified.
      Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose quest
      objectives will be updated. This parameter must not be null and should refer
      to an active player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: DynamicQuestSystem::ModifyQuestObjectives(12345, playerBot);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (playerBot->GetQuestStatus(12345) == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE)\n{\n \
      \   DynamicQuestSystem::ModifyQuestObjectives(12345, playerBot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the quest system upon triggering
    of objective-related events. It assumes that the provided quest ID exists and
    that the player object is valid and in a usable state. Performance considerations
    include minimizing frequent calls to avoid unnecessary database or memory overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId corresponds to an actual active quest, as calling
    this method with an invalid ID may result in undefined behavior or silent failures.
    Also, passing a null pointer for bot will likely cause a crash or assertion failure.
