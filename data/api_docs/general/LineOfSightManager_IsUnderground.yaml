  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsUnderground
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsUnderground(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is underground in the game world.
  description: The IsUnderground method checks if a specified position in the World
    of Warcraft game world is located beneath the surface, typically used to determine
    if an object or unit is inside a cave, building, or other enclosed structure.
    This method evaluates the terrain height at the given coordinates against the
    vertical position to decide if the point is considered underground. It's commonly
    used for AI pathfinding, visibility checks, and determining valid spawn locations
    within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position coordinate to check.
      This parameter likely represents a coordinate value in the game world's coordinate
      system, possibly X, Y, or Z axis depending on implementation context.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is underground (below surface level),
    false otherwise. The method evaluates whether the given coordinate falls within
    an enclosed or below-ground area of the game world terrain.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a position is underground
    code: "int position = 12345;\nif (lineOfSightManager.IsUnderground(position))\
      \ {\n    // Handle underground position\n    printf(\"Position is underground\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle surface position\n    printf(\"Position is above\
      \ ground\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs terrain height checks against the game world's
    elevation data. Implementation may involve querying the MapManager or TerrainManager
    to determine if a given coordinate is below the surface level. Performance considerations
    should be noted when checking many positions in rapid succession.
  warnings: This method assumes that the position parameter represents a valid coordinate
    within the game world's coordinate system. Invalid coordinates could lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. The method may not account for dynamic terrain
    changes during runtime.
