  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ShouldBuyItem(::Player * bot, uint32 itemId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player should purchase a specific item based on
    inventory and economy logic.
  description: The ShouldBuyItem method evaluates if a given bot player should acquire
    a particular item. It considers factors such as the player's current inventory
    capacity, available currency, item value, and potential utility within the bot's
    decision-making framework. This method is typically used in automated trading
    or purchasing behaviors for AI-controlled characters. The evaluation logic may
    involve checking item restrictions, vendor availability, and economic balance
    to prevent overstocking or unnecessary spending.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is evaluating
      whether to buy an item.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item being considered for purchase. Must
      correspond to a valid entry in the game's item database.
  returns: Returns true if the bot should proceed with purchasing the specified item;
    otherwise, returns false. The decision is based on internal logic that assesses
    inventory space, gold balance, and item relevance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (validator.ShouldBuyItem(bot, 12345)) {\n    bot->BuyItemFromVendor(12345);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Purchase Logic
    code: "uint32 itemId = 67890;\nif (validator.ShouldBuyItem(bot, itemId) && bot->GetMoney()\
      \ > 10000) {\n    bot->BuyItemFromVendor(itemId);\n    // Additional logic for\
      \ post-purchase actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot economy systems and may be
    influenced by configuration settings such as maximum inventory limits or preferred
    item categories. It assumes that the provided Player object is valid and properly
    initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player has sufficient gold before calling this method,
    as it does not perform currency checks itself. Also, note that itemId must exist
    in the game's database; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
