  class: MovementValidator
  method: ResetStuckCounter
  signature: void MovementValidator::ResetStuckCounter(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the stuck counter for a specified player bot.
  description: The ResetStuckCounter method clears or resets the internal stuck detection
    counter associated with a given player bot. This is typically used during movement
    validation to prevent false positives when a bot appears stuck but is actually
    navigating through complex terrain or waiting for pathfinding results. The method
    ensures that the bot's movement state is properly reset so it can continue normal
    operation without being incorrectly flagged as stuck.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose stuck counter
      should be reset. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MovementValidator validator;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      validator.ResetStuckCounter(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MovementValidator class and is typically invoked
    during bot behavior updates or after movement corrections to ensure accurate stuck
    detection logic.
