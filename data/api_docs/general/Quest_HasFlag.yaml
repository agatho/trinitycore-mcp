    whether a quest is daily, repeatable, or requires specific conditions to be met.
    The method returns true if the specified flag is present in the quest's flags,
    false otherwise. This functionality is essential for quest system logic and helps
    determine quest eligibility based on various criteria.

    carefully to ensure proper flag checking. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight
    operation that does not involve any database calls or complex computations.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with different flag combinations; incorrect
    flag usage may lead to incorrect quest eligibility checks or logic errors in quest
    progression.
