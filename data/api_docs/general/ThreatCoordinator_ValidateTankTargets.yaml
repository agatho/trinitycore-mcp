  method: ValidateTankTargets
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::ValidateTankTargets()
documentation:
  brief: Validates and updates the list of valid tank targets for threat management
    in the ThreatCoordinator system.
  description: The ValidateTankTargets method ensures that all currently assigned
    tank targets within the ThreatCoordinator are still valid and eligible for threat
    generation. This method typically checks if the target units are alive, within
    range, and not flagged as invalid or untargetable by game mechanics. It is part
    of the core threat management system used by AI-controlled creatures to maintain
    proper targeting and threat distribution among multiple targets. The method performs
    internal validation logic that may involve checking unit states, combat status,
    and other conditions that determine whether a target should remain in the active
    tank target list.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_ThreatCoordinator)\n        m_ThreatCoordinator->ValidateTankTargets();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when threat changes
    occur. It may trigger internal cleanup of invalid targets and could potentially
    modify the internal state of the ThreatCoordinator. The validation process might
    involve checking unit health, visibility, and other combat-related flags.
  warnings: Calling this method inappropriately or too frequently without proper context
    may cause performance degradation or unexpected behavior in threat management.
    It should only be invoked when necessary for maintaining valid target lists.
