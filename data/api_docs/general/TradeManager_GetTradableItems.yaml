  class: TradeManager
  method: GetTradableItems
  signature: int TradeManager::GetTradableItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of items currently available for trade in the trade manager's
    inventory.
  description: The GetTradableItems method returns an integer representing the total
    number of items that are eligible for trading within the TradeManager's context.
    This typically includes items that are not bound, are in a tradable state, and
    meet the requirements for being offered in a trade session. The method does not
    perform any side effects or modify internal state; it simply enumerates and counts
    the tradable items. It is commonly used during trade initialization to determine
    how many items can be offered by a player or NPC.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the number of tradable items currently available
    in the TradeManager's inventory. Returns zero if no items are tradable or if the
    trade manager has no items at all.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Tradable Items
    code: "int tradableItemCount = tradeManager.GetTradableItems();\nif (tradableItemCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with trade logic\n    std::cout << \"Player has \"\
      \ << tradableItemCount << \" items available for trade.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a trade
    session to determine how many items can be offered. It may internally filter out
    items that are soulbound, account-bound, or otherwise restricted from trading.
