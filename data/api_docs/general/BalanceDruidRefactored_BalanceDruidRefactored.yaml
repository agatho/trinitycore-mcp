documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Balance Druid AI bot with the specified player context
  description: The BalanceDruidRefactored constructor initializes a new instance of
    the BalanceDruidRefactored class, setting up the AI behavior for a druid player
    specializing in balance magic. This method configures the bot's spell selection,
    combat strategies, and resource management based on the player's current state
    and available abilities. The initialization process includes setting up target
    selection logic, determining optimal spell usage sequences, and establishing the
    bot's overall gameplay approach for balance druid specialization.

  - title: Basic Balance Druid Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      BalanceDruidRefactored druidBot(bot);

      // The bot is now initialized with balance druid AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The player
    parameter must not be null and should represent a valid druid character with appropriate
    spell knowledge. The initialization process may take several milliseconds depending
    on the complexity of the AI implementation.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor multiple times on the same bot instance as
    it may cause memory leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that the player object
    remains valid throughout the lifetime of the BalanceDruidRefactored instance.
