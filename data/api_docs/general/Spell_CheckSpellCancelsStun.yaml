documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the spell cancels stun effects
  description: This method determines if a spell has the ability to remove or cancel
    stun effects from the target. It is commonly used in spell handling logic to identify
    spells that can break stun status, such as those that provide immunity against
    stun effects or have specific mechanics for removing the effect. The method evaluates
    whether the spell's effect is capable of breaking the stun condition and returns
    true if it does so, otherwise false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell cancels stun effects, false otherwise. The return
    value indicates whether the spell has the capability to remove stun status from
    targets.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->CheckSpellCancelsStun()) {\n    // Spell can break stun\n  \
      \  // Do something here\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell evaluation
    functions to determine the complete effect of a spell on target status. It may
    be part of larger spell handling logic and should be used carefully when determining
    spell effects.
  warnings: This method only checks if the spell cancels stun, not whether it actually
    applies the effect. Care must be taken when using this method in conjunction with
    other spell mechanics to avoid incorrect assumptions about spell behavior.
