  class: MageAI
  method: UseArcaneExplosion
  signature: void MageAI::UseArcaneExplosion(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Arcane Explosion spell based on the number of nearby enemies.
  description: The UseArcaneExplosion method is responsible for casting the Arcane
    Explosion spell in the MageAI class. This method determines whether to cast the
    spell based on the number of enemies within range, typically used during combat
    situations. The spell deals arcane damage to all enemies in front of the caster
    and is a core part of the mage's damage rotation. It evaluates the enemy count
    parameter to decide if the spell should be cast, ensuring optimal resource usage
    and damage output.
  parameters:
  - name: enemies
    description: The number of enemies currently in the caster's vicinity. This value
      determines whether Arcane Explosion will be cast, as the spell is typically
      used when multiple enemies are present to maximize its damage potential.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void SomeMageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Assume we have\
      \ a method to count enemies\n    int enemyCount = GetEnemyCount();\n    UseArcaneExplosion(enemyCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Casting
    code: "void MageAI::UseArcaneExplosion(const int& enemies)\n{\n    if (enemies\
      \ >= 3) // Only cast if 3 or more enemies are present\n    {\n        // Cast\
      \ Arcane Explosion\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_ARCANE_EXPLOSION);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the AI's combat decision-making
    process. The spell should only be cast when there are sufficient enemies to benefit
    from its area-of-effect damage. Consideration should be given to cooldowns and
    mana costs when implementing this logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the enemy count parameter accurately reflects the number of
    valid targets in the caster's line of sight. Improper enemy detection may lead
    to incorrect spell usage or casting in inappropriate situations.
