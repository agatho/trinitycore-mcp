  method: IsBagsFull
  signature: bool InventoryManager::IsBagsFull() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if all inventory bags are full and cannot accommodate additional items.
  description: The IsBagsFull method determines whether the player's inventory bags
    have reached their maximum capacity. It evaluates all equipped bags, including
    the main backpack and any additional bag slots, to verify if there are no available
    free slots for new items. This method is commonly used in item management systems,
    trade operations, and quest completion checks where inventory space is critical.
    The check includes both the main bag and all possible bag slots that can be equipped
    by the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all bags are completely full with no free slots available
    for new items; returns false if at least one slot is available in any of the bags.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inventory Check
    code: "if (player->GetInventory()->IsBagsFull()) {\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Your inventory is full.\");\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with adding item\
      \ to inventory"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Item Pickup
    code: "void Player::HandleItemPickup(Item* item) {\n    if (GetInventory()->IsBagsFull())\
      \ {\n        SendNotification(\"Cannot pick up item: Inventory full.\");\n \
      \       return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with item pickup logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method considers all bag slots including the main backpack and any additional
    bags that may be equipped. It does not account for temporary inventory modifications
    or items that might be moved during a transaction. The check is performed at the
    time of calling and reflects the current state of the inventory.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator for item placement
    decisions in high-frequency operations, as it may cause performance overhead if
    called excessively. Additionally, it does not consider quest items or special
    inventory slots that might have different capacity rules.
