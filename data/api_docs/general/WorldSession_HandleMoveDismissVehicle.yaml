documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to dismiss or exit a vehicle.
  description: The HandleMoveDismissVehicle method processes a packet sent by the
    client when a player attempts to exit their current vehicle. This method is part
    of the WorldSession class and is responsible for managing the logic associated
    with vehicle dismissal, including updating the player's position, removing the
    vehicle seat assignment, and sending necessary updates to the client. The method
    ensures that the player is properly ejected from the vehicle and returns them
    to normal movement state. It typically occurs when a player presses the dismount
    key or uses an in-game command to leave their vehicle.

  - title: Basic Vehicle Dismissal Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveDismissVehicle(WorldPackets::Vehicle::MoveDismissVehicle&\
      \ moveDismissVehicle)\n{\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player\
      \ || !player->IsInWorld())\n        return;\n\n    // Process vehicle dismissal\
      \ logic here\n    player->ExitVehicle();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the packet handling system in
    TrinityCore. It relies on the player's current vehicle state and must ensure proper
    synchronization between client and server states. The method may also trigger
    additional events or updates related to player movement and positioning.
