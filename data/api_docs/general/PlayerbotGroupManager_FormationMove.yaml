  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: FormationMove
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::FormationMove(uint32 groupId, const int &
    destination)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player bot group to a specified destination using formation movement
    mechanics.
  description: The FormationMove method orchestrates the movement of a designated
    player bot group to a given destination coordinate. This function is typically
    used in AI-driven group management systems within TrinityCore's playerbot framework,
    where bots need to maintain specific formations while navigating the game world.
    The method likely handles pathfinding, group coordination, and ensures that individual
    bot movements align with overall group positioning. It operates on the assumption
    that the group has been properly initialized and that the destination coordinate
    is valid within the game environment.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the player bot group to be moved. Must correspond
      to an existing group in the system.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to the destination coordinate (likely x, y, z) where the
      group should move. The value represents a target location in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Formation Movement
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      uint32 groupId = 1;

      int destination[3] = {100, 200, 300};

      groupMgr->FormationMove(groupId, destination);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot AI system and assumes that the group
    manager has been initialized with valid bot groups. The destination parameter
    should be a valid coordinate within the game world boundaries.
