  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: CalculateMomentum
  signature: float MarketAnalysis::CalculateMomentum(const int & prices)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the momentum value based on the provided price data
    for market analysis.
  description: The CalculateMomentum method computes a momentum indicator using historical
    price data to assess the strength and direction of a market trend. This implementation
    takes a reference to an integer representing price data and returns a floating-point
    value that quantifies the rate of change in price over time. The method is typically
    used within the MarketAnalysis class for evaluating market dynamics and making
    informed trading decisions. It assumes valid price data input and may perform
    internal calculations such as moving averages or difference ratios to determine
    momentum.
  parameters:
  - name: prices
    description: A constant reference to an integer representing the price data used
      for momentum calculation. This parameter should contain valid numerical price
      values that reflect market conditions.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated momentum. Positive values
    indicate upward momentum, while negative values suggest downward momentum. A value
    near zero implies a lack of significant trend direction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Momentum Calculation
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      int currentPrice = 100;

      float momentum = analyzer.CalculateMomentum(currentPrice);

      // Returns the momentum value based on price data

      std::cout << "Momentum: " << momentum << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger market analysis framework and may be used
    in conjunction with other financial indicators. The accuracy of the result depends
    heavily on the quality and relevance of the input price data.
  warnings: Ensure that the input 'prices' parameter contains valid numerical values
    to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect momentum calculations. This method does
    not validate input parameters beyond basic type checking.
