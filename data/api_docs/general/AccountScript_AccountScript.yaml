  class: AccountScript
  method: AccountScript
  signature: void AccountScript::AccountScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an AccountScript instance with a specified name for event handling
    and scripting integration.
  description: The AccountScript constructor initializes a new account script instance
    with the provided name. This method is typically used within TrinityCore's scripting
    system to register custom account-related behaviors and events. The name parameter
    serves as a unique identifier for the script, allowing the game server to distinguish
    between different account scripts. During initialization, the script may register
    callbacks for various account-related events such as login, logout, or account
    modifications. This constructor is part of the broader scripting framework that
    enables developers to extend core game functionality through custom C++ implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique name identifier
      for this account script. This name is used internally by TrinityCore to manage
      and dispatch events to the correct script instance. The name should be descriptive
      and unique within the context of your server's scripting system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AccountScript Initialization
    code: "class MyAccountScript : public AccountScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyAccountScript()\
      \ : AccountScript(\"MyCustomAccountScript\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: AccountScript with Event Registration
    code: "class LoginEventScript : public AccountScript\n{\npublic:\n    LoginEventScript()\
      \ : AccountScript(\"LoginEventHandler\")\n    {\n        // Script would register\
      \ for login events here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or script loading
    phases. The name parameter must be a valid, non-null string. AccountScript instances
    are managed by the TrinityCore scripting system and should not be manually deleted
    unless explicitly handled by the script manager. The initialization process may
    involve registering the script with internal event systems.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly from game logic or in performance-critical
    sections. Ensure that the name parameter is unique to prevent conflicts with other
    scripts. Improperly named scripts may cause event dispatching issues or unexpected
    behavior in account-related functionality.
