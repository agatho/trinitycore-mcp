  method: GetForceDisabledNavMeshFilterFlags
  signature: uint16 Map::GetForceDisabledNavMeshFilterFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the force disabled navigation mesh filter flags for the map.
  description: This method retrieves the set of flags that determine which navigation
    mesh filters are forcibly disabled on the map. The returned value represents a
    bitmask where each bit corresponds to a specific filter type that has been disabled.
    This is used primarily in the context of World of Warcraft's navigation mesh system,
    where certain filters may be disabled to prevent pathfinding issues or to enforce
    specific gameplay mechanics. The method is typically called during map initialization
    or when processing navigation mesh data to ensure proper filtering behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the bitmask of disabled navigation
    mesh filter flags. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific filter
    type that has been forcibly disabled, allowing for precise control over which
    filters are active or inactive during pathfinding operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint16 disabledFlags = map->GetForceDisabledNavMeshFilterFlags();\nif (disabledFlags\
      \ & NavMeshFilterFlags::F_FLAG_1)\n    // Handle disabled filter 1\nelse\n \
      \   // Handle enabled filter 1"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during map initialization or when processing
    navigation mesh data. The returned flags are set based on configuration settings
    and may vary between different map instances. Performance considerations include
    the use of bitwise operations to check individual flags, which should be efficient
    but can become a bottleneck if many flags need to be checked.
  warnings: This method should not be used in contexts where navigation mesh data
    is being actively modified or where the flags are expected to change dynamically
    during runtime. The returned value represents static configuration and may not
    reflect real-time changes in filter status.
