  brief: Enables the player to gain rested experience from spell effects.
  description: The EffectGiveRestedExperience method allows a spell to grant rested
    experience to the player, which is typically used in conjunction with the Resting
    mechanic in World of Warcraft. This method facilitates the accumulation of rested
    experience points that can be applied to the player's character when they enter
    a state of rest. It usually involves calculating and applying the appropriate
    amount of rested experience based on the spell's effect properties and the player's
    current resting status.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectGiveRestedExperience()\n{\n    // Implementation details\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell execution when a player enters
    resting state, and the implementation requires careful handling of experience
    calculations to ensure proper application of rested XP.
  warnings: Improper implementation may lead to incorrect experience calculations
    or failure to apply rested XP correctly. Ensure that the spell's effect is properly
    configured for resting mechanics.
