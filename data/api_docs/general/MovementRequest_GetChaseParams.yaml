  class: MovementRequest
  method: GetChaseParams
  signature: const ChaseMovementParams & MovementRequest::GetChaseParams() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the chase movement parameters associated with this movement request.
  description: The GetChaseParams method provides access to the chase movement parameters
    that define how a unit should pursue a target. These parameters typically include
    distance thresholds, speed adjustments, and behavior flags that control the chasing
    mechanics. The returned reference points to internal data within the MovementRequest
    object, so modifications to the returned structure will affect the original request.
    This method is commonly used in AI logic to determine pursuit behavior for NPCs
    or player-controlled units.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the ChaseMovementParams structure that contains
    all chase-related movement configuration settings for this request.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Chase Parameters for AI Logic
    code: "void MyAI::Update()\n{\n    if (auto params = m_movementRequest.GetChaseParams();\
      \ params.IsValid())\n    {\n        // Use chase parameters to adjust movement\
      \ behavior\n        float distance = params.GetMaxDistance();\n        float\
      \ speed = params.GetSpeedMultiplier();\n        // Apply logic based on chase\
      \ settings\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Chase Parameters Before Initiating Chase
    code: "bool Unit::CanInitiateChase()\n{\n    const auto& params = m_movementRequest.GetChaseParams();\n\
      \    \n    // Validate that chase parameters are reasonable\n    if (params.GetMaxDistance()\
      \ <= 0.0f || params.GetMinDistance() < 0.0f)\n        return false;\n    \n\
      \    // Proceed with chase logic\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference is valid only as long as the MovementRequest object
    exists and has not been modified. This method does not perform any validation
    on the parameters, so callers should ensure that the returned structure contains
    valid values before using them in gameplay logic.
  warnings: Modifying the returned ChaseMovementParams structure directly will modify
    the internal state of the MovementRequest object. If multiple systems are accessing
    the same movement request, changes may cause unexpected behavior. Always verify
    parameter validity before using values from the returned structure.
