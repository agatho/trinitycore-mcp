  method: PublishEvent
  signature: bool NPCEventBus::PublishEvent(const NPCEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes an NPC event to all registered subscribers in the event bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a given NPCEvent to all registered
    listeners within the NPCEventBus. This mechanism allows for decoupled communication
    between different parts of the game logic, enabling systems such as quest triggers,
    AI behavior modifications, or environmental changes to notify interested components
    without direct coupling. The method returns true if the event was successfully
    published to at least one subscriber, and false otherwise. It is typically used
    in scenarios where an NPC's state changes or an event occurs that other systems
    need to react to.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the event was successfully delivered to one or more subscribers;
    false if no subscribers were registered or the event could not be published.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Publishing
    code: "NPCEvent event;\nevent.type = NPC_EVENT_TYPE_QUEST_ACCEPTED;\nevent.data.questId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool success = eventBus.PublishEvent(event);\nif (success)\n{\n\
      \    // Event was published successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
    The event bus maintains a list of subscribers that are notified synchronously
    upon publishing an event. Performance may degrade if too many subscribers are
    registered or if events are published very frequently.
  warnings: Do not modify the event data after calling PublishEvent, as it might lead
    to race conditions if the event is being processed by multiple threads simultaneously.
