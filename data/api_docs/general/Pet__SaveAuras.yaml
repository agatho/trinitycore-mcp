  class: Pet
  method: _SaveAuras
  signature: void Pet::_SaveAuras(int trans)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the pet's auras to the database with the specified transaction.
  description: The _SaveAuras method persists all active aura effects of the pet to
    the database using the provided database transaction. This method is typically
    invoked during pet saving operations, such as when a pet is dismissed, summoned,
    or when the game state is being saved. It ensures that the pet's temporary buffs,
    debuffs, and other aura-based effects are properly stored so they can be restored
    upon future loading. The method operates within the context of a database transaction
    to maintain data consistency and prevent partial updates.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: The database transaction identifier used for saving the aura data.
      This parameter ensures that all related database operations are grouped together
      and committed atomically.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Saving Pet Auras with Transaction
    code: "void SavePetAuras(Pet* pet)\n{\n    TransactionType trans = sDatabase->BeginTransaction();\n\
      \    pet->_SaveAuras(trans);\n    sDatabase->CommitTransaction(trans);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal implementation detail and should not be called
    directly by external code. It assumes that the provided transaction is valid and
    properly initialized. The method does not handle error recovery or rollback; it
    relies on the caller to manage transaction lifecycle.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid database transaction may result in
    data inconsistency or corruption. Do not invoke this method outside of controlled
    save contexts such as pet dismissal or server shutdown routines.
