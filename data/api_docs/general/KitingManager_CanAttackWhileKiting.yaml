  class: KitingManager
  method: CanAttackWhileKiting
  signature: bool KitingManager::CanAttackWhileKiting()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is allowed to attack while kiting.
  description: The CanAttackWhileKiting method evaluates if a player can perform an
    attack action while actively kiting. This functionality is crucial for handling
    game mechanics related to player movement and combat interactions, particularly
    in scenarios where kiting (moving while attacking) may be restricted or allowed
    based on player state, class abilities, or game rules. The method typically checks
    internal flags or states within the KitingManager to determine if kiting and attacking
    are compatible at the current moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is permitted to attack while kiting; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates whether the current kiting state allows for combat
    actions without interrupting the kiting movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetKitingManager()->CanAttackWhileKiting()) {\n    // Allow\
      \ player to attack while kiting\n    player->Attack(target);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Player cannot attack while kiting, stop kiting or interrupt action\n  \
      \  player->StopKiting();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in combat logic to enforce game rules around kiting
    and attacking. It may be called frequently during combat updates, so performance
    should be considered for high-frequency calls.
