  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::ListMaterialOnAuction(int * player, uint32
    itemGuid, const MaterialStockpileConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Lists materials available for auction based on player input and configuration
    settings.
  description: The ListMaterialOnAuction method retrieves and displays material items
    that are currently available for auction within the game's profession system.
    It takes a player reference, an item GUID, and a configuration object to determine
    which materials should be listed. This function is typically used in conjunction
    with auction house mechanics where players can list their crafted materials or
    resources for sale. The method ensures proper validation of inputs and applies
    the specified material stockpile configuration to filter results appropriately.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to identify which player's materials are being
      queried for auction.
  - name: itemGuid
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the globally unique identifier
      of a specific item. This GUID identifies the particular material item to be
      listed on auction.
  - name: config
    description: Reference to a MaterialStockpileConfig object that contains settings
      and filters for determining which materials should be included in the auction
      listing. This includes parameters like minimum quantity, quality thresholds,
      and other stockpile-related configurations.
  returns: Returns true if the material was successfully listed on auction according
    to the provided configuration; otherwise returns false if there was an error or
    invalid input.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 itemGuid = 67890;\nMaterialStockpileConfig\
      \ config;\nconfig.minQuantity = 10;\nconfig.maxQuality = 3;\nbool result = bridge->ListMaterialOnAuction(&playerId,\
      \ itemGuid, config);\nif (result) {\n    // Material successfully listed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Configuration Example
    code: "int playerId = 54321;\nuint32 itemGuid = 98765;\nMaterialStockpileConfig\
      \ config;\nconfig.minQuantity = 50;\nconfig.maxQuality = 5;\nconfig.excludeBlacklisted\
      \ = true;\nconfig.includeCraftedOnly = false;\nbool result = bridge->ListMaterialOnAuction(&playerId,\
      \ itemGuid, config);\nif (!result) {\n    // Handle error case\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to list material on auction\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction house data structures
    and may require synchronization locks depending on implementation. The MaterialStockpileConfig
    object should be properly initialized before calling this function to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and points to a legitimate player
    GUID. Passing an invalid itemGuid or improperly configured config object may lead
    to unexpected results or errors in the auction listing process.
