documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes mana regeneration bonus to the player's mana regen rate.
  description: This method modifies the player's mana regeneration rate by applying
    or removing a specified bonus amount. It is used internally by TrinityCore to
    manage various game mechanics such as mana regeneration buffs, debuffs, and special
    effects that influence how quickly a player's mana replenishes over time. The
    method can be called with positive or negative values to increase or decrease
    the mana regen rate respectively, and is typically used in conjunction with other
    mana-related functions to maintain game balance and player experience.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of mana regeneration bonus to apply or remove. Positive
      values increase mana regeneration rate, negative values decrease it.
  - name: apply
    description: If true, the bonus is applied; if false, the bonus is removed. This
      parameter determines whether the effect is active or inactive.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply mana regen bonus
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ApplyManaRegenBonus(100, true);

      // Applies 100 mana regeneration bonus to the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove mana regen bonus
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ApplyManaRegenBonus(-50, false);

      // Removes 50 mana regeneration bonus from the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other mana-related methods
    like ApplyManaRegenBonus and should be called carefully to avoid unintended side
    effects. It may be used internally by TrinityCore when applying buffs or debuffs
    that affect mana regeneration rates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect mana regeneration rates,
    potentially affecting gameplay balance and player experience. This method should
    not be used directly without proper context from the game mechanics being implemented.
