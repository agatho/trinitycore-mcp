documentation:
  brief: Sets a known title for the player at the specified index.
  description: This method allows setting a specific known title for a player character,
    which is used in conjunction with the player's title system. The method takes
    an index and a mask value to determine which title to set. Titles are typically
    related to achievements or reputation rewards that players can unlock and display.
    This method is part of the broader title management system within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The index position in the known titles array where the title should
      be set. Valid values are typically between 0-127, representing different title
      slots.
  - name: mask
    description: The bitmask value that represents the title to be set. This is usually
      a 64-bit value representing a specific title or titles in the player's known
      titles list.

  examples:
  - title: Setting a known title
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetKnownTitle(0, 1ULL << 5);

      // Sets the first title to be the one corresponding to bit 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be used when managing known titles in a controlled
    manner. The player's title system is complex and requires understanding of how
    titles are stored and retrieved.
