documentation:
  brief: Compares two UnitChannel objects for inequality
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this UnitChannel
    instance and another UnitChannel object to determine if they are not equal. This
    comparison is typically based on the internal state or identifier of the channel,
    such as the spell ID or target GUID. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    UnitChannel objects represent ongoing channeling spells cast by units, and this
    operator allows developers to check whether two channeling states differ. The
    method returns true if the channels are different and false if they are identical.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current UnitChannel object is not equal to the provided
    right UnitChannel object; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check between two channel objects
    code: "UnitChannel* channel1 = unit->GetChannel();\nUnitChannel* channel2 = target->GetChannel();\n\
      if (*channel1 != *channel2)\n{\n    // Channels are different\n    // Handle\
      \ accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal identifiers or spell data to determine
    equality. It is commonly used in spell management and channeling logic within
    the TrinityCore server codebase.
