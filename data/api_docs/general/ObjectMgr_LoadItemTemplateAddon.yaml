documentation:
  brief: Loads item template addon data from the database into memory for use during
    runtime.
  description: The LoadItemTemplateAddon method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with additional item template information retrieved from the database.
    This includes data such as item enchantments, random properties, and other extended
    attributes that are not part of the base item template but are required for proper
    gameplay mechanics. The method is typically called during server startup or when
    reloading item templates to ensure all addon data is synchronized with the current
    database state. It performs database queries to fetch relevant addon records and
    processes them into efficient in-memory structures for fast lookup during item
    creation, modification, and usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadItemTemplates()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadItemTemplateAddon();\n\
      \    // Other template loading logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup sequence and should
    not be called repeatedly during runtime unless item templates are being reloaded.
    The method performs database I/O operations which may cause temporary performance
    impact. It's important to ensure that the database connection is valid and that
    required tables contain proper data before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method while items are actively being used or modified in
    the game world can lead to inconsistent behavior. Avoid invoking it during high-traffic
    periods or when players are actively engaged with items. The method assumes all
    necessary database tables exist and contain valid data, otherwise it may cause
    crashes or undefined behavior.
