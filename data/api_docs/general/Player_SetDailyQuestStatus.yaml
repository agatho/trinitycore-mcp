documentation:
  brief: Sets the daily quest status for a player.
  description: This method updates the status of a specified daily quest for the player,
    marking it as completed or resetting it to its initial state. It is used primarily
    in conjunction with daily quest completion mechanics and can be called when a
    player finishes a daily quest or when the daily quest needs to be reset. The method
    ensures that the player's daily quest tracking system properly reflects the current
    state of the quest.
  parameters:
  - name: quest_id
    description: The unique identifier of the daily quest to set status for. This
      must be a valid quest ID that exists in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Daily Quest Status
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDailyQuestStatus(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other daily quest related
    methods and should be called when the player's daily quest status needs to be
    updated. It does not directly handle quest completion or reward distribution,
    but rather updates the internal tracking of the quest.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method as it may affect the player's
    quest log and could potentially cause issues if used incorrectly with non-daily
    quests or without proper validation.
