  brief: Loads player talents information from database
  description: This method retrieves and initializes player talent data from the database,
    ensuring that all talent points are properly allocated and that the player's talent
    trees are correctly set up. The method handles the loading of talent information
    for each talent tree, including the number of points spent in each talent, and
    ensures that the player's talents are synchronized with the database state. It
    is typically called during player initialization or when relogging to ensure proper
    talent distribution.

    code: "void LoadTalents(int result)\n{\n    // Implementation would load talents\
      \ from database\n    // This method is called during player initialization\n\
      }\nPlayer* player = new Player();\nplayer->_LoadTalents(0);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is fully initialized and
    ready to receive talent data. It may cause issues if called before the player's
    character data is loaded from database.
