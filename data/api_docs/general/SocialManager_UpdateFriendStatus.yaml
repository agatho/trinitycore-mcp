  brief: Updates the status of a friend in the social manager
  description: The UpdateFriendStatus method is responsible for refreshing or synchronizing
    the online/offline status of a friend within the SocialManager system. This method
    ensures that the player's friend list accurately reflects whether each friend
    is currently logged into the game, and may also update related information such
    as last seen time or location. It typically gets invoked when a friend logs in,
    logs out, or when the social manager needs to refresh its internal state. The
    method operates on the internal data structures of the SocialManager without requiring
    explicit parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->UpdateFriendStatus();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called automatically by the core system when friend
    status changes occur. Developers should not need to call this manually unless
    implementing custom social behavior or debugging.
