  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetFollowTarget
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::SetFollowTarget(Player * leader)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target player to follow for the leader-follower behavior.
  description: The SetFollowTarget method assigns a specific player as the target
    for following behavior within the LeaderFollowBehavior class. This method is typically
    used in AI systems where one creature or player needs to follow another entity.
    The method validates that the provided target is a valid Player object and updates
    internal state accordingly. It returns true if the target was successfully set,
    and false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters or other constraints.
    This functionality is commonly used in group mechanics, quest systems, or custom
    AI logic where entities must maintain a following relationship.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will serve as the follow target.
      Must be a valid Player instance; null pointers will result in failure.
  returns: Returns true if the follow target was successfully set and validated, false
    otherwise. Failure conditions include passing a null pointer or invalid player
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get reference to player\nbool success =\
      \ behavior.SetFollowTarget(targetPlayer);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Follow target\
      \ set successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = nullptr;\nbool result = behavior.SetFollowTarget(targetPlayer);\n\
      if (!result)\n{\n    // Handle failure case - possibly log error or notify user\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to set follow target\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the caller has already validated that the provided Player
    object is in a valid state and within the game world. The internal implementation
    likely updates tracking variables, AI states, or movement behaviors. Performance
    impact is minimal as it primarily involves pointer assignment and basic validation.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will result in failure and may cause
    unexpected behavior in the AI system. Ensure that all Player pointers passed are
    valid before calling this method. Avoid calling this method during critical sections
    of AI execution to prevent race conditions.
