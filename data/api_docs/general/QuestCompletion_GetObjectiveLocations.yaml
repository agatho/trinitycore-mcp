  class: QuestCompletion
  method: GetObjectiveLocations
  signature: int QuestCompletion::GetObjectiveLocations(const QuestObjectiveData &
    objective)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the location coordinates for a specified quest objective.
  description: The GetObjectiveLocations method retrieves the geographical coordinates
    associated with a given quest objective. This function is typically used during
    quest progression to determine where players need to go or what locations they
    should interact with. The method takes a QuestObjectiveData object as input which
    contains information about the specific objective, and returns an integer representing
    the number of location points found for that objective. It's commonly used in
    conjunction with quest tracking systems and UI elements that display objective
    markers on the map.
  parameters:
  - name: objective
    description: A const reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the quest objective for which locations are being retrieved.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of location coordinates found
    for the specified quest objective. A return value of 0 indicates no locations
    were found, while positive values indicate the count of valid location points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "QuestObjectiveData objective;\n// ... populate objective data ...\nint\
      \ numLocations = questCompletion->GetObjectiveLocations(objective);\nif (numLocations\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the locations\n    printf(\"Found %d locations for\
      \ this objective\\n\", numLocations);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of quest system implementation
    and may be called during quest update events or when displaying quest objectives
    on the map. The method assumes that the QuestObjectiveData parameter has been
    properly initialized with valid quest objective information.
  warnings: Ensure that the QuestObjectiveData object passed to this method contains
    valid data, as invalid or uninitialized data could lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect location retrieval results.
