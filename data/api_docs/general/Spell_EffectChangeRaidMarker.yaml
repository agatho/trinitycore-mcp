  signature: void Spell::EffectChangeRaidMarker()
documentation:
  brief: Changes the raid marker assigned to a target during spell effect execution.
  description: This method modifies the raid marker assignment for a target during
    spell effect processing. It typically occurs when a spell requires the player
    to mark a target with a specific raid marker (such as 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D').
    The method ensures that the correct marker is applied to the target based on the
    spell's requirements, and may involve updating the target's marker state within
    the game world. This functionality is commonly used in raid encounters where players
    need to mark targets for specific mechanics or strategies.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void Spell::EffectChangeRaidMarker() {\n    // Implementation would update\
      \ target's raid marker\n    // based on spell requirements\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details may vary depending on the specific spell and target
    type. This method likely interacts with the game world to ensure proper marker
    assignment, and may require synchronization with other systems such as raid management
    or target selection.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly outside of spell effect processing
    contexts; improper usage could lead to incorrect marker assignments or game state
    issues.
