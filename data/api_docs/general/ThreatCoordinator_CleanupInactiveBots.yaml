documentation:
  brief: Removes inactive bot entries from the threat coordinator's tracking system.
  description: The CleanupInactiveBots method is responsible for identifying and removing
    bot entries that have been inactive for a specified period from the ThreatCoordinator's
    internal tracking structures. This ensures that the threat management system does
    not maintain references to bots that are no longer relevant or active in combat
    scenarios. The method typically iterates through tracked bot entries, checks their
    activity status or last update timestamps, and removes those that exceed the defined
    inactivity threshold. This cleanup process helps maintain optimal performance
    and accuracy of threat calculations within the AI system.

  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the AI subsystem to maintain
    clean tracking data. It may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety
    during cleanup operations. The inactivity threshold for bots is usually configurable
    and depends on game settings or AI behavior parameters.
