  method: ConsumeProc
  signature: void FrostKillingMachineTracker::ConsumeProc()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a proc from the Frost Killing Machine tracker, decrementing its
    active proc counter.
  description: The ConsumeProc method is responsible for handling the consumption
    of a proc event within the Frost Killing Machine tracker system. This method typically
    reduces an internal counter or state that tracks how many procs are available
    or remaining. It may be invoked when a player's Frost Killing Machine weapon effect
    triggers, consuming one of its available procs to apply its damage or buff mechanics.
    The method does not return any value and is generally used as part of the game's
    combat system logic for tracking consumable effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "FrostKillingMachineTracker* tracker = player->GetFrostKillingMachineTracker();\n\
      if (tracker && tracker->HasProcs()) {\n    tracker->ConsumeProc();\n    // Apply\
      \ frost damage or effect here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during combat events when a proc from the Frost
    Killing Machine weapon is triggered. It's important to ensure that the tracker
    object is valid and has procs available before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
