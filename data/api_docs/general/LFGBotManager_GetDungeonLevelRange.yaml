  class: LFGBotManager
  method: GetDungeonLevelRange
  signature: bool LFGBotManager::GetDungeonLevelRange(uint32 dungeonId, uint8 & minLevel,
    uint8 & maxLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum and maximum level requirements for a specified dungeon
    ID.
  description: The GetDungeonLevelRange method fetches the valid level range for a
    given dungeon identifier. It populates the provided minLevel and maxLevel reference
    parameters with the appropriate values if the dungeon exists and has defined level
    restrictions. This functionality is essential for LFG (Looking For Group) systems
    to ensure players are within acceptable level ranges before joining dungeons.
    The method returns true upon successful retrieval of level data, or false if the
    dungeon ID is invalid or does not have level constraints defined.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon whose level range is to be retrieved.
      This corresponds to the ID used in the game's dungeon database entries.
  - name: minLevel
    description: Reference to a uint8 variable that will be set to the minimum allowed
      player level for the specified dungeon.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: Reference to a uint8 variable that will be set to the maximum allowed
      player level for the specified dungeon.
  returns: Returns true if the dungeon ID was found and valid level range data exists;
    otherwise returns false if the dungeon does not exist or has no defined level
    constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint8 minLevel = 0;\nuint8 maxLevel = 0;\nif (LFGBotManager::GetDungeonLevelRange(1234,\
      \ minLevel, maxLevel)) {\n    std::cout << \"Dungeon level range: \" << static_cast<int>(minLevel)\
      \ << \" - \" << static_cast<int>(maxLevel) << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Invalid dungeon ID or no level constraints found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Validation
    code: "uint8 playerLevel = 60;\nuint8 minLevel = 0;\nuint8 maxLevel = 0;\nif (LFGBotManager::GetDungeonLevelRange(5678,\
      \ minLevel, maxLevel) && \n    playerLevel >= minLevel && playerLevel <= maxLevel)\
      \ {\n    // Player can join the dungeon\n    std::cout << \"Player is eligible\
      \ to enter the dungeon.\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Player cannot join\
      \ the dungeon\n    std::cout << \"Player level does not meet dungeon requirements.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal dungeon data structures and assumes that dungeon
    IDs are valid and correspond to existing entries in the game's database. It is
    typically used during LFG matchmaking processes to filter out players who do not
    meet level requirements for specific dungeons.
  warnings: Ensure that the dungeonId passed to this function is valid to avoid undefined
    behavior. The method modifies the minLevel and maxLevel references directly, so
    these should be initialized or handled carefully to prevent unexpected values.
