  brief: Updates and manages buffs for the AI-controlled unit
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for maintaining and applying
    buffs to an AI-controlled unit within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    handles buff expiration checks, reapplication of beneficial effects, and ensures
    that the unit maintains optimal status based on its AI behavior and combat state.
    It integrates with the core AI system to manage the lifecycle of temporary enhancements
    such as stat boosts, healing effects, or other beneficial auras that are crucial
    for NPC performance in World of Warcraft gameplay.

    code: "void MyAI::Update()\n{\n    UpdateBuffs();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The implementation
    may vary between different AI types (e.g., melee, ranged, caster) and could involve
    complex logic for buff stacking, priority management, and cooldown handling.
