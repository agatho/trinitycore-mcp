documentation:
  brief: Despawns all summons in the SummonList.
  description: The DespawnAll method removes all summoned creatures or game objects
    that are currently managed by this SummonList. It iterates through the list of
    summons and triggers their despawn process, effectively removing them from the
    world. This method is commonly used during creature destruction, combat end, or
    when resetting summon states. The operation affects all summons regardless of
    their type or status within the list.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustDied()\
      \ override\n    {\n        summons.DespawnAll();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Event Handling
    code: "void OnEventTriggered(uint32 eventId)\n{\n    if (eventId == EVENT_RESET_SUMMONS)\n\
      \    {\n        summons.DespawnAll();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly delete the summon objects from memory; instead,
    it calls their individual despawn logic. It is important to ensure that any summoned
    creatures or game objects are properly handled before calling this method to avoid
    dangling references.
  warnings: Calling DespawnAll on a SummonList that contains summons with active AI
    behaviors may cause unexpected behavior if those summons rely on their existence
    for proper operation. Always verify the state of summons before invoking this
    method.
