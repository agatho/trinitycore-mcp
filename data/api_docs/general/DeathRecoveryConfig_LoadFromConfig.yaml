  class: DeathRecoveryConfig
  method: LoadFromConfig
  signature: DeathRecoveryConfig DeathRecoveryConfig::LoadFromConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns a DeathRecoveryConfig object by loading settings
    from the server configuration files.
  description: The LoadFromConfig method is responsible for reading and applying death
    recovery related settings from the TrinityCore configuration system. This includes
    parameters such as resurrection delay, experience loss percentages, and other
    gameplay mechanics tied to character death and revival. The method ensures that
    all relevant configuration values are properly parsed and stored within the DeathRecoveryConfig
    instance. It typically gets invoked during server startup or when configuration
    changes are detected, ensuring that the game's death recovery behavior adheres
    to the current settings defined in the config files.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a fully initialized DeathRecoveryConfig object populated with values
    read from the configuration system. The returned object contains all death recovery
    related settings and can be used to determine how death and resurrection mechanics
    should behave in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DeathRecoveryConfig config = DeathRecoveryConfig::LoadFromConfig();

      // config now holds all death recovery settings from config files'
    language: cpp
  - title: Server Startup Integration
    code: "void OnServerInit() {\n    // Load death recovery configuration at server\
      \ startup\n    sDeathRecoveryConfig = DeathRecoveryConfig::LoadFromConfig();\n\
      \    // Use config values for gameplay logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs configuration parsing and validation. It should only
    be called once during server initialization or when reloading configuration settings.
    The method may block briefly while reading from configuration files, though this
    is typically negligible in practice.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    memory leaks or inconsistent state. Ensure that configuration values are properly
    validated before use, as malformed config entries could cause unexpected behavior.
