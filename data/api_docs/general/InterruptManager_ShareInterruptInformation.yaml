  class: InterruptManager
  method: ShareInterruptInformation
  signature: void InterruptManager::ShareInterruptInformation(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Shares interrupt information with group members
  description: The ShareInterruptInformation method broadcasts interrupt-related data
    to all members of a player's group. This functionality is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to synchronize interrupt states, such as spell
    interruptions or ability cancellations, across players in the same group. The
    method ensures that all group members are aware of interrupt events that may affect
    their gameplay, maintaining consistency in multiplayer scenarios. It operates
    within the InterruptManager class which handles various interrupt-related game
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of group members
      to share interrupt information with. This parameter likely determines how many
      players in the group will receive the interrupt data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for sharing interrupt information
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      int groupSize = 5;

      interruptMgr.ShareInterruptInformation(groupSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger interrupt handling system in TrinityCore.
    It may involve network communication to broadcast interrupt data to group members,
    and should be called when interrupt events occur that need synchronization across
    the group.
