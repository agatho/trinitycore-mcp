documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell IDs associated with a specified item set ID from the
    database.
  description: The GetItemSetSpells method fetches an array of spell identifiers that
    are linked to a particular item set within the TrinityCore database. This functionality
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft to determine which spells are activated
    when a player equips a full set of items belonging to the same set. The returned
    pointer points to an internal static array, so it should not be modified or freed
    by the caller. The method assumes that the item set data has been properly loaded
    into memory via DB2 files such as ItemSet.db2.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array containing spell IDs associated
    with the given item set ID. Returns NULL if no spells are found for the specified
    item set or if the item set does not exist in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through spells of an item set
    code: "const int* spellIds = sDB2Manager->GetItemSetSpells(1234);\nif (spellIds\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10 && spellIds[i] != 0; ++i)\n   \
      \ {\n        printf(\"Spell ID: %d\\n\", spellIds[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a pointer to an internal static array, which means the
    data is shared across all calls and must not be modified. It's important to note
    that the returned array may contain up to 10 spell IDs, but only the first few
    entries are guaranteed to be valid; subsequent values might be zero or undefined.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the returned pointer as it points to
    internal static memory. Also, ensure that the itemSetId parameter corresponds
    to a valid item set present in ItemSet.db2, otherwise the method will return NULL
    without any error indication.
