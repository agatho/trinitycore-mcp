  class: CharacterCache
  method: UpdateCharacterAccountId
  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterAccountId(const int & guid, uint32
    accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the account ID associated with a character GUID in the cache.
  description: The UpdateCharacterAccountId method updates the internal mapping of
    a character's globally unique identifier (GUID) to its corresponding account ID
    within the CharacterCache. This method is typically used when a character is transferred
    between accounts or when account information needs to be synchronized. The cache
    ensures that subsequent lookups for the character GUID will return the updated
    account ID. This operation modifies the in-memory cache only and does not directly
    interact with the database.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The globally unique identifier of the character whose account ID
      is to be updated. This value should represent a valid character GUID within
      the game world.
  - name: accountId
    description: The new account ID that should be associated with the specified character
      GUID. This represents the unique identifier of the player's account.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Account ID for a Character
    code: 'CharacterCache* cache = sCharacterCache;

      uint32 newAccountId = 12345;

      int characterGuid = 67890;

      cache->UpdateCharacterAccountId(characterGuid, newAccountId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on an in-memory cache and does not persist changes to
    the database. It is important to ensure that any database updates are handled
    separately if persistence is required. The method assumes that the provided GUID
    is valid and exists in the cache.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid character GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or inconsistencies in the cache. Ensure that the character GUID corresponds
    to an existing character before calling this method.
