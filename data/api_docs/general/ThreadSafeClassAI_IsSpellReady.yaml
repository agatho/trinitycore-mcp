  brief: Checks if a specified spell is ready to be cast by the AI-controlled unit
  description: The IsSpellReady method determines whether a given spell is currently
    available for casting by the AI-controlled unit. This check typically evaluates
    factors such as spell cooldowns, mana requirements, and other game mechanics that
    affect spell availability. The method returns true if the spell can be cast immediately,
    and false otherwise. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method is
    crucial for decision-making logic in NPC behavior, ensuring spells are only cast
    when conditions are met. This method is thread-safe and should be used within
    AI update loops or conditional checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is ready to be cast, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the spell is on cooldown, requires
    mana that isn't available, or other conditions prevent casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Readiness Check
    code: "if (ai->IsSpellReady(12345))\n{\n    ai->CastSpell(target, 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI Decision Logic
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n \
      \       return;\n\n    if (IsSpellReady(SPELL_FIREBALL))\n    {\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n\
      \    }\n    else if (IsSpellReady(SPELL_FROST_NOVA))\n    {\n        DoCastAOE(SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be used in contexts
    where thread safety cannot be guaranteed. The implementation likely checks internal
    spell cooldown timers, mana levels, and other state variables to determine readiness.
    Performance-wise, this check is lightweight but should still be used judiciously
    in frequently called AI update loops.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell being ready means it will successfully cast
    - additional validation may be required for complex spell mechanics. This method
    only checks immediate availability and does not account for targeting or line-of-sight
    requirements.
