  class: PlayerTaxi
  method: SaveTaxiDestinationsToString
  signature: std::string PlayerTaxi::SaveTaxiDestinationsToString()
documentation:
  brief: Serializes the player's taxi destination nodes into a string format for storage
    or transmission.
  description: The SaveTaxiDestinationsToString method converts the current set of
    taxi destination nodes stored in the PlayerTaxi object into a serialized string
    representation. This string can be used for saving the player's taxi route data
    to a database, sending over the network, or persisting state between sessions.
    The method typically encodes the taxi node IDs and their order in a format suitable
    for later reconstruction using the corresponding LoadTaxiDestinationsFromString
    method. The serialization process ensures that the player's known taxi destinations
    are preserved across game sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the serialized representation of all taxi destination
    nodes. The string format is typically a space-separated list of node IDs or a
    more complex encoded structure depending on the internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PlayerTaxi* taxi = player->GetTaxi();

      std::string serializedDestinations = taxi->SaveTaxiDestinationsToString();

      // The serialized string can now be saved to database or sent over network

      printf("Serialized destinations: %s\n", serializedDestinations.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with SaveTaxiDestinationsFromString
    for persisting taxi route data. The exact serialization format may vary based
    on the TrinityCore version and internal implementation details. It's recommended
    to use this method only when necessary as string serialization can be computationally
    expensive for large numbers of destinations.
