documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the group coordination system is currently active and operational.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the group coordination system within
    TrinityCore is currently enabled and functioning. This system manages various
    group-related functionalities such as loot distribution, role assignments, and
    synchronization of group activities. The method returns true when the coordination
    system is fully initialized and ready to handle group operations, and false otherwise.
    This check is typically used before performing group coordination tasks to ensure
    system readiness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group coordination system is active and operational;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (groupCoordination->IsActive()) {\n    // Proceed with group coordination\
      \ operations\n    groupCoordination->AssignLootMaster();\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ inactive coordination system\n    sLog->outError(\"Group coordination is not\
      \ active\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and has minimal performance overhead.
    It should be called frequently in systems that rely on group coordination to ensure
    proper operation.
