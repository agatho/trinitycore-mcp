  signature: void AccountMgr::ClearRBAC()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions and assignments for
    an account.
  description: The ClearRBAC method removes all Role-Based Access Control permissions,
    roles, and grants associated with a specific account in the TrinityCore authentication
    system. This function is typically used when resetting or reconfiguring administrative
    privileges for a user account. The operation affects the account's ability to
    access game features, realms, or administrative functions based on RBAC rules.
    It does not remove the account itself from the database but rather resets its
    permission state to default. This method is usually invoked during account management
    operations or when transitioning an account between different privilege levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear RBAC for a specific account
    code: AccountMgr::ClearRBAC();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the current account context and should be used carefully
    as it permanently removes all RBAC assignments. The operation is typically performed
    in the authentication or account management subsystem of TrinityCore.
  warnings: Using this method will immediately revoke all administrative privileges
    for the account. Ensure that proper backups or alternative access methods are
    available before executing this function, especially in production environments.
