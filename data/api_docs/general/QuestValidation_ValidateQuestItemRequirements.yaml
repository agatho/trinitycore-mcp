  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestItemRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestItemRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all item requirements for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateQuestItemRequirements method checks if the specified player
    has all required items for the given quest ID. It evaluates the player's inventory
    against the quest's item requirements, including quantity and specific item IDs.
    This method is typically used during quest acceptance or completion validation
    to ensure players have the necessary items before proceeding. The function returns
    true if all item requirements are met, false otherwise. This validation is crucial
    for maintaining game balance and ensuring proper quest progression.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate item requirements
      for. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose inventory
      is being checked against quest requirements. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if all item requirements for the quest are satisfied by the
    player's inventory, false otherwise. If the quest ID does not exist or has no
    item requirements, the method returns true.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Item Validation
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Valid player pointer\n\
      if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestItemRequirements(questId, player)) {\n   \
      \ // Player has all required items\n    // Proceed with quest acceptance or\
      \ completion\n} else {\n    // Player is missing required items\n    // Send\
      \ appropriate message to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Acceptance Logic
    code: "bool CanAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (!player\
      \ || questId == 0) return false;\n    \n    // Check item requirements first\n\
      \    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateQuestItemRequirements(questId, player)) {\n\
      \        player->SendNotification(\"You do not have all required items for this\
      \ quest.\");\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ quest acceptance logic\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups to retrieve quest item requirements,
    so it may have performance implications when called frequently. The validation
    considers both item quantities and specific item IDs as defined in the quest's
    database entries. It does not modify player inventory or quest state; it only
    validates existing conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. This method assumes the quest ID exists in the
    database, otherwise behavior may be unpredictable. The validation does not account
    for quest-specific item restrictions like soulbound items or unique item limitations
    beyond basic quantity checks.
