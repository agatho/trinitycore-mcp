documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of members currently in the guild
  description: The GetMembers method retrieves the total count of players who are
    currently members of the guild. This count includes all active members, regardless
    of their online status or role within the guild. The method provides a quick way
    to determine the size of the guild for administrative purposes or game logic that
    depends on guild population. It's commonly used in guild-related systems such
    as guild limits, member-based rewards, or UI displays showing guild membership.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the total number of members
    in the guild. The value is always non-negative and reflects the current membership
    count.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Guild* myGuild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);

      int memberCount = myGuild->GetMembers();

      printf("Guild has %d members\n", memberCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Guild Size Limits
    code: "Guild* guild = player->GetGuild();\nif (guild)\n{\n    int currentMembers\
      \ = guild->GetMembers();\n    if (currentMembers >= MAX_GUILD_MEMBERS)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Handle guild at maximum capacity\n        SendGuildFullMessage();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a cached value that is updated when members join or leave
    the guild. The return type is a const reference to prevent modification of internal
    state, which ensures data integrity. Performance is generally fast as it simply
    returns a stored count rather than iterating through member lists.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only returns the current member count and does
    not distinguish between online and offline members. If you need to perform operations
    based on specific member states, additional filtering may be required.
