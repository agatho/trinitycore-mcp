documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LootAnalysis class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LootAnalysis
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application's
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's loot system to access
    global loot analysis functionality. The returned pointer provides access to all
    loot-related analysis methods and data structures. This implementation typically
    uses a static local variable or similar thread-safe mechanism to guarantee single
    instantiation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of LootAnalysis. The method never returns
    NULL in normal operation, as it creates the instance on first access if it doesn't
    already exist.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Loot Analysis Singleton
    code: 'LootAnalysis* lootAnalyzer = LootAnalysis::instance();

      // Use the analyzer to perform loot analysis operations

      lootAnalyzer->ProcessLootData(playerGuid, itemEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern which means that all calls to instance()
    will return the same object reference. The implementation should be thread-safe
    in a multi-threaded environment like TrinityCore. This is typically implemented
    using the Meyers' singleton pattern with a static local variable for C++11 and
    later.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, excessive reliance on global state can make
    code harder to test and maintain. Be cautious when using this in unit tests where
    you might want to mock or replace the singleton behavior.
