  class: VehicleAI
  method: VehicleAI
  signature: void VehicleAI::VehicleAI(Creature * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a VehicleAI instance for a creature with the specified script
    ID.
  description: The VehicleAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a vehicle
    creature in TrinityCore. This method sets up the necessary internal state and
    configuration required for the vehicle to function properly within the game world,
    including handling passenger interactions, movement mechanics, and vehicle-specific
    behaviors. The scriptId parameter allows for different AI behaviors to be associated
    with specific vehicle types or configurations. This constructor is typically called
    internally by the core framework when a vehicle creature is created and should
    not be invoked directly by custom scripts unless implementing a custom vehicle
    AI.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will use this VehicleAI instance.
      Must not be null and must represent a valid vehicle creature.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Integer identifier used to determine which specific AI script or
      behavior pattern should be applied to this vehicle. This ID maps to predefined
      vehicle AI configurations in the core.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic VehicleAI Initialization
    code: "class MyVehicleAI : public VehicleAI {\npublic:\n    MyVehicleAI(Creature*\
      \ creature, int scriptId) : VehicleAI(creature, scriptId) {}\n};\n\n// Usage\
      \ in a custom vehicle creation context\nCreature* vehicle = ...; // Valid vehicle\
      \ creature\nint vehicleScriptId = 12345;\nMyVehicleAI* ai = new MyVehicleAI(vehicle,\
      \ vehicleScriptId);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal AI framework and should not be called
    directly by custom scripts. VehicleAI instances are typically created automatically
    when a vehicle creature is spawned. The scriptId parameter is used to determine
    which vehicle AI behavior to apply, and valid IDs are defined in the core's vehicle
    AI configuration system.
  warnings: Attempting to create a VehicleAI instance with a null creature pointer
    will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the creature passed
    is actually a valid vehicle type before calling this constructor.
