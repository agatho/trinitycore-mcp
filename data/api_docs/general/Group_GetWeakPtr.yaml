  signature: int Group::GetWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer identifier for the group object
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves a unique integer identifier that represents
    the group's weak pointer reference. This identifier is typically used internally
    by TrinityCore's object management system to track group references without creating
    strong ownership dependencies. The returned value serves as a handle for identifying
    and accessing the group instance in various subsystems such as player tracking,
    event handling, or network synchronization. This method does not perform any operations
    that would alter the group's state and is safe to call from any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the weak pointer identifier for this group
    object. This identifier is unique within the scope of active groups and can be
    used to reference the group instance in internal systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve group weak pointer
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int weakPtr = group->GetWeakPtr();\n\
      \    // Use weakPtr for internal tracking or logging\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Group weak pointer: %d\", weakPtr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal TrinityCore use and should
    not typically be called by custom modules unless implementing low-level object
    management features. The returned value may change between different versions
    of the core and should not be relied upon for persistent storage or external communication.
