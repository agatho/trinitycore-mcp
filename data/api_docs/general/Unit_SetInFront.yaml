  class: Unit
  method: SetInFront
  signature: void Unit::SetInFront(const int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit's facing direction towards a target position.
  description: The SetInFront method adjusts the unit's orientation to face a specific
    target position in the world. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to
    ensure that units (such as NPCs or players) properly orient themselves towards
    a given point, which is essential for proper interaction with the environment
    and other entities. It typically involves calculating the angle between the unit's
    current position and the target position, then setting the unit's facing direction
    accordingly. This method is often used in conjunction with movement and positioning
    logic to ensure accurate orientation during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target coordinates (x,
      y, z). The array should contain at least three elements representing X, Y, and
      Z coordinates respectively. This parameter is required for calculating the facing
      direction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int targetCoords[3] = {100, 200, 0};

      Unit->SetInFront(targetCoords);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically requires the unit to be in a valid state for orientation
    calculations. It may involve internal calculations of angles and direction, which
    could impact performance if used frequently in loops or during high-frequency
    updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect orientation, potentially
    causing issues with NPC interaction, movement, or combat behavior. Ensure that
    the target coordinates are valid and represent a real position in the game world.
