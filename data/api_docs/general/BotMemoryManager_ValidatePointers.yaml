  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: ValidatePointers
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::ValidatePointers()
documentation:
  brief: Validates all memory pointers managed by the bot memory manager to ensure
    they are still valid and accessible.
  description: The ValidatePointers method performs a comprehensive check on all memory
    pointers currently tracked by the BotMemoryManager instance. This method ensures
    that referenced memory locations are still valid and have not been deallocated
    or corrupted. It is typically invoked during critical game states or before accessing
    managed memory to prevent undefined behavior or crashes. The validation process
    may include checking for null pointers, verifying memory alignment, and confirming
    that allocated memory regions are still accessible. This method plays a crucial
    role in maintaining the stability of AI-controlled bot entities within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Basic Pointer Validation
    code: 'BotMemoryManager memoryManager;

      // ... allocate and manage some pointers ...

      memoryManager.ValidatePointers(); // Validate all managed pointers'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically during bot operation to maintain
    memory integrity. It may have performance implications if invoked too frequently,
    as it performs checks on all tracked memory locations.
  warnings: Invoking this method during critical game ticks or high-frequency operations
    might introduce noticeable lag. Ensure that pointer validation does not interfere
    with real-time bot decision-making processes.
