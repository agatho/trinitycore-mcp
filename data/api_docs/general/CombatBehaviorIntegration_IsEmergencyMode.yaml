  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: IsEmergencyMode
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::IsEmergencyMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat behavior integration is currently operating
    in emergency mode.
  description: The IsEmergencyMode method checks if the CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance is currently in emergency mode. This mode typically indicates that the
    AI has detected a critical situation or threat level that requires immediate response
    actions. The method returns a boolean value to signify the current state of the
    integration's emergency protocol. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment,
    this could be triggered by low health conditions, high aggro levels, or other
    combat-related events that necessitate urgent tactical responses.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the CombatBehaviorIntegration is currently in emergency
    mode, indicating an urgent combat state. Returns false if the integration is operating
    normally without emergency conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (combatBehavior->IsEmergencyMode()) {\n    // Handle emergency combat\
      \ behavior\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EMERGENCY_RETREAT, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Emergency Response
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (combatBehavior->IsEmergencyMode())\
      \ {\n        // Execute emergency tactics\n        DoEmergencyCombat();\n  \
      \  } else {\n        // Normal combat behavior\n        DoNormalCombat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat state checks
    to determine appropriate AI behavior. The emergency mode might be set by internal
    logic based on health thresholds, threat levels, or specific combat events. This
    check should be performed frequently during combat updates to ensure timely response
    to changing conditions.
  warnings: The method does not modify any internal state; it only reads the current
    emergency mode flag. Developers should ensure that emergency mode is properly
    set by other methods in the class before relying on this check. Incorrect assumptions
    about emergency state can lead to inappropriate combat behavior or missed tactical
    opportunities.
