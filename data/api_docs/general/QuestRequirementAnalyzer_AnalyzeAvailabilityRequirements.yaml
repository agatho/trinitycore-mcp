  class: QuestRequirementAnalyzer
  method: AnalyzeAvailabilityRequirements
  signature: void QuestRequirementAnalyzer::AnalyzeAvailabilityRequirements(const
    Quest * quest, Player * bot, int & issues)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes quest availability requirements for a player and updates the issue
    count.
  description: The AnalyzeAvailabilityRequirements method evaluates whether a given
    quest is available to a specific player based on various game conditions such
    as level requirements, quest completion status, faction restrictions, and other
    prerequisite checks. It modifies the provided issues parameter to reflect any
    availability problems encountered during the analysis. This method is typically
    used in automated quest checking systems or quest log analyzers within TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs to be analyzed for availability
      requirements. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose quest
      availability is being checked. Must not be null.
  - name: issues
    description: Reference to an integer that will be incremented based on any availability
      issues found during analysis. The value is modified in-place.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Availability Check
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* player = ...;\
      \ // Get player reference\nint issueCount = 0;\nquestAnalyzer.AnalyzeAvailabilityRequirements(quest,\
      \ player, issueCount);\nif (issueCount > 0) {\n    // Handle availability issues\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple checks including level, faction, quest completion,
    and item requirements. It's designed to be efficient for batch processing of quests
    in automated systems but may involve database lookups depending on the complexity
    of the quest requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that both quest and bot parameters are valid non-null pointers
    before calling this method. Failure to do so can result in undefined behavior
    or crashes.
