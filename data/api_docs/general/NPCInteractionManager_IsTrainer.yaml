  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsTrainer(Creature * npc) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Creature is a trainer NPC.
  description: The IsTrainer method checks if the provided Creature object represents
    a non-player character that serves as a trainer for players. This method evaluates
    the creature's flags, npcflags, and other relevant attributes to determine if
    it can offer training services such as skill or spell learning. It is commonly
    used in interaction logic to enable or disable trainer-specific UI elements and
    actions when a player interacts with an NPC.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Creature is a trainer NPC, false otherwise. A trainer
    NPC typically has specific flags set in its database entry that indicate it can
    teach skills, spells, or abilities to players.
  examples:
  - title: Check if NPC is a Trainer
    code: "if (NPCInteractionManager::IsTrainer(creature)) {\n    // Show trainer\
      \ UI\n    player->SendTrainerList(creature);\n} else {\n    // Handle non-trainer\
      \ interaction\n    player->SendGossipMenuFor(creature);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags and database entries to determine trainer
    status. It does not perform runtime checks on the creature's current state or
    availability, but rather evaluates static properties defined at spawn time.
