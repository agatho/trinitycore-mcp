  class: ProfessionManager
  method: GetAutomationProfile
  signature: ProfessionAutomationProfile ProfessionManager::GetAutomationProfile(uint32
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the automation profile associated with a specified player's GUID.
  description: The GetAutomationProfile method fetches the profession automation settings
    for a given player identified by their unique identifier (GUID). This profile
    contains configuration data that determines how automated actions are performed
    in the game for that specific player, such as which professions to automate and
    at what level. The method is typically used within the context of managing player
    character behavior and automation rules. It assumes that the player exists in
    the system and has a valid automation profile configured.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ProfessionAutomationProfile object containing all relevant automation
    settings for the specified player. If no automation profile exists for the given
    player GUID, an empty or default-initialized profile may be returned depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Automation Profile for Player
    code: 'uint32 playerId = 12345;

      ProfessionAutomationProfile profile = sProfessionManager->GetAutomationProfile(playerId);

      // Use profile data to determine automation behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves database lookups or cached data retrieval. Ensure
    that the player GUID is valid before calling this method to avoid unexpected results.
    The returned profile object should not be modified directly unless explicitly
    intended by the API design.
