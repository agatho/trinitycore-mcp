  brief: Teleports the player to a nearby location using the Stuck spell effect.
  description: The EffectStuck method implements the functionality of the 'Stuck'
    spell in World of Warcraft, which allows players to teleport themselves to a nearby
    location. This method is typically used when players are stuck or unable to move,
    and it provides a way to escape from certain situations by teleporting them to
    a nearby location. The implementation involves finding a suitable nearby location
    and teleporting the player there, usually with a small delay or cooldown period.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectStuck();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during spell execution and may involve checking
    for valid targets or locations before teleporting. Implementation details include
    handling of cooldowns, target selection, and possibly a delay in the teleportation
    process.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context; it's part
    of a larger spell system and requires proper spell handling to function correctly.
    Improper use may result in unexpected behavior or game mechanics issues.
