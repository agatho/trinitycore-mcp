documentation:
  brief: Reloads the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions and configuration
    from the database
  description: The ReloadRBAC method refreshes all Role-Based Access Control settings
    in the World server, including user roles, permissions, and access levels. This
    function is typically invoked when administrative changes have been made to the
    RBAC system through the database or in-game commands, ensuring that the running
    server instance reflects the latest permission configurations. The method reloads
    data from the auth database tables such as rbac_permissions, rbac_roles, and related
    linking tables. It does not require any parameters and performs a complete refresh
    of the RBAC system state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Admin Command
    code: "void HandleReloadRBACCommand(ChatHandler* handler)\n{\n    sWorld->ReloadRBAC();\n\
      \    handler->SendSysMessage(\"RBAC permissions reloaded successfully.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by administrative commands or during server
    startup when RBAC data needs to be refreshed. It performs a full reload of the
    RBAC system, which may cause temporary performance impact if executed during high-traffic
    periods. The operation is thread-safe and does not affect ongoing player sessions.
  warnings: Executing this method while players are actively logged in may temporarily
    disrupt access control for those users until the reload completes. It should be
    used cautiously during peak server hours.
