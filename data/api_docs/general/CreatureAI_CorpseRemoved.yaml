  signature: void CreatureAI::CorpseRemoved(int & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature's corpse is removed from the world, allowing AI to
    perform cleanup or state changes.
  description: The CorpseRemoved method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when
    a creature's corpse has been removed from the game world. This typically occurs
    after the corpse despawns due to time expiration or player looting. The method
    provides an opportunity for custom CreatureAI implementations to execute cleanup
    logic, reset AI states, or trigger other related behaviors. It is part of the
    creature AI lifecycle and is called during the destruction phase of a creature's
    death cycle. This method does not take any parameters and should be used primarily
    for cleanup operations rather than state modification.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void CorpseRemoved(int&\
      \ param0) override\n    {\n        // Reset AI state when corpse is removed\n\
      \        me->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n        //\
      \ Perform any cleanup operations here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the creature's destruction phase and should
    not be used to modify creature properties that might cause further state changes.
    The parameter 'param0' appears to be unused or reserved but is included in the
    signature for compatibility reasons.
  warnings: Do not attempt to access or modify the creature object's properties after
    calling this method, as the creature may already be partially destroyed or removed
    from the world. Avoid performing heavy operations in this method to prevent performance
    degradation during cleanup.
