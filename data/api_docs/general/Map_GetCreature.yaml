  method: GetCreature
  signature: Creature * Map::GetCreature(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a specific creature object from the map using its unique identifier
    (GUID).
  description: The GetCreature method allows developers to fetch a Creature object
    from the Map class by its GUID. This is particularly useful for accessing creatures
    that are already present in the world, such as those spawned during instance encounters
    or quest-related NPCs. The method returns a pointer to the Creature object if
    found, or nullptr if no creature with the specified GUID exists in the map. It's
    commonly used in scripting and game logic where precise creature identification
    is required.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the creature to retrieve. This is
      typically a 32-bit integer value representing the creature's ID within the game
      world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Creature object if found, or nullptr if no creature
    with the specified GUID exists in the map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = map->GetCreature(12345);\nif (creature)\n{\n    //\
      \ Creature found, perform actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with error handling
    code: "Creature* creature = map->GetCreature(12345);\nif (creature != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with creature operations\n    creature->SetDisplayId(1234);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle missing creature case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe when used properly, but requires careful handling
    in multi-threaded environments. Performance can be affected if many creatures
    are stored in the map and the GUID lookup needs to traverse all objects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with large numbers of creatures; it
    may cause performance degradation if not used efficiently. Also, ensure that the
    GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing creature in the map.
