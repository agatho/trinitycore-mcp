  class: BotCharacterCreator

  signature: std::string BotCharacterCreator::GenerateDefaultBotName(uint8 race, uint8
    gender)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a default bot character name based on the specified race and gender.
  description: The GenerateDefaultBotName method creates a standardized bot character
    name using predefined naming conventions for different races and genders within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used when creating automated
    or AI-controlled player characters (bots) in World of Warcraft environments. The
    generated names follow established patterns that align with the game's naming
    system, ensuring consistency and compatibility with existing game mechanics. The
    method requires valid race and gender parameters to produce a meaningful name,
    and it does not perform any validation on input values beyond basic type checking.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial type of the bot character (0-10). Valid values correspond
      to standard WoW race IDs such as Human (1), Orc (2), Dwarf (3), Night Elf (4),
      Undead (5), Tauren (6), Gnome (7), Troll (8), Goblin (9), Blood Elf (10), and
      others.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the bot character (0-1). Value 0 represents male, and
      value 1 represents female. Any other values may produce unexpected results or
      default names.
  returns: A std::string containing the generated default bot name formatted according
    to race and gender specifications. The returned string follows standard naming
    conventions for WoW bots and is suitable for direct use in character creation
    processes.
  examples:
  - title: Generate a male Human bot name
    code: 'BotCharacterCreator creator;

      std::string name = creator.GenerateDefaultBotName(1, 0); // Human male

      // Result might be something like "BotHumanMale12345"'
    language: cpp
  - title: Generate a female Undead bot name
    code: 'BotCharacterCreator creator;

      std::string name = creator.GenerateDefaultBotName(5, 1); // Undead female

      // Result might be something like "BotUndeadFemale67890"'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot character creation system and assumes that
    race and gender values are valid within the context of TrinityCore's character
    creation framework. The naming convention may vary based on internal configuration
    settings or custom implementations. The generated names are intended for automated
    use and should not be used directly in user-facing interfaces without additional
    processing.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters beyond their type, so invalid
    race or gender values may produce unexpected or meaningless names. When using
    this method in production environments, ensure that the inputs are properly sanitized
    and validated before calling to prevent potential issues with character creation
    or game consistency.
