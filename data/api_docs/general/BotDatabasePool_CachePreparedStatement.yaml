  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: CachePreparedStatement
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::CachePreparedStatement(uint32 stmtId, const std::string
    & sql)
documentation:
  brief: Caches a prepared SQL statement for use by the bot database pool.
  description: The CachePreparedStatement method stores a SQL statement in the BotDatabasePool's
    internal cache, associating it with a unique identifier. This allows for efficient
    reuse of frequently executed queries without the overhead of re-parsing and compiling
    the SQL each time. The cached statements are typically used by bot systems to
    perform database operations such as retrieving player data, updating bot configurations,
    or managing bot-related information. The method is designed to improve performance
    by reducing redundant SQL compilation efforts within the context of the bot subsystem.
  parameters:
  - name: stmtId
    description: A unique identifier for the prepared statement. This ID is used to
      reference the cached statement in subsequent database operations. Must be a
      positive integer that uniquely identifies this specific SQL query within the
      pool.
  - name: sql
    description: The SQL statement string to be prepared and cached. This should be
      a valid SQL query that can be executed against the bot database. The statement
      will be parsed, compiled, and stored for future use by the database pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 stmtId = 1001;

      std::string sql = "SELECT * FROM bot_players WHERE guid = ?";

      BotDatabasePool::instance()->CachePreparedStatement(stmtId, sql);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Multiple Statements
    code: 'BotDatabasePool::instance()->CachePreparedStatement(1001, "SELECT * FROM
      bot_players WHERE guid = ?");

      BotDatabasePool::instance()->CachePreparedStatement(1002, "UPDATE bot_players
      SET last_seen = ? WHERE guid = ?");

      BotDatabasePool::instance()->CachePreparedStatement(1003, "INSERT INTO bot_logs
      (bot_id, action, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or setup phases of
    the bot system. The cached statements are thread-safe and can be accessed concurrently
    by multiple threads. It's recommended to cache only frequently used statements
    to avoid memory overhead. The statement ID must be unique within the pool to prevent
    conflicts.
  warnings: Calling this method with an already cached statement ID will overwrite
    the previous statement, potentially causing unexpected behavior if other parts
    of the code depend on the old statement. Ensure that all statement IDs are properly
    managed and unique to avoid conflicts.
