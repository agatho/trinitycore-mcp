  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the LFG group coordinator, cleaning up all associated data and
    stopping internal operations.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the LFG
    (Looking For Group) group coordinator's functionality. It ensures that all active
    group queues, pending invitations, and internal state information are properly
    cleaned up before the coordinator is disabled. This method is typically invoked
    during server shutdown or when the LFG system needs to be temporarily suspended.
    The operation is synchronous and will block until all cleanup processes are complete.
    No new LFG operations should be initiated after this method is called.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator* coordinator = sLFGMgr->GetGroupCoordinator();

      coordinator->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the LFG system is no longer needed
    or during server shutdown. It's not thread-safe and must be called from a context
    where no other LFG operations are in progress.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while active LFG operations are ongoing may result in
    data loss or inconsistent state. Ensure all pending group operations have completed
    before invoking this method.
