  class: Arena
  method: UpdateArenaWorldState
  signature: void Arena::UpdateArenaWorldState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the world state information for all active arena battles in the game.
  description: The UpdateArenaWorldState method is responsible for synchronizing and
    refreshing the visual and functional state of arena battles across the game world.
    This includes updating player scores, match timers, team statistics, and other
    relevant arena-specific data that is displayed to players in real-time. The method
    ensures that all clients have consistent and up-to-date information about ongoing
    arena matches, which is crucial for maintaining fair gameplay and accurate scoring
    during competitive battles. It typically gets invoked periodically or upon specific
    events such as score changes or match status updates.

  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Update Loop
    code: "void Arena::UpdateArenaWorldState()\n{\n    for (auto& arena : sArenaTeamMgr->GetAllArenas())\n\
      \    {\n        if (arena->IsInProgress())\n            arena->SendArenaWorldState();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during arena match updates to ensure
    client synchronization. It may involve sending packets to multiple players simultaneously,
    so performance optimization is important for large server environments.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper arena update contexts might cause
    inconsistent state or client-side display issues. Ensure that all arena matches
    are in valid states before invoking this function.
