documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current encounter is running in heroic difficulty.
  description: The IsHeroic method checks if the current instance or encounter is
    operating in heroic difficulty mode. This is commonly used in scripted AI behavior
    to adjust mob abilities, health, damage, or other mechanics based on the difficulty
    level. The method typically relies on the instance's difficulty settings and returns
    true when heroic mode is active, false otherwise. This check is essential for
    creating dynamic and appropriate combat experiences that scale with player challenge
    level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current encounter or instance is in heroic difficulty
    mode; otherwise returns false.

    code: "class MyBossAI : public ScriptedAI\n{\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ who) override\n    {\n        if (IsHeroic())\n        {\n            // Apply\
      \ heroic-specific abilities\n            DoCast(me, SPELL_HEROIC_ENRAGE);\n\
      \        }\n        else\n        {\n            // Apply normal difficulty\
      \ abilities\n            DoCast(me, SPELL_NORMAL_ENRAGE);\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"

  notes: This method typically accesses the instance's difficulty settings through
    the associated GameObject or Creature's instance data. It is recommended to cache
    this value if checking it frequently during combat, as repeated calls may have
    minor performance implications in high-frequency scenarios.
