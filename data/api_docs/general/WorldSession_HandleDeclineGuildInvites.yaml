    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to decline all pending guild invites.
  description: This method processes a packet sent by the client indicating that the
    player wishes to decline all pending guild invitations. It iterates through the
    player's active guild invitations and removes them from the system, ensuring no
    further notifications or prompts are shown for those specific invites. The operation
    is typically triggered when a player clicks a 'Decline All' button in the guild
    invitation interface. This method does not directly modify any database entries
    but rather manages the in-memory state of pending guild invites associated with
    the session.

  returns: null

    code: "void WorldSession::HandleDeclineGuildInvites(WorldPackets::Guild::DeclineGuildInvites&\

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild invitation system and relies on the player's
    internal invite manager to track pending invitations. It assumes that the player
    has been authenticated and is actively connected to the server.
