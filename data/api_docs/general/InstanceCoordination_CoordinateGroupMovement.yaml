  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: CoordinateGroupMovement
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::CoordinateGroupMovement(Group * group, const
    int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates movement of a group to a specified destination within an instance.
  description: The CoordinateGroupMovement method handles the synchronization and
    execution of group movement to a defined destination within a World of Warcraft
    instance. This method is typically used in dungeon or raid scenarios where multiple
    players need to be moved together to specific locations, such as during encounter
    mechanics or instance transitions. It ensures that all group members are properly
    coordinated and teleported to maintain group integrity and game flow. The method
    likely interacts with the instance's movement system and may handle pathfinding,
    teleportation logic, and group synchronization. Precondition includes having a
    valid Group object and a valid destination identifier within the instance context.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players that need to be
      moved. Must be a valid group with members or null.
  - name: destination
    description: Integer identifier representing the destination coordinate or location
      within the instance. Value should correspond to predefined locations in the
      instance's movement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Movement Coordination
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n    InstanceCoordination::CoordinateGroupMovement(raidGroup,\
      \ 1001);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Group Movement
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->GetInstanceId() == 1234)\n{\n    Group* party = player->GetGroup();\n\
      \    if (party && party->GetLeaderGuid() == player->GetGUID())\n    {\n    \
      \    InstanceCoordination::CoordinateGroupMovement(party, 2005);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal synchronization to ensure all group
    members arrive at the destination simultaneously. It may involve sending movement
    packets, handling teleportation events, and managing instance-specific constraints.
    The destination parameter should be validated against known instance coordinates
    to prevent invalid movements.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer or an invalid destination
    ID may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group is valid
    and members are online before calling. This method might not handle all edge cases
    of group member disconnections gracefully.
