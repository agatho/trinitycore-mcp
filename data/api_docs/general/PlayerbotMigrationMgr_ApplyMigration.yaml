  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ApplyMigration(const std::string & version)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a player bot migration for the specified version
  description: 'The ApplyMigration method attempts to perform a migration of player
    bot configurations or data to a specified version. This method is typically used
    during server updates or when transitioning between different versions of the
    player bot system. It ensures that existing player bot data is properly updated
    or converted to maintain compatibility with the target version. The method may
    involve checking current state, validating version compatibility, and executing
    necessary transformation steps. Precondition: A valid migration version string
    must be provided. Postcondition: If successful, the player bot system will be
    updated to the specified version; otherwise, no changes are made.'
  parameters:
  - name: version
    description: The target version string to which the player bot migration should
      be applied. This typically represents a semantic version number or identifier
      that defines the desired state of the player bot system.
  returns: Returns true if the migration was successfully applied to the specified
    version, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate version incompatibility,
    failed validation, or other migration errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Migration Application
    code: "bool success = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ApplyMigration(\"3.3.5\"\
      );\nif (success)\n{\n    // Migration completed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player bot migration to version 3.3.5 completed.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Migration\
      \ failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to apply player bot migration to version\
      \ 3.3.5.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore player bot system and should only
    be called during appropriate server initialization or update phases. The actual
    implementation details depend on how migrations are defined in the system's configuration
    files and database entries.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid version string may result in undefined
    behavior or failed migration attempts. Ensure that the specified version is valid
    and supported by the current player bot system before invoking this method.
