  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: LogEventActivity
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::LogEventActivity(uint32 eventId, const std::string
    & activity)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a guild event activity with the specified event ID and activity description.
  description: The LogEventActivity method records a specific activity related to
    a guild event. It takes an event identifier and a string describing the activity
    that occurred, storing this information for logging or tracking purposes within
    the GuildEventCoordinator system. This method is typically used to maintain a
    history of guild-related events and their associated activities, which can be
    useful for administrative oversight, reward distribution, or event analytics.
    The method does not return any value and operates synchronously.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier for the guild event being logged. This value
      should correspond to a valid event in the system's event registry.
  - name: activity
    description: A descriptive string detailing the activity that occurred during
      the guild event. This may include player actions, outcomes, or other relevant
      information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.LogEventActivity(1001, "Player ''JohnDoe'' completed the raid challenge.");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Activity String
    code: 'std::string activity = "Guild member ''" + playerName + "'' earned achievement
      ''" + achievementName + "''.";

      coordinator.LogEventActivity(eventId, activity);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal logging systems or databases to
    persist event data. It should be called whenever a significant guild event activity
    occurs to ensure comprehensive tracking. Consider performance implications if
    called frequently in high-volume scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the eventId parameter corresponds to an existing event to
    avoid invalid log entries. The activity string should be sanitized to prevent
    injection attacks or malformed data in logs.
