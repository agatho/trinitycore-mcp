  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the marksmanship hunter's rotation based on current target and combat
    state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the optimal ability rotation for a marksmanship hunter class. This method evaluates
    the current combat situation, target health, available resources, and cooldowns
    to decide which abilities should be used next in the rotation sequence. It typically
    integrates with the AI system to make real-time tactical decisions during combat
    encounters. The method operates on the internal state of the hunter and modifies
    its behavior according to the defined marksmanship rotation logic.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity that the hunter is currently engaging
      in combat. This parameter determines the rotation priority and ability selection
      based on target characteristics such as health percentage, threat level, and
      combat status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with target pointer
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunter;

      Unit* enemyTarget = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      int targetId = enemyTarget ? enemyTarget->GetGUID().GetRawValue() : 0;

      hunter.UpdateRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom AI logic. The rotation decisions
    may vary based on hunter's current talent specialization, gear level, and encounter
    phase.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method to
    prevent undefined behavior. This method modifies internal hunter state and should
    only be called when the hunter is in combat mode.
