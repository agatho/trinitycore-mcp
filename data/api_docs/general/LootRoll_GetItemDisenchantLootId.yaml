  method: GetItemDisenchantLootId
  signature: int LootRoll::GetItemDisenchantLootId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the disenchant loot ID associated with the item being rolled on.
  description: The GetItemDisenchantLootId method returns the unique identifier for
    the disenchant loot template that is linked to the item currently involved in
    a loot roll. This ID corresponds to an entry in the `disenchant_loot_template`
    database table, which defines what items or currency are dropped when an item
    is disenchanted. The method is typically used during the loot rolling process
    to determine the appropriate disenchant rewards for a specific item. It does not
    perform any validation or lookup itself; it simply returns the stored ID value
    from the LootRoll object's internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the ID of the disenchant loot template associated
    with the item, or 0 if no disenchant loot is defined for this item.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Disenchant Loot ID for a Loot Roll
    code: "LootRoll* roll = ...; // Assume initialized loot roll\nint disenchantId\
      \ = roll->GetItemDisenchantLootId();\nif (disenchantId > 0)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ disenchant loot using the returned ID\n    sLog->outString(\"Disenchant loot\
      \ ID: %d\", disenchantId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"No disenchant\
      \ loot defined for this item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the LootRoll object has already been properly initialized
    with item data and its associated disenchant template ID. The returned value is
    directly sourced from internal state and should not be modified by external code.
  warnings: Ensure that the LootRoll object is valid and contains a proper item before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized or invalid roll may lead to
    undefined behavior. This method does not validate whether the returned ID actually
    exists in the database.
