  signature: std::vector<AIDecisionCategory> AIDecisionProfiler::GetProblematicCategories(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of AI decision categories that have been flagged as problematic
    for the specified bot.
  description: The GetProblematicCategories method returns a vector of AIDecisionCategory
    enums representing the AI decision-making areas where issues or inefficiencies
    were detected for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This method is typically
    used in debugging and performance optimization scenarios within the TrinityCore
    AI system. The returned categories indicate which aspects of the bot's decision
    logic may require attention, such as pathfinding, target selection, or spell casting
    behavior. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<AIDecisionCategory> containing all problematic AI decision
    categories for the specified bot. Returns an empty vector if no problems are detected
    or if the bot GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::vector<AIDecisionCategory> categories =\
      \ profiler.GetProblematicCategories(botGuid);\nfor (const auto& category : categories)\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Problematic Category: \" << static_cast<int>(category)\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI decision profiler has already collected and
    analyzed data for the specified bot. The profiling data should be updated regularly
    to ensure accurate results. This method is thread-safe when used with properly
    synchronized access to the profiler instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot in the system;
    otherwise, the result may be empty or undefined behavior could occur. This method
    does not validate the existence of the bot before querying its categories.
