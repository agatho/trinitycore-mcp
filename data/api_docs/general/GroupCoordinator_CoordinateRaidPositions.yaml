documentation:
  brief: Coordinates raid member positions for optimal group formation and combat
    readiness.
  description: The CoordinateRaidPositions method manages the spatial arrangement
    of raid members within a group, ensuring proper positioning for coordinated gameplay
    mechanics such as raid encounters, AoE spell targeting, and tactical formations.
    This method typically calculates and assigns optimal positions to players based
    on their roles, class abilities, and current raid composition. It may also handle
    dynamic repositioning during combat situations or when group members are added
    or removed from the raid. The implementation likely involves checking player locations,
    calculating distances, and adjusting positions to maintain proper raid structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Raid Context
    code: "void HandleRaidFormation()\n{\n    GroupCoordinator coordinator;\n    coordinator.CoordinateRaidPositions();\n\
      \    // Positions are now optimized for raid encounter\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on the group's internal data structures and may
    involve complex spatial calculations. It should be called when raid composition
    changes or when repositioning is needed for tactical reasons. The method may have
    performance implications during high-traffic raid scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method in rapid succession without proper cooldowns may cause
    unexpected positioning behavior. Ensure that all group members are properly initialized
    before calling to avoid positioning conflicts.
