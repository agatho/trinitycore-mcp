  class: LootAnalysis
  method: ~LootAnalysis
  signature: void LootAnalysis::~LootAnalysis()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootAnalysis object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The LootAnalysis destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a LootAnalysis instance. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated data structures, clearing internal caches,
    and ensuring that no memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class
    likely manages analysis data related to loot distribution, such as tracking item
    drops, player participation, and statistical information for loot events. The
    destructor ensures proper cleanup of any internal state before the object is fully
    removed from memory.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'LootAnalysis* analysis = new LootAnalysis();

      // ... use the analysis object ...

      delete analysis; // Triggers ~LootAnalysis()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Cleanup with Stack Allocation
    code: "void ProcessLootEvent()\n{\n    LootAnalysis analysis;\n    // ... perform\
      \ loot analysis ...\n    // ~LootAnalysis() automatically called when analysis\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually invoke
    destructors unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destructor
    is typically marked as virtual if this class is intended to be inherited from,
    ensuring proper cleanup of derived classes.
