  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool MLPerformanceTracker::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether machine learning performance tracking is currently enabled
    in the system.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the MLPerformanceTracker instance
    has been activated for monitoring and logging machine learning-related performance
    metrics. This functionality is typically used to control diagnostic data collection
    without requiring a full system restart. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the current operational state of the tracker. When enabled, the tracker may begin
    collecting timing data, resource usage statistics, or other performance indicators
    related to ML operations within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if machine learning performance tracking is currently enabled; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\nif (tracker.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Perform\
      \ ML-related operations with tracking enabled\n    std::cout << \"Tracking is\
      \ active\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Fallback behavior when tracking is\
      \ disabled\n    std::cout << \"Tracking is inactive\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple state check and should have minimal performance
    impact. It's recommended to cache the result if checking frequently in performance-critical
    code paths.
