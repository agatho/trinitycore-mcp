  class: QuestEventBus
  method: Unsubscribe
  signature: void QuestEventBus::Unsubscribe(BotAI * subscriber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a BotAI subscriber from the quest event bus.
  description: The Unsubscribe method removes a specified BotAI subscriber from the
    quest event bus, effectively disconnecting that AI instance from receiving quest-related
    events. This method is typically used when a bot is no longer needed or when it's
    being destroyed to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions.
    The operation is performed synchronously and ensures thread safety by using appropriate
    locking mechanisms internally.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriber
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that should be removed from the quest
      event bus. Must not be null, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: None. This method returns void and performs no value transformations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'BotAI* bot = new BotAI();

      // ... setup bot ...

      QuestEventBus::Instance()->Subscribe(bot);

      // ... perform quest events ...

      QuestEventBus::Instance()->Unsubscribe(bot);

      delete bot;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided BotAI pointer was previously registered
    via Subscribe. It is recommended to call this method before deleting a BotAI instance
    to avoid dangling references and potential memory leaks.
  warnings: Calling Unsubscribe with a null pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the subscriber has been properly subscribed
    before attempting to unsubscribe.
