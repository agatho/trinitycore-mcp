documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AI behavior for a conversation object
  description: The AI_Initialize method sets up the initial state and configuration
    for a conversation's AI system. This method is typically called during the creation
    or activation of a conversation to prepare its artificial intelligence components
    for interaction with players. It establishes default values, registers necessary
    callbacks, and ensures that the conversation is ready to respond to player actions
    or events within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: 'Conversation* conv = new Conversation();

      conv->AI_Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a conversation
    object. Reinitialization may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks if not
    handled properly by the underlying implementation.
  warnings: Do not call AI_Initialize on a conversation that has already been initialized,
    as this could result in resource conflicts or corrupted state. Ensure that all
    required dependencies for the conversation's AI are properly set before invoking
    this method.
