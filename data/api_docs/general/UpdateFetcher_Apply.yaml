  class: UpdateFetcher
  method: Apply
  signature: uint32 UpdateFetcher::Apply(const Path & path) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies updates to the provided path and returns the number of updated elements.
  description: The Apply method processes a given path, applying necessary updates
    or modifications to it. It is typically used in the context of object tracking
    or movement updates within the TrinityCore framework. The method iterates through
    the path and performs update operations on each element, returning the total count
    of successfully updated elements. This method may be part of a larger system responsible
    for maintaining synchronization between client and server states for moving objects
    or dynamic elements in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the number of elements in the path
    that were successfully updated. A return value of zero indicates no updates were
    applied, while a positive value indicates the count of updated elements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Apply method
    code: 'UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      Path myPath;

      // Populate myPath with data

      uint32 updatedCount = fetcher.Apply(myPath);

      // updatedCount now holds the number of elements updated'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with pathfinding or movement systems
    where updates to object positions need to be synchronized. The implementation
    may involve internal state tracking or caching mechanisms that affect performance
    if called frequently.
