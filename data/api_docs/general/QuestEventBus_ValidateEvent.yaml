  signature: bool QuestEventBus::ValidateEvent(const QuestEvent & event) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a quest event is properly configured and meets all required
    criteria for processing.
  description: The ValidateEvent method checks if a given QuestEvent object contains
    valid data and satisfies all necessary conditions to be processed by the quest
    system. This includes verifying that essential fields such as event type, associated
    quest ID, and required parameters are correctly set. The method ensures that malformed
    or incomplete events do not cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the
    quest handling logic. It is typically called internally before an event is dispatched
    to prevent invalid state transitions within the quest subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the QuestEvent is valid and can be safely processed; otherwise
    returns false if any validation checks fail.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "QuestEvent event;\n// Assume event is populated with valid data\nif (questEventBus.ValidateEvent(event))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with event processing\n    questEventBus.ProcessEvent(event);\n\
      } else {\n    // Log invalid event or handle error\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid\
      \ quest event detected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal consistency checks and may involve comparing
    against predefined rules or constraints defined in the quest system's configuration.
    It is recommended to call this method before attempting to process any QuestEvent
    to avoid potential crashes or inconsistent behavior.
