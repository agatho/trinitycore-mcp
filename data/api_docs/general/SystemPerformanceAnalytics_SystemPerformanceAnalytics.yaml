  class: SystemPerformanceAnalytics
  method: SystemPerformanceAnalytics
  signature: void SystemPerformanceAnalytics::SystemPerformanceAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the system performance analytics subsystem for monitoring and
    logging server performance metrics.
  description: The SystemPerformanceAnalytics constructor initializes the performance
    monitoring infrastructure used by TrinityCore to track various server metrics
    such as memory usage, CPU load, packet processing times, and other critical performance
    indicators. This method sets up internal data structures and registers necessary
    callbacks for collecting real-time performance statistics. The initialization
    typically occurs during server startup or when performance monitoring is enabled
    via configuration options. It prepares the system to gather detailed analytics
    that can be used for debugging, optimization, and ensuring optimal gameplay experience.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'SystemPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      // Constructor automatically initializes performance monitoring'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore server
    framework. Developers should not manually instantiate this class unless implementing
    custom performance monitoring features. The initialization process may have minimal
    overhead during server startup but is essential for accurate performance tracking.
