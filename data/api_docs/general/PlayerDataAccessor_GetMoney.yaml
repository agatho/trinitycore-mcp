  method: GetMoney
  signature: uint64 PlayerDataAccessor::GetMoney() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total amount of money (in copper) currently carried by the
    player.
  description: The GetMoney method returns the complete monetary value of the player's
    inventory in copper coins. This value represents all gold, silver, and copper
    pieces combined into a single uint64 value. The returned amount includes money
    stored in the player's inventory, bank, and any other locations where currency
    is held within the game context. This method does not distinguish between different
    types of currency; it aggregates them into one total. The value is typically used
    for display purposes, transaction validation, or when checking if a player has
    sufficient funds for an action.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total amount of money (in copper) owned
    by the player across all locations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Display Player's Money
    code: 'uint64 money = player->GetMoney();

      ChatHandler ch(player->GetSession());

      ch.PSendSysMessage("You have %u copper coins.", money);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if Player Can Afford an Item
    code: "uint64 playerMoney = player->GetMoney();\nuint64 itemCost = 5000; // 50\
      \ silver\nif (playerMoney >= itemCost)\n{\n    // Proceed with purchase\n  \
      \  player->ModifyMoney(-static_cast<int32>(itemCost));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the player's money from their inventory and bank, but
    does not account for temporary currency changes during transactions. The value
    returned is always up-to-date with the current state of the player's money in
    the database.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value directly in monetary calculations without
    considering potential overflow or precision loss if converting to smaller units.
    Also note that this method may return 0 if no money is present, which is a valid
    state.
