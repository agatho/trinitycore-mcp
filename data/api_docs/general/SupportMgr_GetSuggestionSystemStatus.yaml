  signature: bool SupportMgr::GetSuggestionSystemStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks and returns the current status of the suggestion system within the
    SupportMgr.
  description: The GetSuggestionSystemStatus method determines whether the suggestion
    system is currently enabled or disabled within the SupportMgr class. This system
    typically handles user feedback, feature requests, or in-game suggestions submitted
    by players. The method returns a boolean value indicating the operational state
    of this system. It is commonly used to conditionally enable or disable UI elements
    related to suggestions, or to log system status for debugging purposes. The method
    does not require any parameters and performs a simple state check without modifying
    any internal data.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A boolean value indicating the status of the suggestion system: true if
    the system is enabled and operational, false if it is disabled or inactive.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Suggestion System Status
    code: "if (sSupportMgr->GetSuggestionSystemStatus()) {\n    // Enable suggestion-related\
      \ UI elements\n    ShowSuggestionPanel();\n} else {\n    // Hide or disable\
      \ suggestion features\n    HideSuggestionPanel();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Suggestion System Status for Debugging
    code: 'bool isSuggestionEnabled = sSupportMgr->GetSuggestionSystemStatus();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("support", "Suggestion system status: %s", isSuggestionEnabled
      ? "enabled" : "disabled");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any expensive operations.
    It should be safe to call from any thread context, assuming the SupportMgr instance
    itself is thread-safe. The implementation likely relies on an internal boolean
    flag that can be set via other methods like SetSuggestionSystemStatus().
  warnings: Ensure that the SupportMgr instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also, if the system status changes dynamically during runtime, consider caching
    the result if frequent checks are performed.
