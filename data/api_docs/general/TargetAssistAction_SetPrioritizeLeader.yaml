  method: SetPrioritizeLeader
  signature: void TargetAssistAction::SetPrioritizeLeader(bool prioritize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the target assist action should prioritize the group leader
    when selecting targets.
  description: The SetPrioritizeLeader method configures the behavior of the TargetAssistAction
    class to either prioritize or deprioritize the group leader when choosing a target
    for assistance. This functionality is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    within the TrinityCore framework, particularly for NPC behavior where the AI should
    consider the group leader's current target or status before selecting other potential
    targets. When enabled, the AI will prefer targeting the group leader if they are
    a valid target, otherwise it will proceed with normal target selection logic.
    This method does not validate whether the group leader is actually in the same
    group or alive; it simply sets the preference flag for use in subsequent target
    selection logic.
  parameters:
  - name: prioritize
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to prioritize the group leader.
      True enables prioritization, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Leader Prioritization
    code: 'TargetAssistAction action;

      action.SetPrioritizeLeader(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Leader Prioritization
    code: 'TargetAssistAction action;

      action.SetPrioritizeLeader(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only sets a flag that affects subsequent target selection behavior.
    It does not immediately change the current target or perform any target switching
    logic. The actual prioritization logic is implemented elsewhere in the TargetAssistAction
    class and depends on other factors such as target validity, threat levels, and
    group composition.
