documentation:
  brief: Destroys a Value object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The ~Value destructor is automatically invoked when a Value object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper cleanup
    of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the Value instance. In
    the context of TrinityCore's scripting and data handling systems, Value objects
    are commonly used to represent dynamic data types that may contain complex structures
    such as strings, numbers, or nested containers. The destructor guarantees that
    all internal allocations are freed appropriately to prevent memory leaks. This
    method does not require any parameters and performs no return operations.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'Value* value = new Value();

      // ... use the value object

      delete value; // Triggers ~Value destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Scope Cleanup
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    Value localVar();\n    // ... use localVar\n\
      } // ~Value automatically called here when localVar goes out of scope"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually unless explicitly managing object lifetime. It's important to
    ensure that Value objects are properly destroyed to avoid memory leaks, especially
    in long-running systems like World of Warcraft servers.
