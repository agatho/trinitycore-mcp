  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetFollowState
  signature: FollowState LeaderFollowBehavior::GetFollowState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current follow state of the leader-follower behavior.
  description: The GetFollowState method returns the FollowState enumeration that
    represents the current status of the leader-follower relationship within the AI
    system. This state indicates whether the follower is currently following, has
    stopped following, or is in a transitional state such as pausing or resuming the
    follow behavior. The method provides insight into the dynamic behavior of NPC
    followers and their adherence to leader commands in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FollowState enumeration value indicating the current state of the follow
    behavior. Possible values may include FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOWING, FOLLOW_STATE_STOPPED,
    FOLLOW_STATE_PAUSED, or other internal states depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Follow State
    code: "if (leaderFollowBehavior.GetFollowState() == FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOWING)\n\
      {\n    // Perform actions while following\n    // e.g., maintain distance from\
      \ leader\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making loops to determine appropriate
    behavior based on the current follow state. It should be called frequently during
    AI update cycles for responsive behavior.
