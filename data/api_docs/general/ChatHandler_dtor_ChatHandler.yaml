documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ChatHandler instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ChatHandler destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all resources allocated during the lifetime of a ChatHandler object. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory, closing connections if applicable,
    and ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of
    TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor ensures that player session data and
    command processing resources are correctly freed when a chat handler instance
    is no longer needed. The destructor is automatically invoked when the object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ChatHandler instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ChatHandler handler;\n    // ... use handler\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when handler goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of ChatHandler pointer
    code: 'ChatHandler* handler = new ChatHandler();

      // ... use handler ...

      delete handler; // Triggers destructor

      handler = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The ChatHandler destructor is typically invoked automatically by the C++
    runtime when objects go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should
    not manually call destructors unless implementing custom memory management patterns.
    In TrinityCore, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of command context and
    session-related data structures.
