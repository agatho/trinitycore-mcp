documentation:
  brief: Recruits participants for a guild event based on organizer and event ID.
  description: The RecruitEventParticipants method is responsible for gathering and
    enrolling players into a specified guild event. It takes an organizer reference
    and an event ID to determine which participants should be recruited. This method
    likely interacts with the guild's member list, event registration systems, and
    player notification mechanisms to ensure proper recruitment. The organizer parameter
    may represent a pointer to the player who initiated the event, while the eventId
    identifies the specific event being recruited for. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining active guild participation in organized events such as raids,
    dungeons, or social gatherings.
  parameters:
  - name: organizer
    description: Pointer to the player who initiated the guild event. This parameter
      likely represents the organizer's identifier or reference used to validate permissions
      and track event creation.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific guild event that participants
      are being recruited for. This ID is used to locate and process the correct event
      data within the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Recruitment
    code: 'Player* organizer = player; // Assume player is a valid Player object

      uint32 eventId = 1001;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.RecruitEventParticipants(&organizer, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation checks to ensure the organizer
    has permission to recruit participants and that the event ID corresponds to an
    active guild event. It may also trigger notifications or updates to the guild's
    event calendar.
  warnings: The organizer parameter must point to a valid Player object; otherwise,
    undefined behavior may occur. The eventId should correspond to an existing event,
    or the method might fail silently or throw an exception depending on implementation.
