  signature: std::vector<std::string> AIDecisionProfiler::GetCategoryOptimizationSuggestions(AIDecisionCategory
    category) const
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes AI decision-making categories and returns optimization suggestions
    for improving performance.
  description: The GetCategoryOptimizationSuggestions method evaluates the specified
    AI decision category and generates a list of actionable recommendations to optimize
    AI behavior. This method is typically used during profiling or debugging sessions
    to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in AI decision-making processes.
    The returned suggestions may include adjustments to decision weights, condition
    logic, or overall strategy implementation. The method does not modify any internal
    state but provides diagnostic feedback for developers working with AI systems
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: A vector of strings containing optimization suggestions for the specified
    AI decision category. Each string represents a distinct recommendation that can
    be applied to improve AI performance or behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Optimization Suggestions for Combat Category
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\nstd::vector<std::string> suggestions = profiler.GetCategoryOptimizationSuggestions(AIDecisionCategory::Combat);\n\
      for (const auto& suggestion : suggestions) {\n    std::cout << \"Suggestion:\
      \ \" << suggestion << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in development and debugging environments.
    It may perform analysis that could impact performance if called frequently during
    active gameplay. The suggestions returned are based on heuristics and may not
    always represent the optimal solution for every scenario.
  warnings: The method assumes valid AI decision categories have been passed; invalid
    category values may result in empty suggestion lists or undefined behavior. Do
    not rely on this method for runtime decision-making logic as it's designed for
    diagnostic purposes only.
