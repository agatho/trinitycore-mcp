  signature: void Spell::SendMountResult(int result)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a mount result message to the player's client indicating the success
    or failure of a mount attempt.
  description: The SendMountResult method is used to communicate the outcome of a
    mount spell activation to the player's client. It typically sends a specific result
    code that determines whether the player successfully mounted or encountered an
    error during the mounting process. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other mount-related functionality within the TrinityCore framework, such
    as handling mount spell effects and ensuring proper client synchronization. The
    method does not directly perform any mounting action but rather communicates the
    result of a mount attempt to the client.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: 'The result code indicating the outcome of the mount attempt. Valid
      values include: 0 (success), 1 (failure), 2 (no mount), 3 (invalid location),
      4 (no permission). The exact meaning depends on the context and specific implementation
      within the spell system.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mount Result Example
    code: 'void Spell::SendMountResult(0);

      // This sends a success result to the player''s client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Mount Result with Error Handling
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->SendMountResult(1);

      // This sends an error result indicating mount failure to the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called from within spell execution contexts and should
    be used in conjunction with proper spell handling logic. It's important to note
    that this method does not actually perform the mounting action itself but rather
    communicates the result of a mount attempt to the client. Implementation details
    may vary depending on the specific spell being executed.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as incorrect result codes can
    lead to client-side errors or unexpected behavior. The method should only be called
    after proper validation of mount conditions and should not be used in isolation
    without proper context handling.
