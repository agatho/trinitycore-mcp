documentation:
  brief: Compares two MovementRequest objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this MovementRequest
    object and another MovementRequest object to determine if they are not equal.
    It returns true if any of the member variables differ between the two objects,
    and false if all member variables are identical. This comparison is typically
    used in container operations or when checking for differences in movement requests
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method is const, meaning it does not modify
    either object during the comparison operation.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The MovementRequest object to compare against this instance
  returns: Returns true if the two MovementRequest objects are not equal, false otherwise.
    Two MovementRequest objects are considered equal if all their member variables
    have identical values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic inequality check
    code: 'MovementRequest request1;

      MovementRequest request2;

      bool areDifferent = (request1 != request2); // Returns true if requests differ'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic
    code: "if (playerMovementRequest != pendingMovementRequest) {\n    // Handle different\
      \ movement requests\n    playerMovementRequest = pendingMovementRequest;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented by comparing all relevant member variables
    of the MovementRequest class. The comparison may involve complex data structures
    or simple primitive types depending on the implementation. Since this is a const
    method, it can be safely called on const objects and does not modify the state
    of either object.
