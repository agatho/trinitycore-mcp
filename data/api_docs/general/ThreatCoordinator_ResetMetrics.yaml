  brief: Resets all threat metrics and clears the current threat state for the ThreatCoordinator.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated threat data and resets
    the internal state of the ThreatCoordinator. This function is typically invoked
    when a combat encounter ends or when the system needs to be reinitialized. It
    ensures that no stale threat information persists between different encounters
    or scenarios. The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations,
    serving purely as a cleanup utility for threat-related data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initializing a new threat calculation
    cycle to ensure clean state. It is generally safe to call during active combat
    if needed, but may cause temporary disruption in threat calculations.
