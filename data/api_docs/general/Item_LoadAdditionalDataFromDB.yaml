  class: Item
  method: LoadAdditionalDataFromDB
  signature: void Item::LoadAdditionalDataFromDB(const Player * owner, ItemAdditionalLoadInfo
    * addionalData)
documentation:
  brief: Loads additional data for an item from the database, including enchantments
    and gem information.
  description: This method retrieves additional data for an item from the database,
    such as enchantment details, gem information, and other item-specific properties
    that are not part of the base item data. It is typically called during item creation
    or when a player logs in to ensure all item attributes are properly loaded. The
    method requires a player owner and item additional data structure to properly
    load the information. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate
    item state and ensuring proper gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the Player object that owns the item. This parameter
      determines which player's data is used to load additional item information.
  - name: addionalData
    description: A pointer to an ItemAdditionalLoadInfo structure containing additional
      data needed for loading the item. This structure holds information about enchantments,
      gems, and other item properties that need to be loaded from the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item;

      Player* player = new Player;

      ItemAdditionalLoadInfo* additionalData = new ItemAdditionalLoadInfo;

      item->LoadAdditionalDataFromDB(player, additionalData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item;

      Player* player = new Player;

      ItemAdditionalLoadInfo* additionalData = new ItemAdditionalLoadInfo;

      item->LoadAdditionalDataFromDB(player, additionalData);

      // Ensure all enchantments and gems are properly loaded

      // This is typically called during item creation or player login'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during item initialization or when a player
    logs in. It involves database queries to retrieve item-specific data, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account. The method is thread-safe as long
    as the database connection is properly managed.
  warnings: Improper handling of the owner parameter or additionalData structure can
    lead to memory access violations or incorrect item data loading. Ensure that both
    parameters are valid and properly initialized before calling this method.
