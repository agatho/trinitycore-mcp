  class: GossipMenu
  method: GetMenuItems
  signature: const GossipMenuItemContainer & GossipMenu::GetMenuItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the container of gossip menu items associated with this GossipMenu
    instance.
  description: The GetMenuItems method provides access to the internal container that
    holds all the menu items for a specific gossip menu. This allows scripts and systems
    to iterate through or examine the available options presented to players during
    NPC interaction. The returned reference is const, ensuring that modifications
    to the menu items are not possible directly through this accessor. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with GossipMenu::AddMenuItem to build dynamic
    gossip menus based on player state or conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the GossipMenuItemContainer which holds all the
    menu items for this gossip menu. The container can be iterated over to access
    individual menu items, but modifications are not allowed through this interface.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating Through Menu Items
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    GossipMenu&\
      \ menu = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGossipMenu();\n    const GossipMenuItemContainer&\
      \ items = menu.GetMenuItems();\n    for (const auto& item : items)\n    {\n\
      \        // Process each gossip menu item\n        sLog->outString(\"Menu Item\
      \ ID: %u, Text: %s\", item.m_gossipOptionID, item.m_optionText.c_str());\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a const reference to an internal container. Modifying
    the contents of this container directly is not possible through this interface,
    which helps maintain data integrity. The returned container should not be stored
    or used beyond the scope where it's valid.
