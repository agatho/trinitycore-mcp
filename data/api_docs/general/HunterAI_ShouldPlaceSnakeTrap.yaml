  class: HunterAI
  method: ShouldPlaceSnakeTrap
  signature: bool HunterAI::ShouldPlaceSnakeTrap() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter should place a snake trap based on current
    combat conditions and spell availability.
  description: The ShouldPlaceSnakeTrap method evaluates the current state of the
    hunter's AI to decide if it is appropriate to deploy a snake trap. This decision
    takes into account factors such as the hunter's current target, available mana,
    cooldowns of relevant spells, and the presence of other traps or environmental
    conditions. The method is typically used within the HunterAI's decision-making
    loop to determine optimal trap placement timing. It ensures that snake traps are
    only placed when they will be effective and when resources allow for their deployment
    without compromising other tactical priorities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter AI determines it is appropriate to place a snake
    trap at this moment; otherwise, returns false. The decision considers spell cooldowns,
    mana availability, target conditions, and tactical positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->ShouldPlaceSnakeTrap()) {\n    // Attempt to place\
      \ snake trap\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SNAKE_TRAP, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Decision Making
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldPlaceSnakeTrap())\
      \ {\n        // Place trap logic here\n        DoPlaceSnakeTrap();\n    }\n\
      \    // Other AI updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the HunterAI's tactical decision-making system and
    should be called frequently during combat updates. It relies on internal state
    tracking of the hunter's current target, spell cooldowns, and resource levels.
    The implementation may vary depending on the specific AI behavior defined for
    different hunter classes or roles.
  warnings: This method does not directly cast spells or place traps; it only evaluates
    whether placement is appropriate. The actual trap placement logic must be implemented
    separately using the result of this method as a condition.
