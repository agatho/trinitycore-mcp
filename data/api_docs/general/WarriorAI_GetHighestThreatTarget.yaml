  class: WarriorAI
  method: GetHighestThreatTarget
  signature: ::Unit * WarriorAI::GetHighestThreatTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit with the highest threat level in the WarriorAI's current
    threat list.
  description: The GetHighestThreatTarget method retrieves the Unit object that currently
    holds the highest threat value within the WarriorAI's threat management system.
    This is typically used by warrior AI to determine which target should be attacked
    next based on threat generated. The method operates on the AI's internal threat
    table and returns a pointer to the Unit with the maximum threat, or nullptr if
    no valid targets exist. In the context of World of Warcraft's combat mechanics,
    this helps ensure that warriors focus their attacks on the most dangerous or threatening
    enemy in the vicinity.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ::Unit object with the highest threat level, or nullptr
    if no valid threat targets are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = warriorAI->GetHighestThreatTarget();\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    // Attack the highest threat target\n    warriorAI->AttackStart(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Usage with Null Check
    code: "Unit* highestTarget = warriorAI->GetHighestThreatTarget();\nif (highestTarget\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Ensure target is valid and alive before acting\n   \
      \ if (highestTarget->IsAlive() && highestTarget->IsInWorld()) {\n        warriorAI->AttackStart(highestTarget);\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // No threat targets available, possibly switch to default\
      \ behavior\n    warriorAI->DoNothing();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal threat management system which updates
    dynamically during combat. The returned Unit pointer is only valid while the target
    remains in the threat list and is not destroyed. If the warrior AI has no valid
    targets or all targets are dead, this method will return nullptr.
  warnings: Be sure to check for null returns before dereferencing the returned Unit
    pointer. Using an invalid pointer can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Also
    note that threat levels can change rapidly during combat, so caching the result
    of this method may not always be appropriate.
