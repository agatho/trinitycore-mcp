  signature: uint8 GameObject::GetGoAnimProgress() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current animation progress state of the game object.
  description: This method retrieves the animation progress value of a game object,
    which represents the current state of its visual animation. The returned value
    is typically used to determine whether an object is fully animated or still in
    transition. This is particularly relevant for objects like doors, chest, or other
    interactive elements where animation states are important for gameplay mechanics
    and visual feedback. The method returns a uint8 value indicating the progress
    level from 0 to 255, where 0 typically means no animation has started and 255
    indicates completion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the current animation progress state
    of the GameObject. Values range from 0 (no animation) to 255 (fully completed),
    with intermediate values indicating ongoing animation states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 progress = gameObject->GetGoAnimProgress();\nif (progress == 255)\n\
      {\n    // Object is fully animated\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Object is still animating\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other animation-related
    methods to determine the state of GameObjects during gameplay. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a simple getter method, but it should be used carefully
    in loops where frequent calls might occur.
  warnings: This method should not be used for determining object states in complex
    scenarios without understanding the underlying animation system. The value returned
    may vary based on the specific GameObject type and its animation state.
