  method: IsTradeEnabled
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsTradeEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether trading is enabled for the player bot.
  description: The IsTradeEnabled method checks the configuration settings to determine
    if trading functionality is active for a player bot. This method evaluates internal
    flags or configuration values that control whether the bot is allowed to engage
    in trade operations with other players or NPCs. The result of this check directly
    influences whether trade-related actions can be performed by the bot within the
    game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if trading is enabled for the player bot, false otherwise.
    This boolean value indicates the current state of the trade configuration setting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (playerBot->GetTradeConfig()->IsTradeEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ trade operations\n    playerBot->SendTradeRequest(targetPlayer);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Trading is disabled, skip trade actions\n    playerBot->SendChatMessage(\"\
      Trading is currently disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely reads from internal configuration variables or flags that
    may be set during bot initialization or updated through in-game settings. It's
    important to note that even if trading is enabled, additional checks such as distance,
    faction, and item restrictions may still prevent actual trade execution.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive return value guarantees successful trade
    completion; other game mechanics like range, faction neutrality, or item validity
    must also be verified before attempting trades. This method should only be used
    for configuration checks, not for direct trade initiation.
