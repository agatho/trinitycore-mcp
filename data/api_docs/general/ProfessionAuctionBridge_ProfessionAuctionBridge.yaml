  brief: Initializes the profession auction bridge system for handling auction house

  description: The ProfessionAuctionBridge constructor initializes the core functionality
    required for managing auction house transactions involving player professions.
    This method sets up internal data structures and registers necessary callbacks
    to handle profession-specific auction events such as item listings, bids, and
    sales. It ensures that all auction activities related to crafting professions
    are properly tracked and processed within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization
    process includes setting up event handlers for auction updates, preparing storage
    for profession-related auction data, and establishing communication channels with
    the main auction house system.
