  class: Player
  method: RemovedInsignia
  signature: void Player::RemovedInsignia(Player * looterPlr)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the insignia from a looter player's inventory.
  description: This method removes the insignia item from the specified looter player's
    inventory, typically used in the context of loot distribution mechanics within
    World of Warcraft. It ensures that the player no longer possesses the insignia
    item after it has been removed from their inventory, which is crucial for maintaining
    proper loot tracking and preventing duplicate loot distribution. The method operates
    under the assumption that the player has already been assigned the insignia item
    through a loot system, and this function handles the removal of that item from
    their inventory.
  parameters:
  - name: looterPlr
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose insignia should be removed.
      This parameter must not be null and represents the player who previously received
      the insignia item through loot distribution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* looter = new Player();

      // Assume looter has been assigned an insignia

      RemovedInsignia(looter);

      // looter no longer has the insignia item in their inventory'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during loot processing within the TrinityCore
    framework, where it ensures that players who have received an insignia item are
    properly removed from their inventory. It should be used carefully as part of
    a larger loot management system to prevent issues with duplicate loot or incorrect
    item distribution.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot tracking and may
    cause players to receive items they shouldn't have, or lose items they should
    have received. Always ensure that the player object passed is valid and has actually
    received an insignia item before calling this method.
