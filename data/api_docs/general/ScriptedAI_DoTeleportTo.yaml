  class: ScriptedAI
  method: DoTeleportTo
  signature: void ScriptedAI::DoTeleportTo(const float[4] pos)
documentation:
  brief: Teleports the AI-controlled creature to a specified location using the provided
    coordinates.
  description: The DoTeleportTo method initiates an immediate teleportation of the
    ScriptedAI's associated creature to a given position in the world. This function
    is typically used within AI scripts to move creatures to specific locations, such
    as during combat maneuvers, event triggers, or pathing behaviors. The teleportation
    occurs instantly without any movement animation or travel time. The method requires
    a position array containing X, Y, Z coordinates and an orientation value (in radians)
    for the target location. It is important to note that this method does not validate
    whether the destination is valid or walkable; it simply moves the creature to
    the specified coordinates.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An array of four floats representing [x, y, z, orientation] where
      x and y are the coordinates on the ground plane, z is the vertical height, and
      orientation is the facing angle in radians. The values should be within valid
      world bounds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic teleport to fixed location
    code: "void ExampleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n \
      \   {\n        float pos[4] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f};\n        DoTeleportTo(pos);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Teleport to random nearby location
    code: "void ExampleAI::DoRandomTeleport()\n{\n    float x = me->GetPositionX()\
      \ + (rand_norm() - 0.5f) * 10.0f;\n    float y = me->GetPositionY() + (rand_norm()\
      \ - 0.5f) * 10.0f;\n    float z = me->GetPositionZ();\n    float o = me->GetOrientation();\n\
      \    float pos[4] = {x, y, z, o};\n    DoTeleportTo(pos);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method bypasses normal movement restrictions and does not trigger any
    movement-related events or callbacks. It should be used carefully to avoid placing
    creatures in invalid locations such as inside walls or underwater. The orientation
    parameter is crucial for ensuring the creature faces the correct direction after
    teleportation.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation may result in creatures being
    teleported into solid geometry or other invalid positions. Always ensure that
    target coordinates are valid and accessible before calling DoTeleportTo. Avoid
    using this during critical combat sequences where precise positioning is required,
    as it may disrupt gameplay balance.
