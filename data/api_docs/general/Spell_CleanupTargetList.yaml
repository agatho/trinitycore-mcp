  brief: Clears and organizes the target list for spell effects, ensuring proper targeting
    and preventing duplicate entries.
  description: The CleanupTargetList method is responsible for managing the target
    list within a Spell object, removing duplicate targets and organizing the list
    according to game mechanics. This method ensures that each target is only processed
    once per spell effect, preventing potential issues such as double damage or incorrect
    targeting. It typically occurs during spell execution or when preparing spell
    effects for processing, and is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay balance
    and avoiding client-side errors.

  notes: This method should be called during spell preparation or execution to ensure
    proper target handling. It's typically invoked when the spell's target list needs
    to be organized before processing effects.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect targeting, duplicate
    damage, or missing targets in spell effects. Should not be called outside of appropriate
    spell contexts.
