  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: AddLayer
  signature: void NeuralNetwork::AddLayer(size_t neurons, ActivationFunction activation)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new layer to the neural network with the specified number of neurons
    and activation function.
  description: The AddLayer method is used to dynamically construct a neural network
    by appending a new layer. Each layer consists of a specified number of neurons
    and uses a defined activation function for computing outputs. This method allows
    developers to build complex neural architectures programmatically, which can be
    useful in AI-driven game mechanics such as NPC behavior modeling, decision-making
    systems, or adaptive difficulty algorithms. The method does not validate the network
    topology beyond basic parameter checks, so it's important to ensure that layer
    configurations are logically consistent for proper network operation.
  parameters:
  - name: neurons
    description: The number of neurons to include in the new layer. Must be a positive
      integer greater than zero.
  - name: activation
    description: The activation function to apply to each neuron in the layer. This
      determines how neuron outputs are computed and should match the expected input
      types for subsequent layers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Layer Addition
    code: 'NeuralNetwork nn;

      nn.AddLayer(10, ActivationFunction::ReLU);

      nn.AddLayer(5, ActivationFunction::Sigmoid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Building a Multi-Layer Network
    code: 'NeuralNetwork network;

      network.AddLayer(32, ActivationFunction::Tanh);

      network.AddLayer(16, ActivationFunction::ReLU);

      network.AddLayer(8, ActivationFunction::Sigmoid);

      network.AddLayer(1, ActivationFunction::Linear);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal structure of the neural network in-place.
    It is recommended to call this method before training or inference begins to avoid
    unexpected behavior during computation. The activation function enum should be
    properly defined within the project's AI subsystem.
  warnings: Adding layers after initializing weights or starting training may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that all layers are added sequentially and logically
    before using the network for computations.
