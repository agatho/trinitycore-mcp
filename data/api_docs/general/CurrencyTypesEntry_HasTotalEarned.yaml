  method: HasTotalEarned
  signature: bool CurrencyTypesEntry::HasTotalEarned() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the currency type has a total earned value configured.
  description: The HasTotalEarned method checks if the currency type entry has a valid
    total earned value assigned. This is typically used to verify if a specific currency
    can track the cumulative amount of currency earned by players over time. The method
    returns true if the currency type supports total earned tracking, and false otherwise.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this is often tied to currency
    types that are meant to be tracked across player sessions or achievements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the currency type has a configured total earned value;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Currency Supports Total Earned Tracking
    code: "if (currencyEntry->HasTotalEarned()) {\n    // Currency supports tracking\
      \ of total earned amount\n    printf(\"Currency %u tracks total earned\\n\"\
      , currencyEntry->ID);\n} else {\n    // Currency does not support total earned\
      \ tracking\n    printf(\"Currency %u does not track total earned\\n\", currencyEntry->ID);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with currency-related systems
    such as achievement tracking, player statistics, and reward distribution. It's
    important to note that the presence of a total earned value does not necessarily
    mean that the currency is actively tracked in-game, but rather that the system
    is capable of supporting such tracking.
