  signature: bool ProfessionManager::AutoLevelProfession(int * player, ProfessionType
    profession)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically levels a player's profession to the maximum achievable level
    based on their current character level and game progression.
  description: The AutoLevelProfession method in the ProfessionManager class is responsible
    for automatically advancing a player's specified profession to its highest possible
    level within the constraints of the game's progression system. This function typically
    checks the player's current level, available profession slots, and any prerequisite
    requirements before incrementally increasing the profession skill until it reaches
    the maximum allowable level for that character's level cap. The method ensures
    that the profession advancement aligns with the game's balancing mechanics and
    does not exceed the limits imposed by the TrinityCore server configuration or
    World of Warcraft expansion rules.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) in the game world. This parameter identifies which character's profession
      will be auto-leveled.
  - name: profession
    description: An enum value of type ProfessionType that specifies which profession
      should be auto-leveled. Valid values include common professions such as Mining,
      Herbalism, Blacksmithing, etc., depending on the TrinityCore implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the profession was successfully auto-leveled to its maximum
    achievable level; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters,
    missing prerequisites, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AutoLevelProfession Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType mining = PROFESSION_MINING;\nbool\
      \ success = sProfessionManager->AutoLevelProfession(&playerId, mining);\nif\
      \ (success) {\n    printf(\"Mining profession auto-leveled successfully.\\n\"\
      );\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to auto-level mining profession.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database operations to update player profession data
    and could be computationally intensive if processing multiple professions simultaneously.
    It is recommended to call this function during appropriate game events or in background
    threads to avoid blocking the main game loop.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    character, otherwise the method may fail silently or cause undefined behavior.
    Also, calling this method too frequently might trigger anti-cheat systems or server-side
    throttling mechanisms.
