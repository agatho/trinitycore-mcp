  class: LFGQueue
  method: AddQueueData
  signature: void LFGQueue::AddQueueData(int guid, time_t joinTime, const LfgDungeonSet
    & dungeons, const LfgRolesMap & rolesMap)
documentation:
  brief: Adds player queue data for LFG (Looking for Group) functionality including
    join time, selected dungeons, and roles.
  description: The AddQueueData method is used to register a player's information
    into the Looking for Group (LFG) queue system. It stores essential details such
    as the player's unique identifier (GUID), the time they joined the queue, the
    set of dungeons they are interested in, and their role preferences within those
    dungeons. This data is crucial for matching players with suitable groups during
    LFG operations. The method integrates with TrinityCore's LFG framework to manage
    group formation and dungeon matching mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player joining the LFG queue.
      This value must be a valid player GUID from the game database.
  - name: joinTime
    description: The timestamp indicating when the player joined the LFG queue. This
      is typically obtained using time() or similar time functions.
  - name: dungeons
    description: A set of dungeon IDs that the player wishes to join. These represent
      the dungeons they are interested in participating in for group matching.
  - name: rolesMap
    description: A mapping of player roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) to their
      preferences or availability for specific dungeons in the dungeon set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LfgDungeonSet dungeons;

      dungeons.insert(123);

      dungeons.insert(124);

      LfgRolesMap roles;

      roles[PLAYER_ROLE_TANK] = true;

      queue.AddQueueData(playerGuid, time(nullptr), dungeons, roles);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Dungeons and Roles
    code: 'LfgDungeonSet dungeons;

      dungeons.insert(123);

      dungeons.insert(124);

      dungeons.insert(125);

      LfgRolesMap roles;

      roles[PLAYER_ROLE_TANK] = true;

      roles[PLAYER_ROLE_HEALER] = false;

      roles[PLAYER_ROLE_DPS] = true;

      queue.AddQueueData(playerGuid, time(nullptr), dungeons, roles);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system when a player
    submits their queue request. Developers should ensure that dungeon IDs are valid
    and that role mappings conform to expected values within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Incorrect GUIDs or invalid dungeon IDs can lead to unexpected behavior
    in group matching. Ensure that all parameters are validated before calling this
    method.
