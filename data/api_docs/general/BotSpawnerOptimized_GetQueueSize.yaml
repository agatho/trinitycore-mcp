  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: GetQueueSize
  signature: uint32 BotSpawnerOptimized::GetQueueSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current size of the bot spawning queue in the optimized spawner.
  description: The GetQueueSize method retrieves the number of pending bot spawn requests
    currently queued for processing by the BotSpawnerOptimized class. This value represents
    how many bots are waiting to be spawned or initialized within the system, which
    can be useful for monitoring system load, debugging spawn issues, or implementing
    queue-based throttling mechanisms. The method is thread-safe and provides a snapshot
    of the queue at the time of invocation, making it suitable for real-time status
    reporting and performance analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pending bot spawn requests in
    the queue. Returns 0 if no bots are queued for spawning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Queue Status
    code: "uint32 queueSize = botSpawner.GetQueueSize();\nif (queueSize > 100)\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Warning: Bot spawn queue is large (%u bots queued)\"\
      , queueSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Queue Size for Performance
    code: "class BotSpawnMonitor\n{\npublic:\n    void CheckSpawnQueue(BotSpawnerOptimized&\
      \ spawner)\n    {\n        uint32 size = spawner.GetQueueSize();\n        if\
      \ (size > 500)\n        {\n            sLog->outError(\"Critical: Bot spawn\
      \ queue overflow detected (%u items)\", size);\n            // Implement throttling\
      \ or alerting logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only snapshot of the queue size and does not
    modify any internal state. It's recommended to use this method for monitoring
    purposes rather than making decisions based on its value, as the queue size may
    change immediately after the call. The implementation uses atomic operations to
    ensure thread safety when accessed from multiple threads.
  warnings: The returned queue size is a snapshot and may not reflect real-time changes.
    In high-concurrency scenarios, calling this method repeatedly in tight loops might
    introduce performance overhead. Avoid making critical system decisions based solely
    on queue size without considering other factors like spawn rate limits or system
    resources.
