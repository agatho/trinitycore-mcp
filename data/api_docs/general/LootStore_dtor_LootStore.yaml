documentation:
  brief: Destroys a LootStore instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The LootStore destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a LootStore object. This includes
    releasing any dynamically allocated memory used for storing loot templates, clearing
    internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the LootStore
    is no longer needed. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this destructor ensures proper cleanup of loot definitions that may be associated
    with creatures, game objects, or items. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when a LootStore object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of LootStore
    code: 'LootStore* lootStore = new LootStore("creature_loot_template");

      // ... use the loot store ...

      delete lootStore; // Triggers ~LootStore()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually invoke
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destructor
    assumes all internal data structures are properly initialized and may cause undefined
    behavior if called on a partially constructed object.
