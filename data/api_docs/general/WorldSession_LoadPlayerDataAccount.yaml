  signature: void WorldSession::LoadPlayerDataAccount(const int & elementsResult,
    const int & flagsResult)
documentation:
  brief: Loads player data associated with the account into the session.
  description: The LoadPlayerDataAccount method is responsible for retrieving and
    initializing player-related data from the database that is tied to the currently
    authenticated account. This method typically executes during the login process,
    fetching character information, account settings, and other relevant data needed
    to properly initialize a player's session within the World of Warcraft server
    environment. It processes results from database queries related to account and
    character data, ensuring all necessary information is available for gameplay operations.
  parameters:
  - name: elementsResult
    description: An integer parameter representing the result code or identifier from
      a database query operation related to account elements. This value likely indicates
      success, failure, or specific status codes for the data retrieval process.
  - name: flagsResult
    description: An integer parameter that contains flag values indicating various
      states or properties of the loaded player data. These flags may control access
      permissions, account restrictions, or other configuration settings related to
      the player's session.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in login flow
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleLogin(WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n    // ... authentication\
      \ logic ...\n    int elementsResult = 0;\n    int flagsResult = 0;\n    LoadPlayerDataAccount(elementsResult,\
      \ flagsResult);\n    // ... continue with session initialization ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the authentication and session
    setup sequence. It's important to note that this method does not directly handle
    network communication but rather processes database results to populate internal
    session state.
  warnings: Improper handling of elementsResult or flagsResult values can lead to
    incorrect player data loading, potentially causing login failures or inconsistent
    gameplay states. Ensure proper validation of database query outcomes before calling
    this method.
