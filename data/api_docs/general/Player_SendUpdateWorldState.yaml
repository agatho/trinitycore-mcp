  signature: void Player::SendUpdateWorldState(uint32 variable, uint32 value, bool
    hidden) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a world state update to the player's client, displaying or updating
    a UI element with the specified variable and value.
  description: The SendUpdateWorldState method is used to send a world state update
    packet to a specific player's client. This method allows the server to dynamically
    update UI elements such as quest progress, timers, or other game state information
    displayed on the player's screen. The method takes a variable identifier and its
    corresponding value, and can optionally hide the update from the player's UI if
    the hidden flag is set to true. World states are commonly used in World of Warcraft
    for displaying dynamic information like holiday event timers, quest objectives,
    or arena match status. This method directly communicates with the client's UI
    system through the WorldStateUpdate opcode, ensuring that the player sees real-time
    updates without requiring a full UI refresh.
  parameters:
  - name: variable
    description: The unique identifier for the world state variable to update. This
      value determines which UI element or display slot will be updated on the client
      side.
  - name: value
    description: The numeric value to assign to the specified world state variable.
      This value is typically used to represent progress, counts, or status indicators
      in the UI.
  - name: hidden
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the update should be hidden from
      the player's UI. When true, the client will not display the update even though
      it receives the packet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Quest Progress Display
    code: player->SendUpdateWorldState(QUEST_PROGRESS_VARIABLE, 50, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Hide Timer from Player UI
    code: player->SendUpdateWorldState(ARENA_TIMER_VARIABLE, 300, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for updating UI elements that are defined in
    the client's world state system. The variable IDs should match those defined in
    the game's client-side configuration or database entries. Performance-wise, this
    method sends a network packet to the player, so frequent calls should be avoided
    for high-frequency updates. The hidden parameter allows for server-side state
    management without cluttering the player's UI.
  warnings: Calling this method on a disconnected player will have no effect. Ensure
    that variable IDs are valid and correspond to actual UI elements defined in the
    client. Using invalid variable IDs may cause unexpected behavior or client-side
    errors. Avoid sending updates too frequently as it can impact network performance.
