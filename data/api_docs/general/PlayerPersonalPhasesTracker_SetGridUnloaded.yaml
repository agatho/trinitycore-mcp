  class: PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
  method: SetGridUnloaded
  signature: void PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker::SetGridUnloaded(uint32 gridId)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a grid as unloaded for the player's personal phases tracking.
  description: The SetGridUnloaded method is used to notify the PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
    that a specific grid has been unloaded from memory. This is typically called when
    a player moves out of a grid's range or when the grid is explicitly unloaded by
    the server. The method updates internal tracking structures to ensure that phase-related
    data is properly managed for the unloaded grid, preventing potential issues with
    stale or invalid phase information. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    accurate personal phase states in areas where grids are dynamically loaded and
    unloaded during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: gridId
    description: The unique identifier of the grid that has been unloaded. This value
      represents a specific grid within the game world's spatial partitioning system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when unloading a grid
    code: 'PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker* tracker = player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker();

      tracker->SetGridUnloaded(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a grid is unloaded to maintain consistency
    in personal phase tracking. It's typically invoked internally by the core game
    systems when grid unload events occur, but may also be called manually in special
    circumstances.
