api:
  class: LootCoordination
  method: LearnFromCoordinationOutcomes
  signature: void LootCoordination::LearnFromCoordinationOutcomes(Group * group, const
    LootSession & session)
documentation:
  brief: Processes loot coordination outcomes from a group session to update player
    loot preferences and behavior.
  description: The LearnFromCoordinationOutcomes method analyzes the results of a
    loot coordination session within a group, updating internal state based on how
    players participated in the loot distribution process. This includes tracking
    player participation, loot decisions, and potential changes to future loot allocation
    strategies. The method operates on the provided group and session data, adjusting
    internal loot coordination logic to improve fairness and efficiency in subsequent
    loot distributions. It is typically invoked after a loot session has concluded
    and outcomes have been determined.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who participated in
      the loot coordination session. Must be a valid group with active members.
  - name: session
    description: Reference to the LootSession object representing the completed loot
      coordination session. Contains outcome data and decision records for all participants.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Coordination Context
    code: "void HandleLootSessionEnd(Group* group, const LootSession& session)\n{\n\
      \    LootCoordination coordination;\n    coordination.LearnFromCoordinationOutcomes(group,\
      \ session);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Loot Management System
    code: "void ProcessGroupLootOutcome(Group* group, const LootSession& session)\n\
      {\n    if (group && !session.IsEmpty())\n    {\n        LootCoordination coordination;\n\
      \        coordination.LearnFromCoordinationOutcomes(group, session);\n     \
      \   // Update group loot settings based on learned outcomes\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state related to player behavior tracking and
    should only be called after a complete loot session has been finalized. It assumes
    that the provided Group and LootSession objects are valid and contain up-to-date
    information about player decisions and outcomes.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or null group/session pointers may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the session contains proper outcome
    data before invoking this method.
