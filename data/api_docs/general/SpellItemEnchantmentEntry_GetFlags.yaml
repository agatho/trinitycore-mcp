documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a spell item enchantment entry
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags defined for a specific spell item enchantment. These flags typically
    define various properties and behaviors of the enchantment, such as whether it
    can be applied to certain item types, if it has special restrictions, or if it
    should trigger specific game mechanics. The returned value is a combination of
    bit flags that can be tested using bitwise operations to determine individual
    flag states. This method is commonly used in the context of item enchantment validation
    and application logic within TrinityCore's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flag bits for the spell item enchantment.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific property or restriction
    defined for the enchantment, such as allowed item classes, activation conditions,
    or special behaviors. The exact meaning of each flag bit is defined by the game's
    internal flag definitions and should be interpreted using bitwise operations.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an enchantment has a specific flag
    code: "SpellItemEnchantmentEntry* entry = sSpellMgr->GetSpellItemEnchantment(entryId);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & ENCHANTMENT_FLAG_VISIBLE)\n\
      \    {\n        // Enchantment is visible to players\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating enchantment applicability based on flags
    code: "SpellItemEnchantmentEntry* entry = sSpellMgr->GetSpellItemEnchantment(entryId);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    // Check if enchantment\
      \ can be applied to weapons\n    if (flags & ENCHANTMENT_FLAG_WEAPON)\n    {\n\
      \        // Proceed with weapon-specific enchantment logic\n    }\n    // Check\
      \ if enchantment is temporary\n    if (!(flags & ENCHANTMENT_FLAG_PERMANENT))\n\
      \    {\n        // Apply temporary duration handling\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned flags value represents a bitmask that should be interpreted
    using bitwise operations. The exact flag definitions are internal to TrinityCore
    and may vary between different versions or patches. Developers should consult
    the game's source code or documentation for specific flag meanings. This method
    is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable data structures.
  warnings: Be cautious when directly comparing the returned integer value against
    hardcoded flag values without proper bitwise operations. Always use bitwise AND
    (&) to test individual flags rather than equality comparisons. The flag definitions
    may change between TrinityCore versions, so code relying on specific flag values
    should be carefully maintained during updates.
