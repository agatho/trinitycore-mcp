  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::UpdateRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Demon Hunter's combat rotation based on current target and spell
    availability
  description: The UpdateRotation method manages the core combat logic for a Demon
    Hunter AI, determining which abilities to cast next based on the current target
    and available spells. This method evaluates the player's current state including
    mana levels, cooldowns, and target conditions to select optimal actions within
    the Demon Hunter's rotation. It typically integrates with the AI's decision-making
    system to ensure proper spell sequencing and resource management during combat
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target object that the Demon Hunter AI will evaluate
      for rotation decisions. This parameter represents the current combat target
      which influences spell selection and priority.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateRotation Usage
    code: "void UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target)\n        return;\n\
      \    \n    // Core rotation logic would be implemented here\n    // Evaluate\
      \ target and cast appropriate spells\n}\n\n// Called during AI update cycle\n\
      DemonHunterAI* ai = GetDemonHunterAI();\nai->UpdateRotation(&currentTarget);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called within the Demon Hunter's AI update loop
    and should be invoked regularly during combat. The target parameter may be null
    during idle states or when no valid target exists, so proper null checking is
    required.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target parameter points to a valid object
    with appropriate combat state information. Calling this method without a properly
    initialized target can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
