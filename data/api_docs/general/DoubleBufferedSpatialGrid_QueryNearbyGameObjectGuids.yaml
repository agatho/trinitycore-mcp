  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: QueryNearbyGameObjectGuids
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::QueryNearbyGameObjectGuids(const int &
    pos, float radius) const
documentation:
  brief: Queries and returns the GUIDs of nearby game objects within a specified radius
    from a given position.
  description: The QueryNearbyGameObjectGuids method retrieves all GameObject GUIDs
    located within a defined spherical area around a specified position. It is commonly
    used in spatial queries for detecting interactable objects, triggers, or environmental
    elements near a player or NPC. The method operates on a double-buffered grid system
    which ensures thread-safe access to spatial data during concurrent operations.
    This function does not modify any internal state and is typically called as part
    of AI logic, quest systems, or object interaction routines.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position (as an integer index) in the spatial grid from which
      to query nearby game objects. This index represents a cell within the double-buffered
      grid structure.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the spherical area around the specified position to
      search for game objects. Units are typically in grid cell sizes or world units
      depending on implementation.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of GameObject GUIDs found within
    the specified radius. A return value of zero indicates no matching objects were
    found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby game objects
    code: "int count = grid.QueryNearbyGameObjectGuids(playerPositionIndex, 5.0f);\n\
      if (count > 0) {\n    // Process the returned GUIDs\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to iterate through found game object GUIDs
    code: "int count = grid.QueryNearbyGameObjectGuids(npcPositionIndex, 10.0f);\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {\n    uint64 guid = grid.GetGameObjectGuid(i);\n\
      \    // Perform actions with the GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe due to its double-buffered grid
    implementation. It uses internal caching and spatial partitioning for performance
    optimization. The 'pos' parameter should refer to a valid index within the grid
    bounds, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Incorrectly using an invalid position index may lead to memory access
    violations or incorrect results. Ensure that radius values are positive and reasonable
    for performance reasons. This method does not perform any filtering on returned
    GUIDs; additional logic might be required to filter by type or state.
