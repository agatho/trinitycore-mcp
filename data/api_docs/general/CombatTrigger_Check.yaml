documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a combat trigger condition is met for the given bot AI
    instance
  description: The Check method determines if a specific combat trigger condition
    has been satisfied within the context of a bot's AI behavior. It assesses various
    factors such as target availability, health status, threat levels, and combat
    readiness to decide whether the trigger should activate. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with AI decision-making systems to control when bots enter
    or exit combat states. The evaluation considers the current state of the AI's
    associated unit and its environment to make an informed decision about combat
    engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat trigger condition is met and the trigger should
    activate, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the bot's AI
    should proceed with the combat-related action or behavior defined by this trigger.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (trigger.Check(ai)) {\n    ai->SetCombatState(true);\n    // Execute\
      \ combat actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Tree
    code: "class MyCombatTrigger : public CombatTrigger {\npublic:\n    bool Check(BotAI*\
      \ ai) const override {\n        if (!ai || !ai->GetBot()) return false;\n  \
      \      Unit* target = ai->GetBot()->GetVictim();\n        return target && target->IsInWorld()\
      \ && target->IsAlive();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called frequently during AI processing cycles,
    so performance considerations are important. The implementation should avoid expensive
    operations or database queries that could impact frame rate. The method relies
    on the BotAI parameter being valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI parameter passed to this method is not null and
    represents a valid bot context. Calling Check with an invalid AI pointer may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes that all necessary combat
    state information is accessible through the provided AI interface.
