documentation:
  brief: Records the completion of a raid instance in the group coordinator system
  description: The RecordRaidComplete method is responsible for logging and tracking
    the successful completion of a raid encounter within the GroupCoordinator framework.
    This method typically updates internal state or database records to indicate that
    a raid instance has been completed by the group. It may also trigger related events
    such as reward distribution, achievement updates, or progression tracking. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations,
    serving instead as a marker for raid completion events within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Raid Completion Handler
    code: "void OnRaidComplete()\n{\n    GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinatorForPlayer(player);\n\
      \    if (coordinator)\n    {\n        coordinator->RecordRaidComplete();\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a raid encounter reaches its successful
    conclusion, and it's expected that all raid members have been properly accounted
    for in the group. The implementation may involve database writes or internal state
    updates that could impact performance if called excessively during active raid
    events.
  warnings: Ensure this method is only called after verifying that the raid has actually
    completed successfully, as incorrect invocation may lead to invalid progression
    tracking or reward distribution issues. This method should not be invoked during
    ongoing raid encounters or while players are still in combat.
