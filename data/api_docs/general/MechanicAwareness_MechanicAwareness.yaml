documentation:
  brief: Initializes the MechanicAwareness class with default values for tracking
    mechanic-related events.
  description: The MechanicAwareness constructor initializes internal state variables
    used to track and respond to various game mechanics such as stun, root, silence,
    and other debuffs. This class is typically used within AI systems or event handlers
    to determine how creatures or players should react when affected by specific mechanical
    effects. The initialization sets up default awareness levels and prepares the
    object for monitoring mechanic application and removal events during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a MechanicAwareness instance
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      // The object is now initialized and ready to track mechanic events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or external
    API calls. It simply sets up internal tracking variables. The actual mechanic
    detection logic is typically handled by other methods in the class that are called
    during game events.
