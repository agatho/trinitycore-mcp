  signature: void TargetSelector::~TargetSelector()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TargetSelector instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~TargetSelector destructor is automatically invoked when a TargetSelector
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, and references held
    by the target selector. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this typically
    involves releasing any cached target information, clearing internal state, and
    ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The destructor is a critical part of the
    object lifecycle management and should never be called manually unless explicitly
    needed for resource cleanup in custom implementations.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of TargetSelector
    code: "void SomeAIUpdate()\n{\n    TargetSelector selector;\n    // ... use selector\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when selector goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual deletion in dynamic allocation
    code: 'TargetSelector* selector = new TargetSelector();

      // ... use selector ...

      delete selector; // Triggers destructor

      selector = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked directly. It's important to ensure that any pointers to TargetSelector
    objects are properly managed to avoid memory leaks or undefined behavior. The
    destructor may perform cleanup operations that depend on the internal state of
    the AI system, so it should only be called on fully constructed objects.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually unless you're implementing custom memory
    management. Calling ~TargetSelector() directly on an object that hasn't been properly
    constructed or has already been destroyed leads to undefined behavior. Also, ensure
    that no other code holds references to the object being destroyed, as this may
    cause dangling pointer issues.
