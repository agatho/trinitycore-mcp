  signature: void UpdateFetcher::RenameEntry(const std::string & from, const std::string
    & to) const
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal mapping to rename a player entry from one name to another.
  description: 'The RenameEntry method is used to update an internal mapping within
    the UpdateFetcher class that tracks player name changes. This method allows the
    system to maintain accurate references when a player''s character name is changed
    in the game world. It typically operates on cached or indexed data structures
    that store player identifiers and their corresponding names. The method does not
    directly interact with the database but modifies in-memory mappings for efficient
    lookup operations. Precondition: Both ''from'' and ''to'' parameters must represent
    valid, non-empty strings. Postcondition: The internal mapping will reflect the
    new name association.'
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The original player name that needs to be renamed. Must be a non-empty
      string representing an existing character name in the system.
  - name: to
    description: The new player name to which the original name should be updated.
      Must be a non-empty string and must not already exist as a mapping key.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rename Usage
    code: 'UpdateFetcher fetcher;

      fetcher.RenameEntry("OldPlayerName", "NewPlayerName");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Rename with Validation Check
    code: "UpdateFetcher fetcher;\nif (!oldName.empty() && !newName.empty()) {\n \
      \   fetcher.RenameEntry(oldName, newName);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ input\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with player name change events
    or during server maintenance operations. It's important to ensure that the 'to'
    parameter does not already exist as a key in the mapping to prevent data conflicts.
    The implementation likely uses hash maps or similar data structures for O(1) lookup
    performance.
  warnings: Calling this method with duplicate 'to' values may cause unexpected behavior
    or data loss if not properly validated beforehand. Ensure thread safety when calling
    this method concurrently, as it modifies shared internal state.
