documentation:
  brief: Initiates movement along a specified waypoint path with configurable options
    for repetition, speed, and behavior.
  description: The MovePath method instructs an AI-controlled unit to follow a predefined
    sequence of waypoints. It supports various movement configurations including whether
    the path should repeat, how long the movement should last, and how speed is selected.
    The method allows for advanced behaviors such as waiting at path ends, wandering
    after reaching the end, and following the path in reverse order. This functionality
    is commonly used for scripted creature movement in World of Warcraft instances
    or quests.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: Reference to a WaypointPath object containing the sequence of waypoints
      the unit will follow.
  - name: repeatable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the path should loop continuously
      (true) or execute once (false).
  - name: duration
    description: Total duration in milliseconds for which the movement should occur.
      A value of 0 means no time limit.
  - name: speed
    description: Base speed value used for movement, typically expressed in yards
      per second or similar unit depending on implementation.
  - name: speedSelectionMode
    description: Enumeration value specifying how the actual movement speed is determined
      from the base speed (e.g., walk, run, custom).
  - name: waitTimeRangeAtPathEnd
    description: Time range in milliseconds to wait at the end of the path before
      continuing or looping. If 0, no waiting occurs.
  - name: wanderDistanceAtPathEnds
    description: Maximum distance in yards the unit may wander from the final waypoint
      after completing the path.
  - name: followPathBackwardsFromEndToStart
    description: Integer flag indicating whether to reverse the path direction upon
      reaching the end (1 = yes, 0 = no).
  - name: exactSplinePath
    description: Flag determining if the movement should strictly follow a predefined
      spline path (1 = yes, 0 = no).
  - name: generatePath
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to automatically generate the path
      based on waypoints if not already defined.
  - name: param10
    description: Reserved or additional parameter; behavior depends on internal implementation
      and may be unused in some contexts.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Movement
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      WaypointPath path = GetCustomPath();

      mm->MovePath(path, false, 0, 3.0f, MOVEMENT_WALK_SPEED, 0, 0, 0, 0, false, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Repeating Path with Wait and Wander
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      WaypointPath path = GetQuestPath();

      mm->MovePath(path, true, 10000, 2.5f, MOVEMENT_RUN_SPEED, 2000, 5.0f, 0, 0,
      true, 0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the motion state of the unit and should not be called
    during critical AI processing phases where movement might conflict with other
    behaviors. It internally uses spline-based interpolation for smooth movement along
    waypoints.
  warnings: Calling MovePath while another movement is active may result in unexpected
    behavior or override previous movement commands. Ensure that the provided WaypointPath
    is valid and fully initialized before calling this method.
