documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG join result message to the client with details about the player's
    LFG queue status.
  description: The SendLfgJoinResult method is used by the WorldSession class to communicate
    the outcome of a player's attempt to join a Looking for Group (LFG) dungeon or
    activity. This method sends a structured message to the connected client containing
    information about whether the join was successful, any errors encountered, and
    details about the LFG queue state. The method is typically called after processing
    LFG join requests from players, providing feedback on their queue status and helping
    maintain synchronization between the server and client regarding group finding
    activities.
  parameters:
  - name: joinData
    description: A constant reference to an LfgJoinResultData structure containing
      all relevant information about the LFG join attempt, including result code,
      queue details, and any error messages.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SendLfgJoinResult
    code: 'lfg::LfgJoinResultData joinData;

      joinData.result = LFG_JOIN_RESULT_SUCCESS;

      joinData.dungeonId = 1234;

      joinData.queueType = LFG_QUEUE_DUNGEON;

      this->SendLfgJoinResult(joinData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called when processing
    LFG join requests. It directly sends a packet to the client, so it's important
    that the data passed in joinData is valid and properly formatted to avoid client-side
    errors or disconnects.
