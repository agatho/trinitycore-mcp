documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player has sufficient gold to cover a specified amount
  description: "The CheckMoney method verifies if the provided player character possesses\
    \ enough monetary resources to fulfill a given transaction amount. This validation\
    \ is commonly used in bot logic and automated trading systems within TrinityCore\
    \ to prevent invalid transactions. The method checks against the player's current\
    \ gold balance, ensuring that the requested amount does not exceed their available\
    \ funds. It returns true if the player has sufficient funds, false otherwise.\
    \ This check is essential for maintaining game economy integrity and preventing\
    \ exploitation through\u865A\u5047\u4EA4\u6613 or invalid monetary operations."
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character whose gold
      balance will be checked
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of gold (in copper units) that needs to be validated against
      the player's balance
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient gold to cover the specified amount,
    false if they do not have enough funds
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Gold Validation
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player\nuint32 requiredGold\
      \ = 100000; // 10 gold pieces in copper\nif (InteractionValidator().CheckMoney(myBot,\
      \ requiredGold)) {\n    // Proceed with transaction\n    printf(\"Player has\
      \ sufficient funds\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle insufficient funds\n    printf(\"\
      Player lacks sufficient funds\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in Trading Logic
    code: "class BotTradeSystem {\npublic:\n    bool AttemptPurchase(Player* buyer,\
      \ uint32 itemCost) {\n        InteractionValidator validator;\n        if (validator.CheckMoney(buyer,\
      \ itemCost)) {\n            // Deduct cost from player\n            buyer->ModifyMoney(-static_cast<int32>(itemCost));\n\
      \            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's current gold balance and does not account
    for any temporary modifications or pending transactions. The amount parameter
    is expected to be in copper units (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold).
    This validation is typically used in conjunction with other checks such as item
    availability or inventory space.
  warnings: This method only validates the gold amount and does not perform any actual
    monetary deduction. It should be paired with appropriate money modification functions
    if a transaction is to proceed. Be cautious when using this in high-frequency
    operations as it may involve database reads for player data.
