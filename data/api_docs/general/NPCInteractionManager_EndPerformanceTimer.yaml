  brief: Ends the performance timer for NPC interaction events
  description: The EndPerformanceTimer method terminates the currently active performance
    monitoring timer within the NPCInteractionManager. This method is typically invoked
    after an NPC interaction sequence has completed to record and log the duration
    of the interaction. It ensures that timing data is properly finalized and can
    be used for debugging, optimization, or analytics purposes. The method does not
    accept any parameters and performs no return operations.

    using StartPerformanceTimer. Failure to do so may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect timing data.
