  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: RecordBossKill
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::RecordBossKill(Creature * boss)
documentation:
  brief: Records a boss kill event for the AdvancedBehaviorManager to track and manage
    boss encounter data.
  description: The RecordBossKill method is used to log the completion of a boss encounter
    within the AdvancedBehaviorManager system. This method typically updates internal
    tracking mechanisms to record that a specific creature (boss) has been defeated.
    It may trigger additional behavior such as updating quest progress, awarding loot,
    or modifying game state variables related to the boss fight. The method is generally
    called when a boss creature's health reaches zero and all associated combat mechanics
    have concluded. This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate encounter
    logs and ensuring proper progression through content that requires defeating specific
    bosses.
  parameters:
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the boss that was killed.
      Must be a valid pointer to a creature with boss-level AI behavior, typically
      a creature with specific boss flags or encounter IDs set in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Kill Recording
    code: "void OnBossDeath(Creature* boss)\n{\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->RecordBossKill(boss);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Kill with Additional Logic
    code: "void OnCreatureKilled(Creature* killedCreature, Unit* killer) override\n\
      {\n    if (killedCreature->IsBoss())\n    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->RecordBossKill(killedCreature);\n\
      \        // Additional logic for boss-specific rewards or events\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal encounter tracking systems and
    may update database records or in-memory structures that store boss kill data.
    It should be called only after the boss has fully completed its death animation
    and all related combat events have been processed to ensure accurate logging.
  warnings: Ensure that the boss parameter is a valid Creature pointer before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    The method assumes the boss is already defeated and should not be called during
    active combat.
