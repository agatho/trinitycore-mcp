  method: SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID
  signature: void Player::SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID(int raid_difficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the legacy raid difficulty ID for the player.
  description: This method configures the player's legacy raid difficulty setting,
    which determines the default difficulty level for legacy raid instances. The method
    affects how the player's character interacts with legacy raid content in World
    of Warcraft, particularly when accessing older raid content that was previously
    available at different difficulty levels. This setting is used primarily for compatibility
    purposes and does not affect current raid difficulty settings.
  parameters:
  - name: raid_difficulty
    description: The raid difficulty ID to set for the player. Valid values are 0
      (normal), 1 (heroic), or 2 (lfr). This corresponds to legacy raid difficulty
      settings used in older expansions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Legacy Raid Difficulty
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID(1); // Set to heroic difficulty'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for compatibility with legacy raid content.
    The setting does not affect current raid difficulty levels, and players must manually
    adjust their difficulty settings when accessing new raid content.
  warnings: This method should only be called when explicitly needed for compatibility
    with legacy raid content. Setting incorrect values may cause issues with accessing
    certain raid instances.
