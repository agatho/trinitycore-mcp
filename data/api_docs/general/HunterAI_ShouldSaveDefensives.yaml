  class: HunterAI
  method: ShouldSaveDefensives
  signature: bool HunterAI::ShouldSaveDefensives() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter should save defensive abilities for later use.
  description: The ShouldSaveDefensives method evaluates the current combat situation
    to decide if defensive abilities such as Trap Launcher or Feign Death should be
    reserved for future use rather than consumed immediately. This decision is based
    on factors like the hunter's health percentage, incoming damage threat, and the
    presence of critical enemies. The method is typically used within the AI logic
    to optimize ability usage and ensure survival during high-risk encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if defensive abilities should be saved for later use; returns
    false if it is safe or beneficial to use them immediately.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (!hunterAI->ShouldSaveDefensives()) {\n    // Use defensive ability\
      \ now\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FEIGN_DEATH, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (ShouldSaveDefensives())\
      \ {\n        // Avoid using defensives in this situation\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // Proceed with normal AI behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making logic and may be overridden
    or extended by custom AI implementations. It relies on internal state tracking
    of the hunter's health, threat level, and target information.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to suboptimal combat performance.
    Ensure that all relevant conditions are properly evaluated before making decisions
    based on its return value.
