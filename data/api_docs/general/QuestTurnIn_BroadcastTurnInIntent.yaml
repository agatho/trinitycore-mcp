  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: BroadcastTurnInIntent
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::BroadcastTurnInIntent(Group * group, uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts a quest turn-in intent to a group, notifying members of the quest
    completion status.
  description: The BroadcastTurnInIntent method sends a message to all members of
    a specified group indicating that a player has initiated or completed a quest
    turn-in. This functionality is typically used in automated questing systems or
    botting scenarios where a group member (often a 'bot') completes a quest and needs
    to inform the rest of the group about the progress. The method ensures that group
    members are aware of quest status changes without requiring manual updates from
    each player. It's commonly utilized in TrinityCore's AI and automation frameworks
    for managing shared quest objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group to which the turn-in
      intent should be broadcasted. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest being turned in. Used to identify
      which specific quest status is being updated for group members.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player who has
      completed the quest turn-in. This player's status will be broadcasted to the
      group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In Intent Broadcasting
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestTurnIn::BroadcastTurnInIntent(myGroup, questId, player);

      // Broadcasts to all group members that player has turned in quest 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Bot System Integration
    code: "if (bot && bot->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE)\n{\n\
      \    Group* group = bot->GetGroup();\n    if (group)\n    {\n        QuestTurnIn::BroadcastTurnInIntent(group,\
      \ questId, bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in automated questing systems and AI frameworks
    within TrinityCore. It leverages the group's messaging system to broadcast quest
    status updates. The method assumes that the provided parameters are valid and
    not null, as it does not perform null checks internally.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null group pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that
    the questId corresponds to an actual quest in the game database to avoid confusion
    among group members.
