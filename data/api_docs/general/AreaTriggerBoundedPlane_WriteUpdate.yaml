  method: WriteUpdate
  signature: void AreaTriggerBoundedPlane::WriteUpdate(ByteBuffer & data, bool ignoreChangesMask,
    const AreaTrigger * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes area trigger bounded plane data into a byte buffer for client
    updates.
  description: The WriteUpdate method serializes the state of an AreaTriggerBoundedPlane
    object into a ByteBuffer, which is then sent to a specific player's client. This
    method is typically invoked during area trigger updates or when sending initial
    trigger data to players entering the trigger zone. It handles serialization of
    the bounded plane's properties such as dimensions, orientation, and position relative
    to the owner area trigger. The ignoreChangesMask parameter allows bypassing change
    tracking for full data synchronization, while the owner and receiver parameters
    provide context for proper serialization based on player visibility and trigger
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized area trigger bounded
      plane data will be written. This buffer is subsequently sent to the client.
  - name: ignoreChangesMask
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to ignore the change mask when serializing
      data. If true, all fields are serialized regardless of their changed status.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger that owns this bounded plane. Used to
      determine context for serialization and visibility rules.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player who will receive the serialized data. Used
      to apply player-specific filtering or adjustments during serialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in area trigger update
    code: 'ByteBuffer updateData;

      AreaTriggerBoundedPlane* boundedPlane = ...; // Get reference to bounded plane

      AreaTrigger* ownerTrigger = ...; // Get the owning trigger

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player receiving update

      boundedPlane->WriteUpdate(updateData, false, ownerTrigger, targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forcing full data synchronization
    code: 'ByteBuffer fullUpdate;

      AreaTriggerBoundedPlane* boundedPlane = ...;

      AreaTrigger* owner = ...;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      boundedPlane->WriteUpdate(fullUpdate, true, owner, receiver); // Ignore change
      mask for complete sync'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's area trigger system and is typically
    called internally by the server when updating players about area trigger states.
    The serialization process respects player visibility rules and may include additional
    filtering based on the receiver's current state or proximity to the trigger.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid owner or receiver pointer can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that all parameters are valid before invoking this
    method, especially in performance-critical code paths where multiple triggers
    might be updated simultaneously.
