  method: GetMembersSize
  signature: size_t ArenaTeam::GetMembersSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of members currently in the arena team.
  description: The GetMembersSize method retrieves the total count of players who
    are currently part of the arena team. This value represents the active roster
    size and can be used to determine if the team has reached its maximum capacity
    or to iterate through all members. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    arena teams have specific size limits based on the type of arena (2v2, 3v3, 5v5),
    and this method provides access to that count for game logic and UI purposes.
    The returned value is guaranteed to be non-negative and reflects the current state
    of the team's membership.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the number of members currently in the arena
    team. This value will be zero if the team has no members, and will correspond
    to the maximum allowed size for that specific arena type (2, 3, or 5) otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check Team Size Before Adding Member
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team &&\
      \ team->GetMembersSize() < 5) {\n    // Add new member logic here\n    printf(\"\
      Team has %zu members, can still add more\\n\", team->GetMembersSize());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through Team Members Using Size
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nsize_t memberCount\
      \ = team->GetMembersSize();\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < memberCount; ++i) {\n  \
      \  ArenaTeamMember* member = team->GetMember(i);\n    if (member) {\n      \
      \  printf(\"Member %zu: %s\\n\", i, member->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant-time operation that simply returns a cached value
    representing the current number of members. It does not perform any database queries
    or computations. The arena team size is maintained internally by the system and
    updated whenever players join or leave the team.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned size may change at any time due to players
    joining or leaving the team, so calling this method in a loop without proper synchronization
    might lead to inconsistent results if the team state changes during execution.
