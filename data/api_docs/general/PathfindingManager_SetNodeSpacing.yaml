  class: PathfindingManager
  method: SetNodeSpacing
  signature: void PathfindingManager::SetNodeSpacing(float spacing)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spacing between nodes in the pathfinding grid for navigation calculations.
  description: The SetNodeSpacing method configures the distance between individual
    nodes used in the pathfinding system. This parameter directly affects how finely
    the navigation mesh is subdivided and influences both the accuracy of paths generated
    and the computational overhead required for pathfinding operations. A smaller
    spacing value results in more detailed pathfinding but increased processing time,
    while a larger spacing value reduces computational load at the cost of path precision.
    The method is typically called during initialization or configuration of the pathfinding
    manager to establish optimal trade-offs between performance and navigation accuracy.
  parameters:
  - name: spacing
    description: The distance in world units between adjacent nodes in the pathfinding
      grid. Must be a positive floating-point value greater than zero. Typical values
      range from 0.5 to 5.0 units depending on the game object's size and required
      navigation precision.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Node Spacing Configuration
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      manager->SetNodeSpacing(2.0f); // Configure medium granularity pathfinding'
    language: cpp
  - title: High Precision Pathfinding Setup
    code: 'PathfindingManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      manager->SetNodeSpacing(0.5f); // Configure high precision for detailed navigation'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any pathfinding operations are performed
    to ensure consistent behavior. Changing node spacing during active pathfinding
    may lead to inconsistent results or require rebuilding of internal data structures.
    The optimal spacing value depends on the specific requirements of the game object
    using the pathfinding system, typically balancing between performance and navigation
    fidelity.
  warnings: Setting the spacing too small can significantly increase memory usage
    and processing time for pathfinding calculations. Setting it too large may result
    in paths that are overly simplified and potentially invalid for complex environments
    or objects requiring precise movement. Avoid calling this method during active
    pathfinding operations as it may cause undefined behavior.
