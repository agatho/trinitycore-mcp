  method: GetTeamComposition
  signature: TeamComposition ArenaAI::GetTeamComposition(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the team composition for an arena match.
  description: The GetTeamComposition method returns a TeamComposition object that
    describes the current makeup of players in an arena match. This includes information
    about which faction each player belongs to, and how many players from each faction
    are present on the team. The method is typically used by AI systems to make strategic
    decisions during arena battles, such as determining optimal targeting or positioning
    strategies based on the opposing team's composition. It provides a snapshot of
    the current state of the arena match for tactical analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TeamComposition object that contains information about the faction distribution
    of players in the arena team. This object typically includes counts or lists of
    players from each faction (Alliance and Horde) to help determine strategic advantages
    or disadvantages during gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TeamComposition comp = arenaAI->GetTeamComposition();\nif (comp.allianceCount\
      \ > comp.hordeCount)\n{\n    // Prefer targeting Horde players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in arena AI logic and may not be directly accessible
    from player-facing code. The returned TeamComposition object should be treated
    as read-only for strategic decision-making purposes.
  warnings: The method assumes that the ArenaAI instance has been properly initialized
    with valid team data. Calling this method before a match begins or when no players
    are present may result in undefined behavior or incorrect composition data.
