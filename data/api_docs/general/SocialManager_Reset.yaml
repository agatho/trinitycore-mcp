  signature: void SocialManager::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the social manager's internal state and clears all stored social data
    for the associated player.
  description: The Reset method clears all social list entries, including friends,
    ignores, and blocked players, from the SocialManager instance. This operation
    typically occurs when a player logs out or when the social system needs to be
    reinitialized. The method ensures that any cached or temporary social data is
    cleared and that the manager returns to its default empty state. It does not affect
    the underlying database records but rather resets the in-memory representation
    of the social list for the current session.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'SocialManager* socialMgr = player->GetSocial();

      socialMgr->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system during logout
    or login transitions. It's important to note that resetting the social manager
    does not persist changes to the database; it only clears the in-memory state.
