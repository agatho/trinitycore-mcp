documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current session represents a bot character.
  description: The IsBot method checks if the session is associated with a bot character
    rather than a real player. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI and
    automation systems to differentiate between player-controlled and bot-controlled
    entities. The check typically involves verifying internal flags or character type
    indicators within the session context. This functionality is essential for implementing
    bot-specific logic, preventing certain actions for bots, or applying different
    game mechanics based on whether the entity is a real player or an automated bot.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the session represents a bot character; otherwise returns
    false if it represents a real player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Check
    code: "if (session->IsBot()) {\n    // Handle bot-specific logic\n    printf(\"\
      This is a bot session\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle real player logic\n  \
      \  printf(\"This is a player session\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bot Behavior
    code: "void ProcessSession(IBotSession* session) {\n    if (session->IsBot())\
      \ {\n        // Apply bot-specific AI behavior\n        session->ExecuteBotAI();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply normal player behavior\n        session->HandlePlayerInput();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal session flags or character properties
    that distinguish bots from players. It's important to note that the implementation
    may vary depending on how bots are registered and managed within the TrinityCore
    framework. The method should be called frequently in performance-critical sections
    as it typically performs a simple flag check.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not used in contexts where session state might
    be inconsistent or uninitialized, as this could lead to incorrect behavior. Also,
    be aware that some bot implementations may not immediately reflect their status
    through this method during initialization phases.
