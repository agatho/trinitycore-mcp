  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: IsExactSplinePath
  signature: bool WaypointMovementGenerator::IsExactSplinePath() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the waypoint movement generator uses an exact spline path
    for movement.
  description: The IsExactSplinePath method checks if the current waypoint movement
    generator is configured to use a precise spline-based path for mob or creature
    movement. This flag typically controls how waypoints are interpolated between
    positions, with exact spline paths providing smoother and more accurate movement
    trajectories compared to simpler linear interpolation. The method returns true
    when the movement generator employs splines for precise positioning along the
    defined path, which is often used in scripted AI behaviors or custom movement
    patterns within TrinityCore's creature AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the waypoint movement generator uses an exact spline path
    for movement interpolation; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Movement Uses Spline Path
    code: "WaypointMovementGenerator* movementGen = dynamic_cast<WaypointMovementGenerator*>(creature->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator());\n\
      if (movementGen && movementGen->IsExactSplinePath()) {\n    // Creature is using\
      \ spline-based path interpolation\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature is using exact\
      \ spline path.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with AI behavior scripting to
    determine movement precision. It may be influenced by creature flags, movement
    type settings, or specific script configurations within TrinityCore's AI framework.
