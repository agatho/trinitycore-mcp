  class: KitingManager
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void KitingManager::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 interval)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for the kiting manager's periodic updates.
  description: Configures the frequency at which the KitingManager performs its periodic
    checks and updates. This interval determines how often the manager evaluates the
    player's movement patterns and adjusts kiting behavior accordingly. The update
    interval is typically measured in milliseconds and affects the responsiveness
    and performance of the kiting system. Setting this value too low may impact performance,
    while setting it too high may reduce the effectiveness of kiting optimizations.
  parameters:
  - name: interval
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are positive integers
      representing time intervals. Lower values (e.g., 50-100ms) provide more responsive
      updates but may impact performance, while higher values (e.g., 200-500ms) reduce
      CPU usage but may cause less precise kiting behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a standard update interval
    code: 'KitingManager* kitingMgr = player->GetKitingManager();

      kitingMgr->SetUpdateInterval(100); // Update every 100 milliseconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing for performance with longer intervals
    code: 'KitingManager* kitingMgr = player->GetKitingManager();

      kitingMgr->SetUpdateInterval(300); // Update every 300 milliseconds for better
      performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the kiting manager's internal timer and should
    be called before starting any kiting operations. The interval value is stored
    internally and used by the manager's update loop to determine when to perform
    kiting calculations.
  warnings: Setting the interval to zero or very small values may cause excessive
    CPU usage and potential performance degradation. Ensure that the chosen interval
    aligns with the intended gameplay experience and system capabilities.
