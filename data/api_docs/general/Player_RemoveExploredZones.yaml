  method: RemoveExploredZones
  signature: void Player::RemoveExploredZones(uint32 pos, uint64 mask)
documentation:
  brief: Removes explored zones from a player's known zones list.
  description: This method removes explored zones from a player's known zones list
    by specifying a position and mask. It is used to clear specific zone exploration
    data that has been previously marked as explored. The method operates on the player's
    exploration data, allowing developers to manage which zones have been explored
    or not. This functionality is particularly useful for resetting exploration status
    in certain game scenarios, such as when a player needs to re-explore a zone after
    it has been cleared or when implementing custom exploration mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position in the explored zones array to remove from. This represents
      an index within the player's exploration data structure.
  - name: mask
    description: The mask value representing which zones to remove. This is typically
      a 64-bit value that specifies the zone IDs to clear from the player's exploration
      list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveExploredZones(0, 0x1);

      // Removes the first zone from explored zones list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's exploration management system and should
    be used carefully when modifying exploration data. It may affect game mechanics
    related to quest completion or zone exploration status.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect exploration tracking,
    potentially causing issues with quest completion or zone exploration status in-game.
