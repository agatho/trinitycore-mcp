  signature: float BotPerformanceMonitor::CalculateLoadPercent(uint32 tickTimeMicros)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current load percentage of the bot performance
    monitor based on the provided tick time.
  description: The CalculateLoadPercent method computes the load percentage by comparing
    the given tick time against a predefined threshold or baseline. This value represents
    how much system resources are being consumed during a specific monitoring interval,
    which is crucial for maintaining optimal performance in bot-controlled environments.
    The method is typically used to determine if the system is under heavy load and
    may require throttling or adjustment of bot activities. It's important to note
    that this calculation assumes consistent tick timing and accurate microsecond
    measurements for reliable results.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated load percentage. Values typically
    range from 0.0 (no load) to 100.0 (maximum load), though exact bounds depend on
    internal implementation details and thresholds used by the BotPerformanceMonitor.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Load Calculation
    code: 'uint32 tickTime = 5000; // 5 milliseconds

      float loadPercent = monitor.CalculateLoadPercent(tickTime);

      // Returns a float value indicating current system load percentage'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)\n{\n    uint32 startTick = getTickCount();\n\
      \    // Simulate some bot activity\n    processBotCommands();\n    uint32 endTick\
      \ = getTickCount();\n    float load = monitor.CalculateLoadPercent(endTick -\
      \ startTick);\n    if (load > 80.0f)\n        throttleBotActivity();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate timing measurements and assumes that tickTimeMicros
    represents the actual time elapsed during a single processing cycle. The implementation
    may use internal thresholds or historical averages to normalize the load calculation.
    Developers should ensure that timing functions used to generate tickTimeMicros
    provide microsecond-level precision for meaningful results.
  warnings: The method's accuracy depends heavily on precise timing measurements.
    Using inaccurate or coarse-grained timing sources can lead to misleading load
    percentages. Additionally, calling this method too frequently without proper throttling
    may introduce overhead that could skew performance monitoring itself.
