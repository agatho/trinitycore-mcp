  signature: BattlegroundStatus Battleground::GetStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current status of the battleground instance.
  description: The GetStatus method returns the current state of the battleground,
    indicating whether it is waiting to start, in progress, or has ended. This status
    is crucial for determining the phase of the battleground and affects how players
    interact with the environment, such as whether they can join, are in combat, or
    are in the cooldown period after a match ends. The returned BattlegroundStatus
    enum provides a standardized way to check the battleground's lifecycle state without
    needing to inspect multiple internal flags or timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BattlegroundStatus enum value representing the current state of the battleground.
    Possible values include BG_STATUS_WAIT_QUEUE, BG_STATUS_WAIT_JOIN, BG_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS,
    BG_STATUS_WAIT_LEAVE, and BG_STATUS_NONE depending on the battleground's lifecycle
    phase.
  examples:
  - title: Check if battleground is active
    code: "if (bg->GetStatus() == BG_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS)\n{\n    // Battleground is\
      \ currently active\n    // Allow player actions such as combat or objectives\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handle different battleground states
    code: "switch (bg->GetStatus())\n{\n    case BG_STATUS_WAIT_QUEUE:\n        //\
      \ Waiting for players to fill the queue\n        break;\n    case BG_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS:\n\
      \        // Battleground is active, handle game logic\n        break;\n    case\
      \ BG_STATUS_WAIT_LEAVE:\n        // Battleground ending, prepare for cleanup\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // No active battleground\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any context. It provides
    a quick way to determine the battleground state without needing to access internal
    member variables directly. The status value returned should be used immediately
    as it may change between calls if the battleground transitions states.
