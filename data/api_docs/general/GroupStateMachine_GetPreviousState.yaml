  method: GetPreviousState
  signature: GroupState GroupStateMachine::GetPreviousState() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the previous group state from the GroupStateMachine.
  description: The GetPreviousState method retrieves the last known group state that
    was stored within the GroupStateMachine. This is typically used to track state
    transitions in group management systems, such as when a player joins or leaves
    a group, or when a group's activity changes. The method does not modify any internal
    state and simply returns the previously recorded state value. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with state change tracking and debugging mechanisms within TrinityCore's
    group handling logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupState enum value representing the previous group state that was
    recorded in the state machine. The specific values depend on the GroupState enumeration
    defined in the codebase, which typically includes states like GROUP_STATE_NONE,
    GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE, GROUP_STATE_INACTIVE, etc.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve previous group state
    code: "GroupStateMachine stateMachine;\n// ... some state transitions occur ...\n\
      GroupState previousState = stateMachine.GetPreviousState();\nif (previousState\
      \ == GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE) {\n    // Handle transition from active to current\
      \ state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GroupStateMachine has previously recorded at
    least one state transition. If called immediately after initialization without
    any prior transitions, the behavior may depend on the default initial state value
    set in the implementation. The method is thread-safe if the underlying GroupStateMachine
    is designed to be thread-safe.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupStateMachine instance is properly initialized and
    has undergone at least one state transition before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected results. If used in a multi-threaded environment, verify that no concurrent
    modifications occur during the call.
