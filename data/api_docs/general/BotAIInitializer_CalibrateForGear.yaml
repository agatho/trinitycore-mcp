documentation:
  brief: Initializes bot AI behavior based on equipped gear and item statistics
  description: The CalibrateForGear method adjusts a bot's artificial intelligence
    parameters according to the gear currently equipped by the bot character. This
    calibration process evaluates item stats such as damage, armor, spell power, and
    other relevant attributes to modify the bot's decision-making patterns for combat,
    spell casting, and resource management. The method ensures that bots behave appropriately
    based on their gear loadout, making them more realistic and effective in different
    combat scenarios. This function is typically called during bot initialization
    or when gear changes occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.CalibrateForGear();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after a bot's gear has been set or modified
    to ensure accurate AI behavior. The calibration process may involve complex calculations
    based on item quality, enchantments, and stat combinations.
