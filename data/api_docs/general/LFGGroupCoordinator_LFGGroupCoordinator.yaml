documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LFGGroupCoordinator instance as a copy of an existing coordinator.
  description: The LFGGroupCoordinator constructor is used to create a new instance
    of the LFGGroupCoordinator class by copying the state and configuration from an
    existing coordinator object. This method is typically invoked when duplicating
    or cloning group coordination settings for different instances within the Looking
    For Group (LFG) system. The copied coordinator maintains all relevant group data,
    including player assignments, role requirements, and queued status. This constructor
    ensures proper initialization of internal structures required for managing LFG
    groups in TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator originalCoordinator;

      // ... configure originalCoordinator ...

      LFGGroupCoordinator newCoordinator(originalCoordinator); // Copy constructor
      usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, which means it performs a deep copy of the source
    object's data members. Developers should be aware that this operation may involve
    copying large amounts of group-related data and should consider performance implications
    when used frequently.
