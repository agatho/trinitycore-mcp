  signature: void LineOfSightManager::AddCacheEntry(const LoSCacheEntry & entry)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a line of sight cache entry to the manager's internal cache storage.
  description: The AddCacheEntry method is responsible for inserting a LoSCacheEntry
    object into the LineOfSightManager's internal caching system. This method allows
    the manager to store precomputed line of sight data, which can be used to optimize
    performance by avoiding redundant calculations. The cache entry typically contains
    information about the start and end points of a line of sight check, along with
    the result of that check. When this method is invoked, it stores the provided
    cache entry in an internal data structure, likely a hash map or similar container,
    for later retrieval during line of sight queries.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: A const reference to a LoSCacheEntry object that contains precomputed
      line of sight data including start/end positions and the result of the line
      of sight check.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Cache Entry
    code: 'LoSCacheEntry cacheEntry;

      cacheEntry.start = Position(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

      cacheEntry.end = Position(10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f);

      cacheEntry.isLineOfSight = true;

      lineOfSightManager.AddCacheEntry(cacheEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the LineOfSightManager to store
    computed line of sight results. It's important to note that the cache entries
    should be added only after a line of sight check has been performed, and they
    are usually added when the result is positive (i.e., there is line of sight).
    The internal storage mechanism may use a hash-based lookup for fast retrieval.
