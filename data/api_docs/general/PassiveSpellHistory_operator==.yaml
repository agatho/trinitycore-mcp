documentation:
  brief: Compares two PassiveSpellHistory objects for equality based on their internal
    spell data and cooldown states.
  description: The operator== method performs a deep comparison between two PassiveSpellHistory
    objects to determine if they are equivalent. This comparison typically evaluates
    whether both objects contain the same set of passive spells, their associated
    cooldown timers, and related state information. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method is crucial for maintaining consistency
    in spell tracking across different game entities such as players, NPCs, or pets.
    It ensures that passive abilities with identical configurations are treated uniformly
    during gameplay mechanics like spell cooldown management, aura application, or
    ability usage checks.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The PassiveSpellHistory object to compare against the current instance.
      This parameter represents another set of passive spell data that will be compared
      for equality with the calling object.
  returns: Returns true if both PassiveSpellHistory objects are identical in terms
    of their stored spell entries, cooldown states, and associated metadata; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Comparing Two PassiveSpellHistory Objects
    code: 'PassiveSpellHistory history1;

      PassiveSpellHistory history2;

      // Assume both objects are populated with same passive spells

      bool isEqual = (history1 == history2); // Returns true if contents match exactly'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Equality Check in Spell Cooldown Logic
    code: "if (player->GetSpellHistory() == npc->GetSpellHistory()) {\n    // Both\
      \ entities have same passive spell cooldown states\n    // Proceed with shared\
      \ logic or synchronization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal containers storing spell IDs, cooldown
    timestamps, and state flags. It's important to note that even minor differences
    in spell data or timing will result in a false comparison. The performance of
    this method depends on the number of passive spells stored within each object.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this operator with objects that may have different
    internal states due to asynchronous updates or race conditions. Ensure both objects
    are fully initialized before performing comparisons to avoid unexpected behavior.
