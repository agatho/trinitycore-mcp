  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadJumpChargeParams()
documentation:
  brief: Loads jump charge parameters from the database into memory for use in movement
    and combat mechanics.
  description: The LoadJumpChargeParams method initializes and loads jump charge configuration
    data from the game database into internal memory structures. This data is used
    by the movement system to determine how jump charges are applied during player
    or creature movement, particularly for abilities that require jump mechanics such
    as leap attacks or special movement abilities. The method typically executes during
    server startup or reload operations to ensure all jump-related parameters are
    properly initialized before gameplay begins. It reads configuration values from
    database tables related to jump mechanics and stores them in appropriate internal
    caches for fast access during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadJumpChargeParams();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and database loading
    phases. It's important to ensure that the underlying database tables containing
    jump charge parameters are properly populated before this method is invoked. The
    loaded data is cached in memory for performance reasons, so changes to the database
    will not be reflected until the method is called again.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that database connections are valid
    and that required tables exist before calling this method.
