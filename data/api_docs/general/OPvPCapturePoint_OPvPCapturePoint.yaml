  brief: Moves an OPvPCapturePoint object to another OPvPCapturePoint object using
    move semantics.
  description: The OPvPCapturePoint move constructor transfers ownership of resources
    from a source OPvPCapturePoint object to a destination OPvPCapturePoint object.
    This constructor is part of the C++ move semantics implementation and allows for
    efficient resource management when creating new objects from temporary or rvalue
    references. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    this method supports the dynamic creation and management of capture point objects
    used in outdoor PvP systems. The move constructor ensures that any internal data
    structures, such as pointers to game objects or state information, are properly
    transferred without unnecessary copying.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing an OPvPCapturePoint
    code: 'OPvPCapturePoint* source = new OPvPCapturePoint();

      OPvPCapturePoint movedPoint = std::move(*source);

      // ''source'' is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // ''movedPoint'' contains the resources previously owned by ''source'''
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor follows standard C++ move semantics. After the move, the
    source object should not be used for any operations that require its previous
    state. The implementation assumes that the moved-from object is left in a valid
    but unspecified state as per C++ standard requirements.
  warnings: Attempting to use the source object after a move operation results in
    undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the original object are invalidated
    immediately after calling this constructor.
