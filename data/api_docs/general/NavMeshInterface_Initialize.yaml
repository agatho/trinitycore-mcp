  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool NavMeshInterface::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the navigation mesh interface for pathfinding and movement calculations.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state of the NavMeshInterface
    class, preparing it for use in generating paths and performing movement-related
    operations. This typically involves loading or constructing the navigation mesh
    data, initializing internal buffers, and setting up necessary resources for pathfinding
    algorithms. The method should be called once during system initialization or when
    the navigation mesh needs to be rebuilt. It is essential that this method completes
    successfully before any other navigation-related methods are invoked.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all required resources
    were properly allocated; returns false if initialization failed due to missing
    data, resource constraints, or other initialization errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Check
    code: "NavMeshInterface navMesh;\nif (navMesh.Initialize()) {\n    // Navigation\
      \ mesh is ready for use\n    printf(\"Navigation mesh initialized successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to\
      \ initialize navigation mesh\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive as it typically loads large
    amounts of navigation data from disk or generates the mesh from terrain information.
    It should not be called frequently during runtime. The method is usually invoked
    once at server startup or when a new map is loaded.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    resource leaks. Ensure that any previous initialization state is properly cleaned
    up before calling Initialize again.
