  class: WarriorAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool WarriorAI::HasEnoughResource(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the warrior has sufficient resource (rage, energy, or combo points)
    to cast a specified spell
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the WarriorAI instance
    has adequate resource allocation to execute a given spell. This method is crucial
    for AI decision-making in combat scenarios, ensuring that spells are only attempted
    when the warrior possesses sufficient rage, energy, or combo points as required
    by the spell's resource cost. The method considers the current resource state
    of the AI-controlled warrior and compares it against the resource requirements
    of the specified spell. It plays a vital role in preventing failed spell casts
    due to insufficient resources, thereby optimizing combat efficiency for the AI-controlled
    warrior.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to entries in the Spell.dbc database file and determines
      the specific resource cost associated with casting that spell.
  returns: Returns true if the warrior has sufficient resources to cast the specified
    spell, false otherwise. The method accounts for all resource types including rage,
    energy, and combo points based on the spell's requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (warriorAI->HasEnoughResource(7386)) {\n    // Execute Hamstring if\
      \ enough rage\n    warriorAI->DoCastVictim(7386);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 1680;\nif (warriorAI->HasEnoughResource(spellToCast))\
      \ {\n    warriorAI->DoCastVictim(spellToCast);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative\
      \ ability or wait\n    warriorAI->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the warrior's resource management system
    and should be called before attempting to cast any spell that requires specific
    resources. The implementation likely checks against the current rage, energy,
    or combo point values stored in the AI's internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell entry in
    the database, as invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect resource
    calculations. This method does not account for temporary resource modifiers or
    buffs that might affect the actual casting requirements.
