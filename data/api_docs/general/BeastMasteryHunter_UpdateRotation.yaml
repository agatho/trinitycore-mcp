  class: BeastMasteryHunter
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunter::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the hunter's beast mastery rotation based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate abilities and actions for a Beast Mastery hunter class based on
    the current target. This method evaluates various combat conditions, resource
    levels, and cooldown states to decide which spells or abilities should be cast
    next in order to maximize damage output or efficiency. It typically involves checking
    if the hunter has sufficient focus, whether abilities are off cooldown, and if
    the target is within appropriate range for the selected abilities. The method
    may also consider pet behavior and positioning when making rotation decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current combat target.
      This parameter defines the target against which the hunter will evaluate and
      execute rotation logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunter::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Logic to determine next\
      \ ability based on current state and target\n    // Implementation would involve\
      \ checking focus, cooldowns, and target conditions\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle in combat situations.
    Developers should ensure that the target parameter is valid and alive before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target pointer can lead to crashes or unexpected
    behavior. Always validate that the target exists and is alive before invoking
    this method.
