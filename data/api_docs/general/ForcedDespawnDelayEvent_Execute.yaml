  class: ForcedDespawnDelayEvent
  method: Execute
  signature: bool ForcedDespawnDelayEvent::Execute(uint64 e_time, uint32 p_time)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the forced despawn delay event, handling cleanup and removal of
    objects after a specified time period.
  description: The Execute method is responsible for performing the core logic of
    a ForcedDespawnDelayEvent, which typically occurs when an object (such as a creature
    or game object) needs to be removed from the world after a predetermined delay.
    This method is invoked by the event system and manages the actual despawn process,
    including updating internal state and ensuring proper cleanup. It is commonly
    used in scenarios where temporary objects need to be automatically destroyed after
    a certain duration, such as summoned creatures or temporary game objects. The
    method returns true if the event was successfully processed and false if it failed
    or was already handled.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the event was successfully executed and the object was
    properly despawned; returns false if the event could not be completed or was already
    processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event System
    code: "ForcedDespawnDelayEvent* event = new ForcedDespawnDelayEvent();\nbool result\
      \ = event->Execute(1000, 500);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Despawn completed successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Object despawned successfully.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Despawn failed or already processed\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to despawn\
      \ object.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore event system.
    Developers should not manually invoke this method unless implementing custom event
    handling logic. The event system manages timing and execution automatically based
    on provided time parameters.
  warnings: Improper use of this method or direct invocation without proper context
    may lead to undefined behavior, including memory leaks or object state corruption.
    Ensure that objects are properly initialized before attempting any despawn operations.
