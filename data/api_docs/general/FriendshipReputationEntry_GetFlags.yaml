  class: FriendshipReputationEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int FriendshipReputationEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a friendship reputation entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags that define various properties or states of a friendship reputation entry.
    These flags typically control how the friendship relationship behaves within the
    game, such as whether it's active, locked, or has special permissions. The returned
    value is a combination of bit flags that can be checked using bitwise operations
    to determine specific characteristics of the friendship reputation.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask flags for the friendship reputation
    entry. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag that defines
    properties of the friendship, such as active state, locked status, or special
    permissions. The exact meaning of each bit must be determined by referencing the
    game's flag definitions or documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if friendship is active
    code: "FriendshipReputationEntry* entry = sFriendshipMgr->GetFriendshipReputationEntry(playerGuid,\
      \ friendGuid);\nif (entry && (entry->GetFlags() & FRIENDSHIP_FLAG_ACTIVE))\n\
      {\n    // Friendship is currently active\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining multiple flag checks
    code: "FriendshipReputationEntry* entry = sFriendshipMgr->GetFriendshipReputationEntry(playerGuid,\
      \ friendGuid);\nint flags = entry ? entry->GetFlags() : 0;\nif (flags & FRIENDSHIP_FLAG_ACTIVE\
      \ && !(flags & FRIENDSHIP_FLAG_LOCKED))\n{\n    // Friendship is active and\
      \ not locked\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact bit positions and meanings of the flags are implementation-specific
    and should be referenced from TrinityCore's friendship reputation flag definitions.
    This method is typically used in conjunction with other friendship-related methods
    to manage and query friendship states within the game world.
