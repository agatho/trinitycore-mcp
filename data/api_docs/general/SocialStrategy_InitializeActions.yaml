documentation:
  brief: Initializes the social behavior actions for the player's AI.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up and configures all social interaction
    behaviors for a player's AI within the TrinityCore framework. This includes establishing
    default social responses, action priorities, and behavior states that govern how
    the AI interacts with other players or NPCs in the game world. The method is typically
    called during AI initialization or when the social strategy is activated. It prepares
    the internal action queue and ensures all required social behaviors are properly
    registered and ready for execution.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SocialStrategy strategy;

      strategy.InitializeActions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's initialization phase.
    Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or duplicate action registrations.
    The method does not perform any runtime checks for existing actions, so it's important
    to ensure proper sequencing of initialization steps.
