documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Demon Hunter has enough fury to perform an action
  description: The HasFury method determines whether the Demon Hunter AI character
    possesses a specified amount of fury. This is a critical game mechanic in World
    of Warcraft's Demon Hunter class, where fury is the resource used for casting
    abilities and executing special attacks. The method evaluates the current fury
    level against the required amount and returns true if sufficient fury is available,
    otherwise false. This check is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to
    determine when a Demon Hunter can safely use powerful abilities without running
    out of resources.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The minimum amount of fury required for the check. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the fury cost of an ability or action.
  returns: Returns true if the Demon Hunter currently has at least the specified amount
    of fury; returns false otherwise. The method does not account for temporary fury
    changes during the current game tick.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (ai->HasFury(30)) {\n    // Execute a high-cost ability\n    ai->DoAction(ACTION_EXECUTE_FURY_ABILITY);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Casting
    code: "if (ai->HasFury(50) && !ai->IsCasting()) {\n    // Cast a powerful ability\
      \ that costs 50 fury\n    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_FURY_BLAST);\n} else if (ai->HasFury(20))\
      \ {\n    // Cast a cheaper ability\n    ai->CastSpell(SPELL_FURY_STRIKE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly queries the current fury value from the AI's internal
    state and should be used in conjunction with other resource management checks
    for optimal gameplay behavior. The method does not modify or consume fury; it
    only performs a read-only check.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in rapid succession without proper
    cooldown handling, as it may lead to inconsistent behavior if fury values change
    between checks. Always verify that the required fury amount is available before
    attempting to consume resources.
