documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and shutdown operations for the trade manager system
  description: The OnShutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating all
    active trade operations and cleaning up associated resources within the TradeManager
    subsystem. This method ensures that any pending trades are properly handled, active
    trade sessions are closed, and all trade-related data structures are safely destroyed
    before the server shuts down or the module is unloaded. The method typically gets
    invoked during server shutdown sequences or when the trade system needs to be
    temporarily disabled.

    code: TradeManager::OnShutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown or module unloading
    sequences. Calling it during active gameplay may result in loss of trade data
    and unexpected behavior for players involved in ongoing trades.
  warnings: Do not invoke this method while players have active trades in progress,
    as it may lead to corrupted trade data or player disconnects. This method is typically
    called internally by the server's shutdown sequence.
