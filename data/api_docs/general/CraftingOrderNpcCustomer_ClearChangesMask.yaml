documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the crafting order NPC customer, resetting its
    update state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a CraftingOrderNpcCustomer instance. This is typically used during the update
    cycle to indicate that all previously marked changes have been processed and should
    no longer be considered as pending updates. The method ensures that subsequent
    calls to update or synchronization routines will not include data from prior change
    notifications, effectively clearing the dirty state of the object. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this is commonly invoked during
    the handling of player interactions with crafting NPCs to maintain accurate state
    tracking and prevent redundant updates.

    code: 'CraftingOrderNpcCustomer* customer = ...;

      customer->ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core update loop of the
    NPC system. It's important to understand that clearing the changes mask does not
    reset the actual data values, but only the tracking mechanism used to determine
    which fields have changed since the last update cycle.
