  class: MonkAI
  method: ExecuteMistweaverRotation
  signature: void MonkAI::ExecuteMistweaverRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Mistweaver monk's combat rotation logic.
  description: The ExecuteMistweaverRotation method implements the core decision-making
    logic for a Mistweaver monk AI during combat. It evaluates the current state of
    the target and the player's resources to determine the optimal ability to cast
    next. This includes managing healing over time effects, prioritizing key abilities
    like Renewing Mist and Essence Font, and handling resource conservation. The method
    integrates with the broader AI system to ensure that the monk follows a balanced
    and efficient healing rotation while maintaining optimal resource usage.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index in the
      combat system. This parameter is used to identify which unit the AI should focus
      its healing efforts on.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyMonkAI::Update()\n{\n    int targetId = GetTargetId();\n    ExecuteMistweaverRotation(&targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void MistweaverAI::ExecuteMistweaverRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target <= 0) return;\n    \n    // Core rotation logic\n    if (HasResourceForEssenceFont())\n\
      \        CastEssenceFont();\n    else if (ShouldCastRenewingMist())\n      \
      \  CastRenewingMist();\n    else\n        CastHeal();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the AI has access to necessary resource tracking
    and target state information. The implementation may vary based on the specific
    version of TrinityCore and the current game mechanics for Mistweaver monks.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid targets can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect rotation decisions.
