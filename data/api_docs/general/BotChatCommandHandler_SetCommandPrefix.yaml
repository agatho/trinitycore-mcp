  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: SetCommandPrefix
  signature: void BotChatCommandHandler::SetCommandPrefix(std::string prefix)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the command prefix used by the bot chat command handler to identify
    and process chat commands.
  description: The SetCommandPrefix method configures the string prefix that the BotChatCommandHandler
    uses to determine when a chat message should be treated as a command. This prefix
    is typically a character or sequence of characters (such as '/' or '!') that distinguishes
    bot commands from regular chat messages. When a chat message begins with this
    prefix, the handler will attempt to parse and execute the corresponding bot command.
    The method does not validate the input prefix, so it's up to the caller to ensure
    the prefix is appropriate for the intended use case. This setting affects all
    subsequent command processing by the handler instance.
  parameters:
  - name: prefix
    description: The string prefix to be used for identifying bot commands in chat
      messages. This should typically be a single character or short sequence of characters
      that does not conflict with normal chat text.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a standard slash prefix
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.SetCommandPrefix("/");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a custom exclamation mark prefix
    code: 'BotChatCommandHandler handler;

      handler.SetCommandPrefix("!");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the BotChatCommandHandler
    instance. It is recommended to set the command prefix early in the bot's initialization
    process before any chat messages are processed. The prefix is stored as a std::string
    and copied during assignment, so performance impact is minimal.
  warnings: Setting an empty string as the prefix may cause unexpected behavior or
    make all chat messages appear to be commands. Ensure that the prefix is a valid,
    non-empty string that does not conflict with normal chat content or other system
    prefixes.
