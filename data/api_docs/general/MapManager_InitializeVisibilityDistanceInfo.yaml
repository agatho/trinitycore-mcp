  method: InitializeVisibilityDistanceInfo
  signature: void MapManager::InitializeVisibilityDistanceInfo()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes visibility distance information for all maps in the map manager.
  description: The InitializeVisibilityDistanceInfo method sets up and configures
    visibility distance parameters for all maps managed by the MapManager. This includes
    initializing default visibility ranges, loading configuration settings from the
    server's configuration files, and preparing internal data structures needed for
    determining which objects and players are visible to each other within different
    map instances. The method is typically called during server startup or map initialization
    phases to ensure that all maps have proper visibility settings before gameplay
    begins. It ensures that the visibility system operates correctly across all map
    types and dimensions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeMaps()\n{\n    sMapMgr->InitializeVisibilityDistanceInfo();\n\
      \    // Other map initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or duplicate data structures. The visibility
    distance settings are typically loaded from configuration files such as worldserver.conf,
    and this method reads those values to set up the internal map visibility systems.
  warnings: Do not call this method after maps have already been populated with players
    or objects, as it may cause inconsistencies in the visibility system. This method
    is part of the internal initialization process and should not be called directly
    by game logic modules.
