  method: IsEventValid
  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::IsEventValid(SmartScriptHolder & e)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a SmartScriptHolder event is properly configured and ready
    for use in the AI system.
  description: The IsEventValid method checks if a given SmartScriptHolder object
    contains valid configuration data for a smart AI event. It ensures that all required
    fields are properly set, event types are supported, and no conflicting or invalid
    parameters exist. This validation is crucial before executing or scheduling AI
    events to prevent runtime errors and ensure proper behavior in the TrinityCore
    AI system. The method performs checks on event type, target conditions, action
    parameters, and other internal state variables to determine if the event can be
    safely processed by the SmartAI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object containing the AI event configuration
      to validate. This structure holds all the data needed for a single smart AI
      event including event type, parameters, and associated actions.
  returns: Returns true if the SmartScriptHolder event is valid and can be safely
    processed by the SmartAI system, false otherwise. Invalid events typically include
    those with missing required fields, unsupported event types, or conflicting parameter
    combinations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Validation
    code: "SmartScriptHolder event;\n// Configure event...\nif (sSmartAIMgr->IsEventValid(event))\
      \ {\n    // Event is valid, can proceed with execution\n    sSmartAIMgr->AddEvent(event);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid event configuration\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"smartai\"\
      , \"Invalid smart AI event detected and rejected\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in AI Script Processing
    code: "void ProcessSmartScript(SmartScriptHolder& script) {\n    if (!sSmartAIMgr->IsEventValid(script))\
      \ {\n        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"smartai\", \"Skipping invalid event in script: %u\"\
      , script.GetId());\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with valid\
      \ event processing\n    sSmartAIMgr->ExecuteEvent(script);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called internally by the SmartAI system during event registration
    and execution. It performs comprehensive validation but may have performance implications
    when validating large numbers of events simultaneously. The validation includes
    checking for valid target types, ensuring action parameters are within acceptable
    ranges, and verifying that event conditions make logical sense.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly constructed SmartScriptHolder
    can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure the SmartScriptHolder is properly
    initialized before calling IsEventValid. This method does not modify the input
    parameter, but it may change internal state during validation.
