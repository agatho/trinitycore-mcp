  method: ExecuteObjective
  signature: void QuestCompletion::ExecuteObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a quest objective for the specified player bot.
  description: The ExecuteObjective method processes and completes a given quest objective
    for a player bot within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked
    during quest progression when an objective needs to be fulfilled, such as killing
    a specific number of mobs or collecting items. It handles the internal logic required
    to update quest states, award rewards, and manage related game mechanics. The
    method ensures that all necessary conditions for completing the objective are
    met before proceeding with the execution.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is executing
      the quest objective. Must not be null.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing the details
      and state of the objective to be executed. This includes information about what
      needs to be completed and current progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Objective Execution
    code: 'Player* playerBot = ...; // Assume valid bot

      QuestObjectiveData questObj;

      questObj.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_KILL;

      questObj.targetEntry = 12345;

      questObj.requiredCount = 10;

      questObj.currentCount = 0;

      QuestCompletion completion;

      completion.ExecuteObjective(playerBot, questObj);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest completion system and should only
    be called during appropriate quest update cycles. It assumes that the objective
    data has been properly initialized with valid values before execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the QuestObjectiveData
    structure may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required
    fields are populated before invoking this method.
