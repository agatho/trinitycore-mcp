documentation:
  brief: Converts an Object to a Corpse instance.
  description: The ToCorpse method is used to transform an Object into a Corpse instance,
    typically when an object (such as a player or creature) dies and becomes a corpse.
    This method allows access to the corpse data associated with the object, enabling
    further processing of corpse-related information such as corpse GUIDs, faction,
    and other properties. The method is commonly used in game mechanics involving
    death and resurrection, particularly in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Corpse instance associated with the object. If
    the object is not a corpse or has no associated corpse data, this may return nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const Corpse* corpse = obj->ToCorpse();\nif (corpse)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ corpse data\n    uint32_t guid = corpse->GetGUID();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with death-related game mechanics,
    and should be handled carefully when dealing with objects that may not yet have
    been converted to corpses. Performance considerations include checking for null
    pointers before accessing corpse data.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it can lead to memory access
    violations if the object is not a valid corpse or has not been properly initialized.
    Also, this method should only be used in contexts where the object is known to
    have died and become a corpse.
