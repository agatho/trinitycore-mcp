  class: Creature
  method: LoadEquipment
  signature: void Creature::LoadEquipment(int8 id, bool force)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the equipment for a creature based on the specified equipment ID.
  description: The LoadEquipment method initializes and applies the equipment configuration
    for a Creature instance. It retrieves the appropriate equipment data from the
    database using the provided ID and sets up the creature's inventory with the corresponding
    items. This method is typically invoked during creature creation or when switching
    equipment sets. The force parameter allows overriding existing equipment if needed,
    which can be useful in scenarios such as boss encounters where specific gear needs
    to be enforced regardless of current state.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The identifier for the equipment set to load. This corresponds to
      an entry in the creature_equip_template table in the database.
  - name: force
    description: If true, forces the loading of equipment even if the creature already
      has equipment assigned. If false, skips loading if equipment is already present.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equipment Loading
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->LoadEquipment(1, false); // Load default equipment set 1 without forcing'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Equipment Update
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->LoadEquipment(2, true); // Force load equipment set 2, overriding
      current gear'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the database to fetch equipment templates. It
    should be called after the creature has been initialized but before it is fully
    spawned in the world. The equipment IDs must exist in the creature_equip_template
    table, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Calling this method on a creature that is already in combat or actively
    moving may cause unexpected behavior or visual glitches. Additionally, forcing
    equipment changes during active gameplay can disrupt player expectations and game
    balance if not handled carefully.
