  signature: void SpatialGridManager::~SpatialGridManager()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SpatialGridManager instance and releases all associated memory
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpatialGridManager class is responsible for
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the spatial
    grid system. This includes freeing memory for grid cells, removing references
    to objects within those grids, and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the manager
    is destroyed. The destructor is automatically invoked when a SpatialGridManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It plays a critical role in
    maintaining memory efficiency and preventing resource leaks in the TrinityCore
    server's spatial indexing system.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SpatialGridManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SpatialGridManager gridManager;\n    // ...\
      \ use gridManager ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when gridManager\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of SpatialGridManager
    code: 'SpatialGridManager* gridManager = new SpatialGridManager();

      // ... use gridManager ...

      delete gridManager; // Triggers destructor

      gridManager = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are essential for memory
    management. It is important to ensure that no other objects hold references to
    the manager during destruction, as this could lead to dangling pointers or undefined
    behavior. The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly on stack-allocated instances; it will
    be automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope. Avoid calling the
    destructor on objects that are still referenced elsewhere, as this can lead to
    memory corruption or crashes.
