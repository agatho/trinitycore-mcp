  class: CombatStateAnalyzer
  method: GetHistory
  signature: const std::array<MetricsSnapshot, 10> & CombatStateAnalyzer::GetHistory()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the historical combat metrics snapshot data for the last ten combat
    events.
  description: The GetHistory method provides access to a fixed-size array containing
    the most recent combat state snapshots. Each snapshot represents a point-in-time
    measurement of combat-related metrics, such as damage dealt, healing done, and
    resource usage. This data is typically used for performance analysis, combat log
    evaluation, or real-time combat statistics tracking within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned array is always of size 10, with the most recent entry at index 0
    and older entries following sequentially. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe to call multiple times without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a std::array containing exactly 10 MetricsSnapshot
    objects, representing the latest combat history. Each element corresponds to a
    specific combat event in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat History for Analysis
    code: "#include <CombatStateAnalyzer.h>\n\nvoid AnalyzeRecentCombat(const CombatStateAnalyzer&\
      \ analyzer) {\n    const auto& history = analyzer.GetHistory();\n    for (size_t\
      \ i = 0; i < history.size(); ++i) {\n        const auto& snapshot = history[i];\n\
      \        // Process each snapshot for combat analysis\n        std::cout <<\
      \ \"Combat event \" << i << \": \" << snapshot.GetDamageDealt() << \" damage\\\
      n\";\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is a constant reference, meaning modifications to the
    contents are not allowed through this interface. The underlying data structure
    maintains a circular buffer of snapshots internally, ensuring that only the most
    recent 10 combat events are retained. This method is optimized for frequent calls
    and does not perform any expensive operations.
