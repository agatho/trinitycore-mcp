  class: DependencyValidator
  method: TestPhmapPerformance
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::TestPhmapPerformance()
documentation:
  brief: Tests the performance of the phmap container implementation used by the dependency
    validator.
  description: The TestPhmapPerformance method evaluates the efficiency and responsiveness
    of the phmap (parallel hash map) data structure utilized within the DependencyValidator
    class. This test typically measures insertion, lookup, and deletion operations
    under various load conditions to ensure optimal performance for dependency resolution
    tasks. The method is designed to validate that the underlying container implementation
    meets performance requirements for real-time game systems where fast dependency
    checks are essential. It may be invoked during system initialization or performance
    testing phases to verify that hash map operations maintain acceptable latency
    thresholds.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all performance tests pass within acceptable time thresholds,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates potential performance bottlenecks
    in the phmap implementation that may require optimization or alternative data
    structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Test Execution
    code: "if (DependencyValidator::TestPhmapPerformance()) {\n    // Performance\
      \ is acceptable\n    LOG_INFO(\"performance\", \"phmap performance test passed\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Performance issues detected\n    LOG_ERROR(\"performance\"\
      , \"phmap performance test failed - potential bottleneck\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant computational overhead during execution
    and should typically be run in development or testing environments rather than
    production. The test results are dependent on system resources and may vary between
    different hardware configurations. Consider running this test multiple times to
    account for system variability.
  warnings: Do not call this method frequently in performance-critical code paths
    as it performs intensive operations that could impact game frame rate. The test
    may temporarily consume high CPU resources during execution.
