  method: GetDuplicateRate
  signature: double MovementArbiterStatistics::GetDuplicateRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the rate of duplicate movement packets processed by
    the movement arbiter.
  description: The GetDuplicateRate method computes the ratio of duplicate movement
    packets to the total number of movement packets processed by the MovementArbiterStatistics
    instance. This metric is used to monitor network efficiency and potential packet
    duplication issues in the TrinityCore server's movement handling system. The value
    represents a double-precision floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where
    0.0 indicates no duplicates and 1.0 indicates all packets are duplicates. This
    method is typically called during performance monitoring or debugging sessions
    to assess network stability and client-server communication quality.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the duplicate rate as a ratio between 0.0 (no
    duplicates) and 1.0 (all packets are duplicates). Returns 0.0 if no movement packets
    have been processed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Network Health
    code: "MovementArbiterStatistics stats;\n// ... process movement data ...\ndouble\
      \ duplicateRate = stats.GetDuplicateRate();\nif (duplicateRate > 0.1) {\n  \
      \  // Log high duplicate rate warning\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"High duplicate rate detected: %.2f%%\", duplicateRate * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a calculation based on internal counters maintained
    by the MovementArbiterStatistics class. The accuracy of the returned value depends
    on proper initialization and updating of these counters during movement packet
    processing. The method is thread-safe as it only reads from immutable state variables.
  warnings: The duplicate rate may not accurately reflect actual network conditions
    if the statistics are reset or not properly maintained between different sessions
    or server restarts. Always ensure that movement packet tracking is enabled in
    the server configuration for meaningful results.
