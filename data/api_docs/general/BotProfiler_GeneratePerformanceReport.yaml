  class: BotProfiler
  method: GeneratePerformanceReport
  signature: bool BotProfiler::GeneratePerformanceReport(uint64_t sessionId, std::string
    & report)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance report for a specified bot session.
  description: The GeneratePerformanceReport method creates a detailed performance
    analysis report for a given bot session identified by its session ID. This method
    is typically used in TrinityCore's bot system to evaluate and log the efficiency
    of AI behaviors, resource usage, and overall performance metrics during bot operations.
    The generated report includes timing data, memory consumption, and other relevant
    statistics that help developers optimize bot behavior and identify potential bottlenecks.
    The method requires a valid session ID to be provided, and will return false if
    the session does not exist or is invalid.
  parameters:
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the bot session to generate report for. Must
      correspond to an active session in the system.
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a string where the generated performance report will
      be stored. The string is populated with formatted report data upon successful
      execution.
  returns: True if the performance report was successfully generated for the specified
    session, false otherwise. Returns false when the session ID is invalid or the
    session does not exist.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint64_t sessionId = 12345;\nstd::string report;\nif (botProfiler->GeneratePerformanceReport(sessionId,\
      \ report)) {\n    std::cout << \"Report generated: \" << report << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Failed to generate report for session \" << sessionId\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling
    code: "uint64_t invalidSessionId = 0;\nstd::string report;\nbool success = botProfiler->GeneratePerformanceReport(invalidSessionId,\
      \ report);\nif (!success) {\n    std::cout << \"No report generated - invalid\
      \ session ID\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's bot profiling system and should only
    be called when bot performance monitoring is enabled. The report format may vary
    based on the current profiling configuration settings. Ensure that the session
    ID provided corresponds to an active bot session, otherwise the method will fail
    silently or return false.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent session ID will result
    in a failed operation and false return value. Do not assume that all session IDs
    are valid - always validate before calling. The report string may contain sensitive
    performance data that should be handled appropriately.
