  class: Battlefield
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool Battlefield::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the battlefield instance is currently enabled and active.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if a Battlefield object is currently
    active and functional within the game world. This status indicates whether the
    battlefield has been initialized, is accepting players, and is running its core
    gameplay mechanics. The method typically returns true when the battlefield is
    operational and false when it is disabled or in a shutdown state. This check is
    essential for determining valid states before performing operations such as player
    registration, zone transitions, or combat-related actions within the battlefield.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battlefield is currently enabled and active, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the battlefield is
    either not initialized, in a disabled state, or undergoing maintenance or shutdown
    procedures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Battlefield Status
    code: "if (battlefield->IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with battlefield operations\n\
      \    battlefield->AddPlayer(player);\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled battlefield\
      \ case\n    player->SendNotification(\"Battlefield is currently disabled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsEnabled in Player Entry Logic
    code: "void Player::HandleBattlefieldEntry(Battlefield* bf) {\n    if (bf && bf->IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n        // Allow player to enter battlefield\n        bf->PlayerEnter(player);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Prevent entry and notify player\n        SendSystemMessage(\"\
      This battlefield is not currently available.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The IsEnabled method is typically used as a quick status check before performing
    any operations on the battlefield. It's important to note that even if a battlefield
    is enabled, additional checks might be required for specific operations like player
    capacity limits or zone restrictions. This method is generally thread-safe and
    should not cause performance issues when called frequently.
  warnings: Do not assume that a battlefield being enabled means it's ready for immediate
    player interaction. Additional validation may be needed for player capacity, world
    state, or other conditions before allowing players to join. Calling methods on
    a disabled battlefield can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
