documentation:
  brief: Compares machine learning models of two bots and returns their similarity
    metrics.
  description: The CompareModels method evaluates and quantifies the similarity between
    the machine learning models of two specified bots within the TrinityCore framework.
    This functionality is typically used in AI-driven gameplay analysis or bot behavior
    comparison systems. The method takes two bot GUIDs as input parameters, retrieves
    their respective model data, performs a comparative analysis, and returns a structured
    result containing similarity scores and related metrics. It assumes both bots
    are active and have trained models available for comparison.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuidA
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the first bot to compare. Must correspond
      to an existing active bot in the system.
  - name: botGuidB
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the second bot to compare. Must correspond
      to an existing active bot in the system.
  returns: A ModelComparison object containing detailed metrics such as similarity
    score, confidence level, and other comparative data between the two models. Returns
    an empty or default-initialized structure if either bot GUID is invalid or no
    model data is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Model Comparison
    code: "ModelComparison result = analytics.CompareModels(12345, 67890);\nif (result.SimilarityScore\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    std::cout << \"Models are highly similar\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Invalid Bot GUIDs
    code: "ModelComparison result = analytics.CompareModels(99999, 88888);\nif (result.SimilarityScore\
      \ == -1.0f) {\n    std::cerr << \"One or both bot GUIDs are invalid\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve significant computational overhead depending on model
    complexity and data size. It is recommended to cache results when comparing the
    same bots multiple times. The method requires that both bots have completed their
    training phases and have valid model states stored in memory.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent bot GUIDs may lead to
    undefined behavior or exceptions. Ensure that the bots are active and their models
    are fully initialized before invoking this function. Performance degradation can
    occur if comparing many pairs of bots simultaneously.
