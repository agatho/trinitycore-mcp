  class: GroupCoordination
  method: SetPrimaryTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordination::SetPrimaryTarget(int targetGuid, uint32 priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the primary target for group coordination with specified GUID and priority.
  description: The SetPrimaryTarget method assigns a target GUID to the group coordination
    system with a given priority level. This method is typically used in group-based
    AI systems where multiple entities need to coordinate their actions around a common
    target. The priority value determines the importance of this target relative to
    other potential targets within the group's coordination logic. When called, the
    method updates the internal state of the GroupCoordination object to reflect the
    new primary target and its associated priority.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity to be set as the
      primary target. This should be a valid GUID that corresponds to an existing
      game object or unit in the world.
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level assigned to this target, determining its importance
      in group coordination decisions. Higher values indicate higher priority, with
      0 being the lowest priority level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.SetPrimaryTarget(12345, 100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Target with Different Priority
    code: 'GroupCoordination coord;

      coord.SetPrimaryTarget(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), 500);

      // Sets the player as primary target with high priority'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the GroupCoordination object.
    It is recommended to validate that the targetGuid corresponds to an existing entity
    before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior. The priority parameter
    should be carefully chosen based on game logic requirements.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid targetGuid may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes if not properly validated. Ensure that the target exists in the world
    before setting it as primary target.
