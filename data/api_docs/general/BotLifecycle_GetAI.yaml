  method: GetAI
  signature: BotAI * BotLifecycle::GetAI() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the BotAI instance associated with the bot lifecycle.
  description: The GetAI method returns a pointer to the BotAI object that manages
    the artificial intelligence behavior for a specific bot. This method is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to access and interact with the AI subsystem
    of bot characters. The returned BotAI pointer allows developers to query or modify
    bot behaviors, decision-making processes, and AI-related states. The method is
    designed to be called on valid bot lifecycle objects where an AI instance has
    been properly initialized. It's important to note that the returned pointer may
    be null if the AI system hasn't been initialized for this particular bot lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotAI object managing this bot's AI behavior, or nullptr
    if no AI instance is associated with this bot lifecycle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotAI* ai = botLifecycle->GetAI();\nif (ai != nullptr) {\n    // Use the\
      \ AI object\n    ai->UpdateAI();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Access with Null Check
    code: "BotAI* ai = botLifecycle->GetAI();\nif (ai && ai->IsAlive()) {\n    //\
      \ Perform AI-related operations\n    ai->MoveToTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot management system in TrinityCore and assumes
    that the BotLifecycle object has been properly initialized with an associated
    AI component. The returned BotAI pointer should be used carefully as it may become
    invalid if the bot lifecycle is destroyed or reinitialized.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before using the BotAI pointer to
    avoid segmentation faults. Accessing AI methods on a null pointer will result
    in undefined behavior and likely crash the server.
