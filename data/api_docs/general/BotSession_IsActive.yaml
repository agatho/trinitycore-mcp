  signature: bool BotSession::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session is currently active and operational.
  description: The IsActive method determines if a BotSession object is in an active
    state, meaning it has been properly initialized and is ready to process commands
    or maintain its bot behavior within the game world. This method typically checks
    internal flags or states that indicate whether the session is running, connected,
    and functional. It's commonly used by the TrinityCore AI system to verify that
    a bot session is valid before attempting to interact with it or perform actions
    on behalf of a player character.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session is active and operational; otherwise returns
    false if the session is inactive, uninitialized, or has been terminated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check session status
    code: "if (botSession->IsActive()) {\n    // Proceed with bot operations\n   \
      \ botSession->Update();\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive session\n    LogError(\"\
      Bot session is not active\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive in a loop to monitor bot state
    code: "while (true) {\n    if (!botSession->IsActive()) {\n        LogWarning(\"\
      Bot session became inactive, restarting...\");\n        botSession->Restart();\n\
      \    }\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a lightweight check that examines
    internal state flags rather than performing expensive operations. It's safe to
    call from multiple threads, but the underlying session state may change between
    calls if other threads are modifying it.
  warnings: Do not assume that a session remains active after calling IsActive().
    The session state can change at any time due to external factors such as player
    logout, server shutdown, or manual termination of the bot. Always validate session
    status before performing operations that could cause undefined behavior.
