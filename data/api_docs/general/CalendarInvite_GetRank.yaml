  class: CalendarInvite
  method: GetRank
  signature: CalendarModerationRank CalendarInvite::GetRank() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the moderation rank of the calendar invite.
  description: The GetRank method returns the CalendarModerationRank associated with
    this calendar invite. This rank determines the level of permissions and privileges
    the invitee has within the calendar event, such as whether they can modify event
    details or manage attendees. The returned rank is typically used by the server
    to enforce access control and determine what actions a player can perform on a
    calendar event. This method does not require any parameters and always returns
    a valid CalendarModerationRank value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CalendarModerationRank enum value representing the moderation level of
    this calendar invite. Possible values typically include ranks like GUEST, ATTENDEE,
    MODERATOR, and OWNER, which define different levels of access and permissions
    for the calendar event.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Check Invite Rank
    code: "CalendarInvite* invite = ...; // Assume invite is valid\nCalendarModerationRank\
      \ rank = invite->GetRank();\nif (rank == CalendarModerationRank::MODERATOR ||\
      \ rank == CalendarModerationRank::OWNER)\n{\n    // Allow event modification\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify any internal state.
    It's designed to be called frequently during calendar operations, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The returned rank value directly
    corresponds to the player's role in the event context.
