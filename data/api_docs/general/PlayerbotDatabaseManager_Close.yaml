  method: Close
  signature: void PlayerbotDatabaseManager::Close()
documentation:
  brief: Closes the playerbot database connection and releases associated resources.
  description: The Close method terminates the active connection to the playerbot
    database, ensuring that all pending transactions are committed or rolled back
    and that system resources are properly released. This method is typically invoked
    during shutdown sequences or when switching database contexts. It ensures that
    no further operations can be performed on the database until a new connection
    is established via the appropriate initialization methods. The method does not
    take any parameters and performs no return value operations, making it a straightforward
    cleanup function within the PlayerbotDatabaseManager class.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Shutdown
    code: "void ShutdownPlayerbots()\n{\n    PlayerbotDatabaseManager::instance()->Close();\n\
      \    // Further shutdown logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the database connection is no longer
    needed. Repeated calls to Close without reinitializing the connection may result
    in undefined behavior. It's recommended to ensure all active playerbot sessions
    are properly terminated before calling this function.
