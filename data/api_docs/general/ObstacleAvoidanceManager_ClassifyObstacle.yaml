  signature: ObstacleType ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ClassifyObstacle(WorldObject *
    object)
documentation:
  brief: Classifies a WorldObject as an obstacle type for AI pathfinding and avoidance.
  description: The ClassifyObstacle method determines the type of obstacle represented
    by a given WorldObject, which is essential for the AI's obstacle avoidance system
    in TrinityCore. This classification helps the AI understand how to navigate around
    different types of objects such as creatures, game objects, or environmental features.
    The method evaluates properties of the object to assign it to one of several predefined
    obstacle categories that influence pathfinding decisions. It serves as a core
    component in dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance logic for NPC movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ObstacleType enumeration value indicating the classified type
    of the obstacle. Possible values include OBSTACLE_TYPE_NONE, OBSTACLE_TYPE_CREATURE,
    OBSTACLE_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, OBSTACLE_TYPE_ENVIRONMENTAL, etc., depending on how
    the object is categorized for avoidance purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle classification
    code: "ObstacleType type = obstacleManager->ClassifyObstacle(targetObject);\n\
      if (type != OBSTACLE_TYPE_NONE)\n{\n    // Handle obstacle avoidance logic\n\
      \    switch (type)\n    {\n        case OBSTACLE_TYPE_CREATURE:\n          \
      \  // Avoid creature-specific behavior\n            break;\n        case OBSTACLE_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT:\n\
      \            // Handle game object avoidance\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI pathfinding calculations to dynamically
    assess the environment. The classification may depend on object flags, display
    IDs, or other properties that determine how the AI should treat the obstacle.
    Performance is important as this method may be called frequently during movement
    calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldObject pointer passed is valid and not null before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The method assumes proper initialization
    of object data structures and may return unexpected classifications if object
    state is inconsistent.
