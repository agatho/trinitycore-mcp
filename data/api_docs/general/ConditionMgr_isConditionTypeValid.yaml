  signature: bool ConditionMgr::isConditionTypeValid(Condition * cond) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a condition's type is supported by the ConditionMgr system.
  description: The isConditionTypeValid method checks if the condition type specified
    in the provided Condition object is recognized and supported by the ConditionMgr.
    This validation ensures that only valid condition types are processed within the
    TrinityCore system, preventing errors during conditional evaluation. The method
    typically performs a lookup against an internal registry or enumeration of supported
    condition types to determine validity. It is commonly used before processing conditions
    to avoid runtime failures due to invalid condition types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the condition type is valid and supported by ConditionMgr,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation of a condition
    code: "Condition* cond = new Condition();\ncond->m_conditionType = CONDITION_AURA;\n\
      bool isValid = sConditionMgr->isConditionTypeValid(cond);\nif (isValid)\n{\n\
      \    // Process the condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during condition initialization or validation
    phases. It's important to note that this check only validates the condition type
    itself, not the validity of the condition's parameters or values.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null Condition pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the Condition object is properly
    initialized before calling this method.
