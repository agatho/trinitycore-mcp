documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique type identifier for the battleground instance
  description: The GetTypeID method retrieves the unique integer identifier that represents
    the specific type of battleground this instance belongs to. This identifier is
    used internally by TrinityCore to distinguish between different battleground templates
    and manage their respective game mechanics, scoring systems, and reward structures.
    The returned value corresponds to predefined battleground type constants defined
    in the game's configuration and database. This method is commonly used for identifying
    battlegrounds in event handling, player matching systems, and reward distribution
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique type identifier of the battleground.
    This value maps to specific battleground templates defined in the game's database
    and configuration files, such as 1 for Alterac Valley, 2 for Warsong Gulch, etc.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground();\nint bgTypeId = bg->GetTypeID();\n\
      switch (bgTypeId)\n{\n    case BATTLEGROUND_AV:\n        // Handle Alterac Valley\
      \ logic\n        break;\n    case BATTLEGROUND_WS:\n        // Handle Warsong\
      \ Gulch logic\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Specific Battleground Type
    code: "Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground();\nif (bg && bg->GetTypeID()\
      \ == BATTLEGROUND_AV)\n{\n    // Player is in Alterac Valley\n    // Execute\
      \ AV-specific code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the battleground
    object's state. The type ID returned is determined at battleground creation time
    and remains constant throughout the battleground's lifetime. This identifier is
    crucial for maintaining game balance and ensuring proper handling of different
    battleground mechanics.
