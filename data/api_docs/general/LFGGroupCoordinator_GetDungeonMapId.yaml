  signature: uint32 LFGGroupCoordinator::GetDungeonMapId(uint32 dungeonId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map identifier associated with a specified dungeon ID for LFG
    group coordination.
  description: The GetDungeonMapId method is used within the LFG (Looking For Group)
    system to retrieve the corresponding map identifier for a given dungeon ID. This
    mapping is essential for coordinating group activities, such as determining which
    instance or zone a player should be directed to when joining a specific dungeon.
    The method serves as a lookup utility that translates dungeon identifiers into
    their respective map IDs, enabling proper instance management and player routing
    within the game's LFG framework. It is typically called during group creation
    or dungeon selection processes to ensure players are sent to the correct locations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the map identifier (uint32) associated with the specified dungeon
    ID. If the dungeon ID does not correspond to a valid map, the method may return
    zero or an undefined value depending on internal implementation and validation
    checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 mapId = lfgGroupCoordinator->GetDungeonMapId(1234);\nif (mapId !=\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with group assignment to the specified map\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player assigned to map ID: %u\", mapId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG coordination system and relies on
    pre-defined mappings between dungeon IDs and their corresponding maps. It should
    only be called after verifying that the dungeon ID is valid within the context
    of active LFG operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the dungeonId parameter is validated before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior or invalid map assignments. The method may return
    zero for invalid dungeon IDs, which could lead to incorrect instance handling
    if not properly checked.
