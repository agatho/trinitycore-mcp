api:
  class: BotSessionManager
  method: UnregisterBotAI
  signature: void BotSessionManager::UnregisterBotAI(WorldSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Unregisters a bot AI associated with the specified WorldSession.
  description: The UnregisterBotAI method removes the association between a bot AI
    instance and a specific WorldSession. This typically occurs when a bot session
    ends or is terminated, ensuring that the AI system no longer tracks or manages
    that particular session. The method likely updates internal data structures to
    remove references to the bot AI, preventing further interaction with the session.
    It's an essential part of the bot management lifecycle within TrinityCore's AI
    framework.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the session to unregister
      from the bot AI system. Must be a valid session pointer; passing null may result
      in undefined behavior.
  returns: None. This method performs an operation and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotSessionManager::instance()->UnregisterBotAI(playerSession);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system and may be called
    automatically during session cleanup or manual bot termination. It's important
    to ensure that the session pointer passed is valid before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null session pointer can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the session exists and is active before unregistering
    its AI.
