documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given group contains any bot players.
  description: The GroupHasBots method determines if a specified World of Warcraft
    group includes any player bots. This utility function is commonly used in bot-related
    systems to differentiate between player-controlled and bot-controlled groups,
    particularly in automated gameplay scenarios or when applying specific logic based
    on group composition. The method iterates through all members of the provided
    group and evaluates each member to determine if they are a bot character. It returns
    true if at least one bot is found in the group, otherwise false.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified group contains one or more bot players; returns
    false if the group consists entirely of real player characters or is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Group Composition
    code: "if (PlayerBotHooks::GroupHasBots(playerGroup)) {\n    // Handle logic specific\
      \ to groups containing bots\n    sLog->outString(\"Group contains bot players.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle logic for groups with only real players\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Group contains only real players.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that bot detection is handled through the player's IsBot()
    or similar flag-checking mechanism. It may not account for custom bot implementations
    or edge cases where bot status isn't immediately detectable. Performance impact
    is minimal as it only checks group membership and does not perform complex operations.
