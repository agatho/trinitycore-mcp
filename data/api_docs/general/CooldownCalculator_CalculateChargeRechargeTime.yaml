  class: CooldownCalculator
  method: CalculateChargeRechargeTime
  signature: uint32 CooldownCalculator::CalculateChargeRechargeTime(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the recharge time for spell charges based on the spell's cooldown
    properties.
  description: The CalculateChargeRechargeTime method determines how long it takes
    for a spell's charge to regenerate after being used. This is particularly relevant
    for abilities that have limited charges and a cooldown period between recharges.
    The method retrieves the necessary spell data from the game's internal databases,
    evaluates the spell's charge recharge mechanics, and returns the time in milliseconds
    required for one charge to be restored. It considers factors such as the spell's
    base cooldown, any modifiers, and the player's relevant attributes that may affect
    recharge rates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time in milliseconds needed to
    recharge one charge of the specified spell. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    either no charges or an invalid spell ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 rechargeTime = cooldownCalculator.CalculateChargeRechargeTime(12345);\n\
      if (rechargeTime > 0)\n{\n    // Use the recharge time to update UI or game\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Spell recharge time: %u ms\\n\", rechargeTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal TrinityCore spell data structures. Ensure
    that the spell ID provided is valid and corresponds to a spell with charge mechanics.
    The calculation may be affected by player buffs, debuffs, or other game state
    modifiers that influence cooldown reduction.
  warnings: Passing an invalid spell ID may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    calculations. Always validate spell IDs before calling this method if the source
    is untrusted. Be cautious when using this in performance-critical code paths as
    it may involve database lookups or complex calculations.
