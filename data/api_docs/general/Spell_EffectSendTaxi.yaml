  brief: Executes the taxi travel effect for a spell, enabling player to travel via
    flight paths.
  description: The EffectSendTaxi method is responsible for handling the execution
    of taxi-related spell effects within TrinityCore. This method facilitates the
    player's movement through flight paths, typically used in conjunction with spell
    effects that allow character to travel via air routes. It generally involves sending
    the player to a specific destination using the taxi system, and may be triggered
    by various spells such as those related to flight paths or transportation. The
    method is part of the broader spell handling mechanism and operates within the
    context of World of Warcraft's flight path system.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell execution and requires proper
    initialization of the spell's target and flight path data. It may involve interaction
    with the player's movement system, and should be called only when appropriate
    flight path data is available.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect player movement
    or failed flight path execution. Ensure that the spell's target is properly set
    before calling this method.
