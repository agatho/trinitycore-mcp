  method: DoAction
  signature: void SmartAI::DoAction(int32 param)
documentation:
  brief: Triggers a specific action within the SmartAI system based on the provided
    parameter identifier.
  description: The DoAction method is used to execute a predefined action within the
    SmartAI framework. It takes an integer parameter that identifies which action
    to perform, allowing for dynamic behavior changes during NPC AI execution. This
    method is typically invoked by other AI events or conditions to initiate specific
    behaviors such as starting movement, casting spells, or changing states. The parameter
    value corresponds to predefined action IDs defined in the SmartAI configuration
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: param
    description: An integer identifier that specifies which action to execute within
      the SmartAI system. This value maps to a predefined action ID in the AI configuration,
      determining the specific behavior to be triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Trigger
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Trigger action with ID 1 when\
      \ entering combat\n    DoAction(1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Action Execution
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetHealthPct() < 30)\n    {\n\
      \        // Trigger healing action when health drops below 30%\n        DoAction(5);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the context of the SmartAI system and should
    only be called from within AI event handlers or update functions. The parameter
    value must correspond to a valid action ID defined in the creature's SmartAI configuration,
    otherwise the action will not execute correctly.
  warnings: Calling DoAction with an invalid parameter value may result in undefined
    behavior or no action being executed. Ensure that all action IDs used are properly
    configured in the database before calling this method.
