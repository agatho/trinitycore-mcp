documentation:
  brief: Optimizes item placement within the guild bank by reorganizing items to maximize
    space efficiency and accessibility.
  description: The OptimizeItemPlacement method in GuildBankManager is responsible
    for reorganizing items stored in a guild's bank vault to improve inventory management.
    This function typically attempts to consolidate similar items, fill gaps in the
    bank slots, and ensure that frequently accessed items are placed in easily reachable
    locations. The optimization process may involve moving items between different
    slots within the guild bank, potentially affecting the order and positioning of
    items for all guild members. It is commonly invoked when guild members perform
    actions such as depositing or withdrawing items, or when administrators manually
    trigger a reorganization to maintain optimal storage layout.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player ID who initiated the
      optimization request. This parameter may be used internally to determine permissions
      or track which member triggered the operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager* bankManager = sObjectAccessor->GetGuildBankManager();

      bankManager->OptimizeItemPlacement(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs operations on the guild bank's internal data
    structures and may involve database updates. It is recommended to call this function
    sparingly to avoid unnecessary performance overhead during frequent item transactions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method or incorrect handling of the player ID parameter
    could lead to inconsistent state in the guild bank or unexpected behavior for
    other guild members accessing the vault.
