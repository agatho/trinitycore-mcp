  signature: uint8 Player::GetItemLimitCategoryQuantity(const ItemLimitCategoryEntry
    * limitEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quantity of items in a specific limit category for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the quantity of items that belong to a specific
    limit category for the current player. It is used to determine how many items
    of a particular type are available in the player's inventory or bank, based on
    the item limit category defined by the ItemLimitCategoryEntry. The method helps
    enforce game mechanics related to item restrictions and ensures proper handling
    of item quantity limits within the game system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the quantity of items in the specified
    limit category. This value indicates how many items are available for the player
    based on the limit category, with possible values ranging from 0 to 255.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 quantity = player->GetItemLimitCategoryQuantity(itemLimitCategoryEntry);\n\
      if (quantity > 0)\n{\n    // Process the item quantity\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Player class and operates on a const object, meaning
    it does not modify the player's state. It relies on internal player data structures
    to determine item quantities, making performance considerations important when
    used in frequent loops or checks.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no items are found in the specified limit
    category, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about item availability. Care
    should be taken when using this method for game logic that depends on item quantity.
