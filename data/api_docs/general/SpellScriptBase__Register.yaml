  brief: Registers a spell script with the spell system to enable custom spell behavior.
  description: The _Register method is responsible for registering a SpellScriptBase-derived
    class with the TrinityCore spell system. This method ensures that the custom spell
    logic defined in the derived class is properly linked to the corresponding spell
    entry and will be executed during spell casting or application. It typically initializes
    internal data structures, sets up event handlers, and prepares the script for
    execution within the game's spell processing pipeline. The registration process
    is crucial for any custom spell behavior to take effect in World of Warcraft.

  - title: Basic Spell Script Registration
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void _Register()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Register the spell script with the spell system\n\
      \        SpellScriptBase::_Register();\n        // Additional custom registration\
      \ logic can go here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a spell script is instantiated. Developers should not normally call this method
    directly unless implementing custom spell script registration logic. The method
    should be overridden in derived classes to provide custom behavior.
