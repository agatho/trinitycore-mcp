documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of accessory GUIDs associated with a vehicle
  description: The GetVehicleAccessoryList method retrieves a const integer array
    containing the GUIDs of all accessories attached to the specified vehicle. This
    method is used internally by the TrinityCore server to manage vehicle passenger
    assignments and accessory configurations. The returned pointer points to an internal
    data structure that should not be modified directly. The method assumes the provided
    Vehicle pointer is valid and properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const int pointer to an array of GUID values representing accessories
    attached to the vehicle, or nullptr if no accessories are found or the vehicle
    is invalid
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Vehicle* myVehicle = sObjectMgr->GetVehicle(12345);\nconst int* accessoryList\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetVehicleAccessoryList(myVehicle);\nif (accessoryList != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VEHICLE_ACCESSORIES && accessoryList[i] != 0;\
      \ ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Accessory GUID: %d\\n\", accessoryList[i]);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by the ObjectMgr and may be invalidated
    if vehicle data changes. The array is terminated with a zero value to indicate
    end-of-list. This method does not perform any validation on the Vehicle pointer
    beyond checking for null.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned array directly as it points to internal memory.
    Accessing beyond the valid array bounds can cause memory corruption. Ensure that
    the Vehicle parameter is valid before calling this method.
