  signature: int ZoneScript::GetGuidData(uint32 param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a GUID-based data value associated with a specific zone script
    parameter.
  description: The GetGuidData method is used within ZoneScript implementations to
    retrieve stored GUID-related data values. This method typically serves as part
    of the zone's scripting system, allowing scripts to access and manage unique identifiers
    or data tied to specific entities or events within a zone. It is commonly used
    in scripted encounters or quest systems where GUIDs are needed for tracking player
    interactions, object states, or event progressions. The method signature suggests
    it takes a uint32 parameter that likely represents an identifier for the data
    being retrieved, though the actual implementation may vary depending on how the
    ZoneScript is defined.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A uint32 parameter used as an identifier to specify which GUID-based
      data value should be retrieved. The exact meaning of this value depends on the
      specific ZoneScript implementation and may correspond to a type, index, or key
      for accessing stored data.
  returns: Returns an int value representing the requested GUID-based data. The return
    value could be a GUID itself, a reference to a GUID stored in the script's internal
    state, or a derived value based on GUID processing logic. A negative value or
    zero may indicate an invalid or unassigned identifier.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerGUID = zoneScript->GetGuidData(PLAYER_GUID_KEY);\nif (playerGUID\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process the retrieved GUID\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"scripts\", \"\
      Retrieved player GUID: %d\", playerGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Encounter Script
    code: "class MyZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    int GetGuidData(uint32\
      \ param0) const override\n    {\n        switch (param0)\n        {\n      \
      \      case BOSS_GUID_KEY:\n                return bossGUID;\n            case\
      \ DOOR_GUID_KEY:\n                return doorGUID;\n            default:\n \
      \               return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    int bossGUID =\
      \ 0;\n    int doorGUID = 0;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ZoneScript API and should only be called from
    within a valid ZoneScript context. The parameter value (param0) must correspond
    to a known key or index defined in the script's implementation. Improper use of
    this method may result in invalid data retrieval or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the param0 value passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an expected identifier within the ZoneScript. Passing unexpected values might
    lead to incorrect results or crashes if not properly handled by the underlying
    implementation.
