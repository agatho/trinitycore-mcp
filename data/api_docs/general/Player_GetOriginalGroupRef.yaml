  method: GetOriginalGroupRef
  signature: int & Player::GetOriginalGroupRef()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the original group reference identifier for the player.
  description: The GetOriginalGroupRef method retrieves the unique identifier that
    represents the original group or raid reference for a player in the TrinityCore
    framework. This value is typically used to track group membership and can be essential
    for maintaining proper game mechanics related to player grouping, instance management,
    and guild operations. The method returns an integer reference that corresponds
    to the group's ID or reference number, which may differ from the current group
    membership if the player has been moved between groups.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents the original group reference identifier as
    an integer reference. This value typically corresponds to the group ID or reference
    number that was assigned when the player first joined a group or raid, and can
    be used for tracking purposes in game mechanics such as instance management, guild
    operations, or group membership changes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int originalGroupRef = player->GetOriginalGroupRef();\nint currentGroupRef\
      \ = player->GetGroupRef();\n// Compare original vs current group reference\n\
      if (originalGroupRef != currentGroupRef) {\n    // Player has been moved between\
      \ groups\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other group-related methods
    like GetGroupRef() or GetGroup(). It's important to note that the original group
    reference may differ from the current group reference if the player has been moved
    between groups during gameplay. This method should be used carefully when tracking
    group membership changes.
  warnings: This method is not intended for direct use in most game mechanics but
    rather serves as a reference point for tracking group membership. Care should
    be taken to avoid confusion between original and current group references, especially
    when dealing with group transfers or instance management.
