documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new kiting target object for managing AI-based kiting behavior
    in combat.
  description: The KitingTarget constructor initializes a new instance of the KitingTarget
    class, which is used to manage and control kiting behavior for AI-controlled units
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. This class handles the logic for
    maintaining optimal distance from targets during combat, particularly useful for
    ranged attackers or casters that need to avoid melee engagement while keeping
    their target within spell range. The initialization process sets up internal state
    variables required for tracking target position, movement patterns, and kiting
    calculations. This constructor typically gets called when an AI unit needs to
    establish a new kiting target relationship.

  - title: Basic KitingTarget Initialization
    code: "class MyAIUnit : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeKiting()\n\
      \    {\n        KitingTarget kitingTarget;\n        // kitingTarget is now initialized\
      \ and ready for use\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It primarily sets up default values for internal state tracking. The
    actual kiting behavior logic is typically implemented in separate methods rather
    than the constructor itself.
