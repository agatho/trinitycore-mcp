documentation:
  brief: Returns the first invisible model associated with the creature template.
  description: The GetFirstInvisibleModel method retrieves the initial invisible model
    entry for a creature template. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, creatures can
    have multiple models defined in their template, including invisible ones used
    for specific visual effects or gameplay mechanics such as stealth, invisibility
    spells, or special animations. This method specifically returns the first model
    in the list that is marked as invisible, which may be useful for determining how
    a creature should appear under certain conditions or for implementing custom behavior
    related to invisible states. The returned pointer is const, indicating it should
    not be modified directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a CreatureModel object representing the first invisible
    model defined in the creature template. Returns nullptr if no invisible models
    are found in the template.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Invisible Model
    code: "const CreatureTemplate* creatureTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplate(12345);\n\
      const CreatureModel* invisibleModel = creatureTemplate->GetFirstInvisibleModel();\n\
      if (invisibleModel != nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle case where an invisible model\
      \ exists\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature has invisible model with ID: %u\",\
      \ invisibleModel->modelid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No invisible model found\n \
      \   sLog->outString(\"No invisible model found for creature.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CreatureTemplate has already been initialized
    with valid model data. The returned CreatureModel pointer should not be modified
    directly as it is part of a shared resource pool managed by the core. Performance-wise,
    this lookup is typically fast since it only returns the first match from an internal
    list.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer; since it's const, modifying
    through it will result in compile-time errors. Also, ensure that the CreatureTemplate
    object itself is valid before calling this method to prevent potential crashes
    or undefined behavior.
