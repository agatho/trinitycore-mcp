  class: WarlockAI
  method: HasEnoughMana
  signature: bool WarlockAI::HasEnoughMana(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the warlock has enough mana to cast a spell with the specified
    mana cost.
  description: The HasEnoughMana method evaluates whether the current warlock AI unit
    possesses sufficient mana to execute a spell or ability requiring a specific amount
    of mana. This method is typically used during AI decision-making processes to
    determine spell casting viability. The check considers the unit's current mana
    pool against the provided mana requirement, returning true if the mana is sufficient
    and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for proper warlock AI behavior,
    ensuring that spells are only cast when the unit can afford the associated mana
    cost.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The required mana amount needed to cast the spell or ability. Must
      be a non-negative integer representing the mana cost in game units.
  returns: Returns true if the warlock has at least the specified amount of mana available;
    returns false if the mana is insufficient.
  examples:
  - title: Basic mana check before casting
    code: "if (warlockAI->HasEnoughMana(50)) {\n    // Cast a spell that costs 50\
      \ mana\n    warlockAI->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHADOW_BOLT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional AI logic
    code: "if (warlockAI->HasEnoughMana(spellInfo->ManaCost)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ spell casting\n    warlockAI->DoCastVictim(spellInfo->Id);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Switch to alternative action like life drain or movement\n    warlockAI->DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the unit is a valid warlock AI and that mana values are
    properly initialized. It does not account for mana regeneration effects or temporary
    mana bonuses that might be active during spell casting. The method performs a
    direct comparison against current mana, so it should be used in contexts where
    immediate mana availability is required.
  warnings: Do not use this method to check for mana requirements without verifying
    that the unit is indeed a warlock AI. Using this method with invalid or uninitialized
    mana values may lead to incorrect behavior. Also, be aware that this method does
    not consider global cooldowns or other spell restrictions beyond mana availability.
