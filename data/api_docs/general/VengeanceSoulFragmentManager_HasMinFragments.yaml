  signature: bool VengeanceSoulFragmentManager::HasMinFragments(uint32 min) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has reached the minimum required fragments for vengeance
    soul fragmentation.
  description: The HasMinFragments method determines whether the current player possesses
    at least the specified minimum number of fragments required to perform a vengeance
    soul fragmentation action. This method is typically used in the context of World
    of Warcraft's Vengeance system, where players must accumulate a certain quantity
    of soul fragments before being able to initiate specific abilities or transformations.
    The check ensures that game mechanics are properly enforced and prevents invalid
    operations when fragment requirements are not met. This method does not modify
    any state; it only performs a read-only validation.
  parameters:
  - name: min
    description: The minimum number of fragments required to pass the check. Must
      be a non-negative integer representing the threshold value.
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least 'min' fragments, otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check fragment requirement
    code: "if (vengeanceSoulFragmentManager->HasMinFragments(5)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can proceed with vengeance soul fragmentation\n    DoVengeanceFragmentation();\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough fragments\n    SendErrorMessage(\"Not enough fragments.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic for ability activation
    code: "uint32 requiredFragments = 10;\nif (player->GetVengeanceSoulFragmentManager()->HasMinFragments(requiredFragments))\
      \ {\n    player->CastSpell(player, VENGEANCE_FRAGMENT_SPELL_ID, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You need more soul fragments to use this\
      \ ability.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that fragment counts are managed internally by the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager
    class. It is recommended to call this method before attempting any fragment-consuming
    operations to prevent unexpected behavior or errors in gameplay logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'min' parameter value is valid and non-negative; passing
    negative values may lead to undefined behavior depending on internal implementation
    details of the class.
