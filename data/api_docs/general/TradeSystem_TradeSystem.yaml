  signature: void TradeSystem::TradeSystem()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the TradeSystem class for handling player trading
    operations within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The TradeSystem constructor initializes all necessary internal state
    and data structures required for managing trade operations between players in
    World of Warcraft. This includes setting up trade session tracking, initializing
    trade item validation logic, and preparing the system to handle trade requests,
    confirmations, and finalization. The method ensures that the trade system is properly
    configured before any trading activities can occur. It performs no direct gameplay
    actions but prepares the infrastructure needed for trade mechanics to function
    correctly within the TrinityCore server environment.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new TradeSystem instance
    code: 'TradeSystem* tradeSystem = new TradeSystem();

      // The trade system is now initialized and ready to handle trades'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore server
    framework when initializing trading capabilities. Developers should not normally
    instantiate TradeSystem objects directly unless implementing custom trading logic.
    The system relies on proper server initialization sequences to function correctly.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of TradeSystem should be avoided in most cases as
    it's designed to be managed by the core TrinityCore systems. Improper use may
    lead to undefined behavior or trade system malfunctions.
