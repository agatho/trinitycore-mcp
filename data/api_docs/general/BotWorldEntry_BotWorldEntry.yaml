  class: BotWorldEntry
  method: BotWorldEntry
  signature: void BotWorldEntry::BotWorldEntry(std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session,
    int characterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new bot world entry with the specified session and character
    GUID.
  description: The BotWorldEntry constructor initializes a new instance of the BotWorldEntry
    class, associating it with a specific bot session and character identifier. This
    method sets up the necessary internal state for managing a bot's presence in the
    game world, including linking the bot to its session for communication and tracking
    its unique character GUID. The initialization process typically occurs when a
    bot is created or loaded into the game environment. This constructor is part of
    the TrinityCore bot system implementation and is essential for proper bot functionality
    within the World of Warcraft emulation framework.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that represents the active
      session for this bot. This parameter provides access to session-specific data,
      communication channels, and control mechanisms.
  - name: characterGuid
    description: An integer representing the unique global identifier (GUID) of the
      bot's character within the game world. This GUID is used to uniquely identify
      the bot character across all game systems and databases.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotWorldEntry Initialization
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(playerGuid);

      int botGuid = 12345;

      BotWorldEntry entry(session, botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Bot Entry with Dynamic Session
    code: 'uint64 playerGuid = 98765;

      std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>(playerGuid);

      int characterGuid = sObjectMgr->GetNextBotGuid();

      BotWorldEntry entry(session, characterGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the bot management system
    when creating new bot instances. The session parameter should be valid and not
    null to ensure proper bot functionality. The characterGuid must be unique within
    the game world to prevent conflicts with other characters or bots.
  warnings: Passing a null shared_ptr for session will likely cause runtime errors
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the characterGuid is properly validated and
    unique before initialization to avoid potential issues with character management
    in the game world.
