  class: Channel
  method: GetPlayerFlags
  signature: uint8 Channel::GetPlayerFlags(const int & guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the channel permissions flags for a specific player within the
    channel.
  description: The GetPlayerFlags method returns the permission level or role flags
    assigned to a particular player in the channel. These flags determine what actions
    the player can perform, such as speaking, inviting others, or moderating the channel.
    The method takes a player's GUID as input and looks up their associated permissions
    within the channel context. This is commonly used for managing channel membership
    and access control in World of Warcraft's communication system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose flags are being
      retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the channel.
  returns: A uint8 value representing the permission flags for the specified player.
    Each bit in the byte corresponds to a specific channel privilege, such as voice,
    moderator, or owner status.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Player Flags
    code: "uint8 flags = channel->GetPlayerFlags(playerGuid);\nif (flags & CHANNEL_FLAG_VOICE)\n\
      {\n    // Player has voice permission\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the channel system to enforce
    permissions. It assumes that the player GUID corresponds to an active member of
    the channel. The returned flags are usually bitwise combinations of predefined
    CHANNEL_FLAG_* constants.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID actually refers to a player currently in
    the channel, otherwise the result may be undefined or invalid. This method should
    not be called on non-existent players.
