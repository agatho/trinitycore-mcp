documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes creature quest ender data from the database for use
    in quest completion handling.
  description: The LoadCreatureQuestEnders method is responsible for loading all creature
    quest ender entries from the database into memory. These entries define which
    creatures can serve as quest enders, meaning they are involved in completing specific
    quests. The method typically runs during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that quest-related creature interactions are properly initialized. It
    processes data related to quest dependencies and creature involvement in quest
    completion mechanics, allowing the game to correctly track when a player has completed
    a quest by interacting with a specific creature.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    sObjectMgr->LoadCreatureQuestEnders();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the ObjectMgr initialization process.
    It's important to note that this method may be invoked multiple times during server
    runtime if database reloads occur, though it should handle duplicate entries gracefully.
    The data loaded by this method affects quest completion logic and should be synchronized
    with related quest data.
  warnings: Improper loading of creature quest ender data can result in quests not
    completing correctly or players being unable to finish certain quest objectives
    involving specific creatures. Ensure that the database tables containing quest
    ender information are properly maintained and consistent with other quest-related
    data.
