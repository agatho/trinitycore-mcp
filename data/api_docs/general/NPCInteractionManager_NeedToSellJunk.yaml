  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::NeedToSellJunk() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's inventory contains items that should be sold
    to an NPC.
  description: "The NeedToSellJunk method evaluates the current state of the player's\
    \ inventory to determine if there are any junk items\u2014typically low-value\
    \ or useless items\u2014that would benefit from being sold to an NPC vendor. This\
    \ check is commonly used in NPC interaction logic to decide whether to present\
    \ a 'sell junk' option or skip it entirely. The method does not modify the inventory\
    \ directly but rather provides a boolean flag indicating the presence of sellable\
    \ junk items. It is typically invoked during dialogue or interaction events with\
    \ vendors to optimize user experience by only showing relevant options."
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's inventory contains at least one junk item
    that can be sold; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "if (player->GetNPCInteractionManager()->NeedToSellJunk()) {\n    // Show\
      \ sell junk option to player\n    player->SendNPCDialogMessage(npc, \"Would\
      \ you like me to buy your junk?\");\n} else {\n    // No junk items found\n\
      \    player->SendNPCDialogMessage(npc, \"You don't have any junk to sell.\"\
      );\n}"

  notes: This method likely checks for items with zero or very low value, often excluding
    equipped items and quest-related items. It may also consider item quality thresholds
    and player's inventory capacity when determining what constitutes 'junk'. Performance-wise,
    it should be lightweight as it only performs a scan of the inventory without complex
    calculations.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on this method for critical game logic, as it
    might not account for all edge cases such as temporary enchantments or items with
    special flags. Also, ensure that the player's inventory state is up-to-date before
    calling this method to avoid stale results.
