  class: HotStreakTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void HotStreakTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the hot streak tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in HotStreakTracker is responsible for refreshing
    and maintaining the internal state of a player's hot streak condition. This typically
    involves checking the current status of the player's spell casting, tracking whether
    they have recently cast a damaging spell that could trigger a hot streak effect,
    and updating relevant timers or counters. The method operates on a provided Player
    object representing a bot, ensuring that the hot streak tracking logic remains
    synchronized with the player's current game state. It is commonly invoked during
    AI decision-making cycles or when specific combat events occur.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose hot streak
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n\
      \    {\n        hotStreakTracker.Update(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Event Handling
    code: "void HotStreakTracker::OnSpellCast(Player* bot, SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    // Update hot streak tracker when a damaging spell is cast\n    if (spellInfo\
      \ && spellInfo->IsDamageSpell())\n    {\n        Update(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the bot's AI update cycle to
    ensure accurate tracking of hot streak conditions. It is designed to be lightweight
    and non-blocking, making it suitable for frequent invocation without performance
    impact.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing an invalid pointer may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, avoid calling this method outside of appropriate game update contexts where
    player state changes are expected.
