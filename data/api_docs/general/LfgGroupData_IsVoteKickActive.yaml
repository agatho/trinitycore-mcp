documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a vote kick is currently active for the group.
  description: The IsVoteKickActive method determines if there is an ongoing vote
    kick process within the LFG (Looking for Group) group. This functionality is used
    in World of Warcraft's group finding system to manage player interactions and
    group stability. When a vote kick is active, it typically means that the group
    is in the process of voting to remove a specific member from the group. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating the current state of this vote kick process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a vote kick is currently active for the group; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Vote Kick is Active
    code: "if (groupData->IsVoteKickActive()) {\n    // Handle ongoing vote kick\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Vote kick is currently active.\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with normal group operations\n    sLog->outString(\"No active vote\
      \ kick.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system and should only be called on valid
    LfgGroupData objects. The implementation likely checks internal state flags or
    timers related to vote kick processes.
