documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ComplaintTicket instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~ComplaintTicket destructor is automatically invoked when a ComplaintTicket
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, and associated
    game state related to the complaint ticket. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor handles the release of resources tied to
    player complaints, such as ticket identifiers, associated player data, and any
    temporary storage used during the complaint handling process. The destructor is
    called implicitly by the C++ runtime and should not be invoked manually.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ComplaintTicket
    code: "void HandleComplaint() {\n    ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();\n\
      \    // ... process complaint ...\n    delete ticket; // Destructor called here\n\
      }\n\n// Or with automatic storage:\nvoid ProcessTicket() {\n    ComplaintTicket\
      \ ticket; // Constructor called\n    // ... use ticket ...\n    // Destructor\
      \ automatically called when ticket goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a critical part of the object lifecycle management in TrinityCore.
    It ensures that no memory leaks occur when complaint tickets are discarded, which
    is especially important in long-running server environments where many tickets
    may be created and destroyed over time. The implementation likely includes cleanup
    of internal linked lists, database references, or other resources.
