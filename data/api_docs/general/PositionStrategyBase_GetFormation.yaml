  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: GetFormation
  signature: FormationType PositionStrategyBase::GetFormation() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation type associated with the position strategy.
  description: The GetFormation method returns the FormationType enum value that represents
    the current formation configuration of the position strategy. This is typically
    used in AI behavior systems where units need to maintain specific spatial arrangements
    relative to each other or a target. The returned formation type determines how
    positions are calculated and updated within the strategy. This method does not
    modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationType enum value indicating the current formation configuration.
    Possible values may include FLAT, CIRCLE, LINE, or other formation types defined
    in the TrinityCore AI system. The exact enumeration values depend on the implementation
    but typically represent common tactical formations used by NPCs and creatures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "PositionStrategyBase* strategy = ...;\nFormationType currentFormation =\
      \ strategy->GetFormation();\nif (currentFormation == FORMATION_LINE)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle line formation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is const and does not perform any side effects. It's designed
    to be called frequently during AI update cycles without performance concerns.
    The formation type returned should be consistent across calls unless explicitly
    changed by other methods in the class.
