  class: Quest
  method: GetPOIy
  signature: float Quest::GetPOIy() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Y coordinate of the quest's point of interest.
  description: This method retrieves the Y coordinate value of the quest's point of
    interest (POI) from the database. It is used in conjunction with GetPOIX and GetPOIZ
    to determine the spatial position of a quest objective within the game world.
    The returned value represents the vertical coordinate in the game world's coordinate
    system, typically used for positioning quest markers or NPCs related to the quest.
    This method is commonly used in quest scripts and event handling to accurately
    place quest-related objects in the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: The Y coordinate value of the quest's point of interest as a float. This
    value represents the vertical position in the game world coordinate system, typically
    ranging from 0.0 to 10000.0 depending on the specific quest and map context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float yCoord = quest->GetPOIy();\n\nif (yCoord > 0)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ Y coordinate for positioning\n    // Do something with the coordinate\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other POI methods to determine quest objectives. It should be noted that
    the returned value may vary based on the quest's specific database configuration
    and may not always represent a meaningful coordinate in all contexts.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return invalid coordinates
    if the quest POI data is not properly defined in the database, potentially leading
    to incorrect positioning of quest-related objects in the world.
