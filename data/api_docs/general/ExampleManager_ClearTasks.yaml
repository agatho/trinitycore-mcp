  signature: void ExampleManager::ClearTasks()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all active tasks from the ExampleManager instance
  description: The ClearTasks method removes and destroys all currently managed tasks
    within the ExampleManager. This operation is typically used to reset the manager's
    state or free up resources associated with pending tasks. The method does not
    return any value and will invalidate all task references held by the manager.
    This functionality is commonly employed during cleanup operations, server shutdowns,
    or when resetting a manager's internal state to ensure no lingering tasks affect
    subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ExampleManager manager;

      // ... add some tasks ...

      manager.ClearTasks(); // Removes all tasks from the manager'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cleanup Before Shutdown
    code: "void ShutdownProcess()\n{\n    ExampleManager* mgr = GetExampleManager();\n\
      \    if (mgr)\n    {\n        mgr->ClearTasks(); // Ensure no tasks remain before\
      \ shutdown\n        delete mgr;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete reset of the task list. Any references to
    previously added tasks become invalid after calling this method. The operation
    is generally fast but may involve memory deallocation for each task, so performance
    impact should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling ClearTasks on a manager that is actively processing tasks may
    lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks if the tasks are not properly synchronized.
    Ensure all tasks have completed or been cancelled before invoking this method.
