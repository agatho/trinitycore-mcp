  brief: Checks if the player is invited to join a specific battleground instance.
  description: This method determines whether the player has been invited to participate
    in a specific battleground instance. It checks the player's invitation status
    for the given instance ID, which is typically used during battleground matchmaking
    and queueing processes. The method returns true if the player has received an
    invitation to join the specified battleground instance, false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for managing player participation in battlegrounds and
    ensuring proper queue handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is invited for the specified battleground instance,
    false otherwise. The method essentially checks if the player has received an invitation
    to join the battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->IsInvitedForBattlegroundInstance(1234)) {\n    // Player is\
      \ invited for this battleground instance\n    // Proceed with appropriate actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with battleground queue management
    systems. The instanceId parameter represents the unique identifier for a specific
    battleground instance, which may be assigned during matchmaking or when the player
    is invited to join a particular battleground.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking if
    a player is in a battleground, as it only checks invitation status and not actual
    participation. The method does not account for players who might have already
    joined the battleground but are not yet in the instance.
