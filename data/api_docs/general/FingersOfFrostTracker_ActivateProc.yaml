  class: FingersOfFrostTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void FingersOfFrostTracker::ActivateProc(uint32 stacks)
documentation:
  brief: Activates the Fingers of Frost proc effect with the specified stack count.
  description: The ActivateProc method is used to trigger the Fingers of Frost spell
    proc effect within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically handles the
    logic for applying or updating the proc state when a player's spell hits an enemy,
    increasing the chance of generating a frostbolt. The method accepts a stack count
    parameter that determines how many times the proc effect should be applied or
    incremented. It is commonly used in conjunction with spell hit events and aura
    management systems to ensure proper proc behavior and stacking mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: stacks
    description: The number of stacks to apply to the Fingers of Frost proc effect.
      Valid values are typically positive integers representing the number of times
      the proc should be triggered or incremented.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Activation
    code: 'FingersOfFrostTracker* tracker = player->GetFingersOfFrostTracker();

      tracker->ActivateProc(1); // Activate one stack of Fingers of Frost'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Stack Activation
    code: 'FingersOfFrostTracker* tracker = player->GetFingersOfFrostTracker();

      uint32 stacks = 3;

      tracker->ActivateProc(stacks); // Activate three stacks of Fingers of Frost'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from spell hit handlers or aura application
    logic. The implementation may involve updating internal state variables, triggering
    visual effects, and potentially modifying the player's spell casting behavior.
    Ensure that the tracker object is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer exceptions.
  warnings: Calling ActivateProc with zero stacks may result in unexpected behavior
    depending on the implementation. Make sure to validate stack counts before passing
    them to this method, especially when dealing with dynamic calculations or user
    input.
