  class: CalendarMgr

  signature: void CalendarMgr::AddEvent(CalendarEvent * calendarEvent, CalendarSendEventType
    sendType)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a calendar event to the calendar manager with specified send type.
  description: The AddEvent method is responsible for registering a CalendarEvent
    object within the CalendarMgr system. It processes the event and sends notifications
    to relevant players based on the provided CalendarSendEventType. This method integrates
    with the World of Warcraft calendar system, allowing game events such as raids,
    holidays, or player-created events to be properly scheduled and communicated to
    participants. The sendType parameter determines how the event notification is
    delivered, whether directly to attendees, through guild channels, or via other
    communication methods. The method performs necessary validation on the input event
    before adding it to the calendar storage.
  parameters:
  - name: calendarEvent
    description: Pointer to a CalendarEvent object that contains all the event details
      including title, description, date/time, type, and attendees. This object must
      be properly initialized with valid data before being passed to this method.
  - name: sendType
    description: Enumeration value of type CalendarSendEventType that specifies how
      the event notification should be sent. Valid values typically include sending
      directly to attendees, broadcasting to guild members, or notifying via system
      messages.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = new CalendarEvent();

      // Initialize event fields

      CalendarMgr::AddEvent(event, CALENDAR_SEND_TYPE_INVITE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding a Guild Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent* guildEvent = new CalendarEvent();

      guildEvent->SetType(CALENDAR_EVENT_TYPE_RAID);

      CalendarMgr::AddEvent(guildEvent, CALENDAR_SEND_TYPE_GUILD);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CalendarEvent object passed in is valid and
    properly initialized. The calendar manager will handle persistence of the event
    to the database. Be aware that this method may trigger additional operations such
    as sending emails or in-game messages depending on the send type specified.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for calendarEvent will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crash. Ensure all required fields in CalendarEvent are set before
    calling AddEvent. The method does not validate event dates against current time,
    so invalid dates may cause issues later when processing events.
