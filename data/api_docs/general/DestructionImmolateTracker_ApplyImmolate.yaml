  class: DestructionImmolateTracker
  method: ApplyImmolate
  signature: void DestructionImmolateTracker::ApplyImmolate(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies an Immolate effect to a target with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyImmolate method is used to apply the Immolate spell effect
    to a target entity identified by its GUID. This method typically manages the application
    of the DoT (Damage over Time) effect associated with the Immolate spell, which
    is commonly used by Warlocks in World of Warcraft. The duration parameter controls
    how long the Immolate effect will persist on the target. This method likely interacts
    with the game's combat system to track active effects and manage damage ticks
    over time.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity to apply the Immolate
      effect to. This is typically a player or creature GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Immolate effect should
      remain active on the target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ApplyImmolate
    code: 'DestructionImmolateTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyImmolate(12345, 15000); // Apply Immolate to target with GUID 12345
      for 15 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Immolate with dynamic duration
    code: 'uint32 spellDuration = 10000; // 10 seconds

      DestructionImmolateTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyImmolate(playerGuid, spellDuration); // Apply to player for specified
      duration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's aura system and combat log
    tracking. The implementation may involve checking if the target already has an
    Immolate effect active and handling stacking or refresh behavior accordingly.
    Performance considerations should be taken into account when applying effects
    to multiple targets simultaneously.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID parameter refers to a valid target entity, as applying
    effects to invalid or non-existent entities could cause undefined behavior. The
    duration value should be within reasonable bounds to prevent excessive memory
    usage or game state corruption.
