  method: IsBotChar
  signature: bool AuctionBotConfig::IsBotChar(int characterID) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given character ID corresponds to an auction bot character.
  description: The IsBotChar method checks if a specified character ID is associated
    with an auction bot within the TrinityCore Auction House system. This utility
    function is typically used by the AuctionBot module to distinguish between regular
    player characters and automated bot characters when processing auction listings,
    bids, or other auction-related activities. The method performs a lookup in the
    internal configuration or database records that track which characters are designated
    as bots. It ensures that bot-specific logic is only applied to appropriate accounts
    and prevents interference with real player operations.
  parameters:
  - name: characterID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to check. This should
      be a positive integer representing a valid character in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the provided character ID is registered as an auction bot
    character; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to verify if a character is a bot
    code: "if (AuctionBotConfig::IsBotChar(12345)) {\n    // Handle bot-specific logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Character ID 12345 is an auction bot.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle regular player logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Character ID 12345\
      \ is not an auction bot.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using within auction processing loop
    code: "for (auto& bid : auctionBids) {\n    if (AuctionBotConfig::IsBotChar(bid->bidderGuid))\
      \ {\n        // Skip bot bids or apply special handling\n        continue;\n\
      \    }\n    // Process real player bids normally\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal caching or database lookups, so repeated
    calls for the same character ID may be optimized. The implementation assumes that
    bot characters are pre-configured in the system and their IDs are stored in a
    dedicated lookup structure.
  warnings: Ensure that the characterID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing character in the database; invalid or non-existent IDs could lead
    to unexpected behavior or errors depending on how the underlying lookup is implemented.
