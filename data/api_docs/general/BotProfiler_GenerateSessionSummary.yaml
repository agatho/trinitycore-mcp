  class: BotProfiler
  method: GenerateSessionSummary
  signature: void BotProfiler::GenerateSessionSummary(const ProfilingSession * session,
    std::string & summary)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a human-readable summary of a profiling session's data and statistics.
  description: The GenerateSessionSummary method takes a ProfilingSession object and
    constructs a formatted string containing key performance metrics, session duration,
    and other relevant data points. This method is typically used for logging or displaying
    bot performance information in the game server console or debug output. It aggregates
    various profiling counters and timestamps to provide an overview of how the bot
    performed during its active session. The summary includes details such as total
    execution time, number of actions processed, average response times, and any errors
    encountered during the session.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A pointer to the ProfilingSession object containing the profiling
      data to be summarized. Must not be null.
  - name: summary
    description: A reference to a std::string where the generated summary will be
      stored. The string is overwritten with the new summary content.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      ProfilingSession* session = new ProfilingSession();

      // ... populate session data ...

      std::string summary;

      profiler.GenerateSessionSummary(session, summary);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Session Summary:\n%s", summary.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ProfilingSession object passed in has been properly
    initialized and populated with valid profiling data. The generated summary string
    may contain newlines and formatted text for readability. It is recommended to
    call this method only after all profiling data has been collected to ensure accurate
    results.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the session parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior or a crash. Ensure that the ProfilingSession object is valid
    before calling this method. The summary string will be overwritten without warning,
    so make sure to store any previous content if needed.
