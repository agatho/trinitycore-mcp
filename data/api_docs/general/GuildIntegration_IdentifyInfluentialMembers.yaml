documentation:
  brief: Identifies and processes the most influential guild members based on activity
    and contribution metrics.
  description: The IdentifyInfluentialMembers method analyzes guild member data to
    determine which players hold significant influence within the guild. This typically
    involves evaluating player activity, participation in guild events, contribution
    levels, and other relevant metrics. The method is designed to support guild management
    systems by identifying key contributors who may be suitable for leadership roles
    or special recognition. It likely updates internal tracking structures or triggers
    notifications about influential members. This method operates on a specified guild
    identified by its unique ID and does not return any direct data but modifies internal
    state or triggers related processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.IdentifyInfluentialMembers(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to gather member statistics
    and may involve performance considerations for large guilds. It should be called
    during appropriate maintenance windows or when guild data is known to be stable.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    guild, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method might not be thread-safe if
    it modifies shared internal state without synchronization.
