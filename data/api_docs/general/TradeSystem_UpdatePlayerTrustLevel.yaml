  signature: void TradeSystem::UpdatePlayerTrustLevel(uint32 playerGuid, uint32 targetGuid,
    float trustDelta)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the trust level between two players in the trading system.
  description: The UpdatePlayerTrustLevel method modifies the trust relationship between
    a player and their trading partner within the TrinityCore trade system. This function
    adjusts a numerical trust value that influences trading behavior, such as allowing
    or restricting certain trade operations based on the established trust level.
    The method accepts two GUIDs representing the player and target, along with a
    delta value that determines how much the trust should change. It is typically
    invoked during trade interactions to reflect changes in player relationships or
    trading history.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose trust level is being
      updated.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player with whom the trust
      relationship is being modified.
  - name: trustDelta
    description: A floating-point value indicating the change in trust level. Positive
      values increase trust, negative values decrease it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase Trust Level
    code: TradeSystem::UpdatePlayerTrustLevel(12345, 67890, 5.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrease Trust Level
    code: TradeSystem::UpdatePlayerTrustLevel(12345, 67890, -2.5f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal trust tracking systems and may
    trigger updates to player reputation or trade restrictions. The trust delta is
    usually clamped to prevent extreme values that could break gameplay balance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUIDs correspond to valid players in the current
    session, as invalid GUIDs might cause undefined behavior or errors. Also, avoid
    using large trust deltas that could unbalance the trading system.
