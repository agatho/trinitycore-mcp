documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score for applying the rest strategy
    based on bot's current state and conditions.
  description: The GetRelevance method evaluates how relevant or necessary it is for
    a bot to execute the rest strategy at the current moment. It takes into account
    various factors such as the bot's health, mana levels, position relative to a
    resting location, and overall game state. This relevance score is used by the
    AI decision-making system to prioritize which strategies should be executed next.
    A higher return value indicates that the bot should prioritize resting, while
    a lower or zero value suggests that resting is not currently needed or beneficial.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of the rest strategy. Values
    typically range from 0.0 (not relevant at all) to 1.0 (highly relevant). The exact
    scale and interpretation may depend on internal AI logic, but generally, scores
    above a certain threshold trigger the execution of the rest behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision loop
    code: "float relevance = restStrategy.GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.5f)\
      \ {\n    // Execute rest behavior\n    ai->SetNextStrategy(\"rest\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using relevance to prioritize strategies
    code: "float healthRelevance = healthStrategy.GetRelevance(ai);\nfloat restRelevance\
      \ = restStrategy.GetRelevance(ai);\nif (healthRelevance > restRelevance) {\n\
      \    ai->SetNextStrategy(\"health\");\n} else {\n    ai->SetNextStrategy(\"\
      rest\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during the AI's decision-making
    cycle. It should be lightweight and not perform heavy computations or database
    lookups. The relevance calculation may involve checking if the bot is already
    resting, whether it has sufficient resources to rest safely, and how far away
    from a valid rest location the bot currently is.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in contexts where it might cause
    performance bottlenecks due to repeated calculations. Also, be aware that the
    relevance score may fluctuate rapidly based on dynamic conditions like health
    changes or environmental factors, so caching results for too long could lead to
    outdated decisions.
