  signature: void BotPacketSimulator::DisablePeriodicTimeSync()
documentation:
  brief: Disables periodic time synchronization for bot packet simulation.
  description: The DisablePeriodicTimeSync method stops the automatic periodic time
    synchronization mechanism within the BotPacketSimulator class. This functionality
    is typically used to prevent the simulator from periodically adjusting or synchronizing
    timestamps, which may be necessary when performing controlled testing or when
    precise timing control is required. The method does not accept any parameters
    and has no return value. It directly modifies internal state to disable the time
    synchronization loop.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disable periodic time sync in bot simulation
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator simulator;

      simulator.DisablePeriodicTimeSync();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal timers or threads responsible for time
    synchronization. It should be called before starting any test scenarios that require
    deterministic timing behavior.
