  signature: void SmartAI::PassengerBoarded(Unit * who, int8 seatId, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a unit is boarded as a passenger on a vehicle in SmartAI.
  description: The PassengerBoarded method is invoked by the SmartAI system when a
    Unit (such as a player or creature) is successfully boarded as a passenger onto
    a vehicle. This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during vehicle interaction events, and it allows for custom AI behavior to be
    executed when passengers board a vehicle. The method provides information about
    which unit boarded, the seat ID they occupied, and whether the boarding action
    was applied or removed. It serves as an event handler that can trigger scripted
    actions within SmartAI-based creature behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is being boarded as a passenger.
      This could be a player or another creature.
  - name: seatId
    description: The seat ID on the vehicle where the unit was boarded. Negative values
      may indicate special or unoccupied seats, while positive integers represent
      specific passenger seats.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the boarding action is being applied
      (true) or removed (false). This allows distinguishing between boarding and dismounting
      events.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Passenger Boarded Event Handler
    code: "void SmartAI::PassengerBoarded(Unit* who, int8 seatId, bool apply)\n{\n\
      \    if (apply)\n    {\n        // Perform actions when a passenger boards\n\
      \        Talk(0, who->GetGUID());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Perform\
      \ actions when a passenger dismounts\n        Talk(1, who->GetGUID());\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI event system and is automatically invoked
    by the core framework during vehicle boarding events. Developers should ensure
    that any logic within this function does not cause performance bottlenecks, especially
    if multiple passengers are boarding simultaneously.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from custom AI code unless you understand
    its internal behavior; it's intended to be triggered by the SmartAI system only.
    Incorrect use of the 'apply' parameter may result in unexpected behavior during
    vehicle interactions.
