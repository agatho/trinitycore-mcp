documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PetitionMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PetitionMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the petition management system exists
    throughout the TrinityCore server runtime. This method is typically used to access
    global petition-related functionality such as handling guild petitions, character
    signatures, and petition validation. The returned pointer provides access to all
    petition management operations within the World of Warcraft server environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single PetitionMgr instance. The method never returns
    NULL as it is implemented as a singleton with guaranteed instantiation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Petition Manager
    code: 'PetitionMgr* petitionMgr = PetitionMgr::instance();

      // Use petitionMgr to access petition functionality

      uint32 petitionCount = petitionMgr->GetPetitionCount();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Petition Manager in Guild Creation
    code: "PetitionMgr* mgr = PetitionMgr::instance();\nif (mgr)\n{\n    // Validate\
      \ guild petition\n    Petition* petition = mgr->GetPetitionByGuid(petitionGuid);\n\
      \    if (petition && petition->IsSigned())\n    {\n        // Proceed with guild\
      \ creation\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented as a singleton pattern. The
    PetitionMgr instance is created during server initialization and persists for
    the entire runtime of the TrinityCore server.
