  brief: Handles interaction with a player's corpse during death recovery process
  description: The InteractWithCorpse method manages the core logic for interacting
    with a player's corpse when entering the death recovery state. This method typically
    handles corpse validation, resource retrieval, and state transitions for players
    who have died but are still in the process of recovering from death. It ensures
    that proper cleanup and recovery procedures are followed before allowing the player
    to respawn or continue gameplay. The method may also handle corpse decay timers,
    loot distribution, and other death-related mechanics depending on the server configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the corpse interaction was successfully processed and the
    recovery state was properly updated; returns false if the interaction failed due
    to invalid state, missing corpse data, or other error conditions that prevent
    proper recovery.
  examples:
  - title: Basic corpse interaction handling
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager->InteractWithCorpse()) {\n    // Corpse handled\
      \ successfully\n    // Proceed with death recovery logic\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ failed corpse interaction\n    // Log error or notify player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the death recovery phase of a player's
    lifecycle. It assumes that the player has already been marked as dead and that
    corpse data is available in the system. The method may perform database operations
    to update player state and should be called only when appropriate death recovery
    conditions are met.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of the proper death recovery
    context, as it may cause undefined behavior or database inconsistencies if invoked
    with invalid player states. Ensure that all preconditions for corpse interaction
    are validated before calling this method.
