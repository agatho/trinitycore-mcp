documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a game object.
  description: The IsGameObject method checks if the current ObjectGuid instance refers
    to a game object within the TrinityCore world. This method examines the type bits
    of the GUID to determine if it matches the GameObject type mask. It is commonly
    used in game logic to validate that an object reference points to a valid game
    object rather than a player, creature, or other entity type. The check is performed
    efficiently using bitwise operations on the GUID's internal representation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a game object; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate GameObject GUID
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::GameObject>(12345);\nif\
      \ (guid.IsGameObject())\n{\n    // Process as a game object\n    printf(\"Valid\
      \ game object GUID\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic for object handling
    code: "void HandleObjectInteraction(ObjectGuid guid)\n{\n    if (guid.IsGameObject())\n\
      \    {\n        // This is a game object, perform game object specific actions\n\
      \        GameObject* go = ObjectAccessor::GetGameObject(*player, guid);\n  \
      \      if (go)\n        {\n            go->HandleEvent(player, 0);\n       \
      \ }\n    }\n    else if (guid.IsCreature())\n    {\n        // Handle creature\
      \ logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a fast bitwise check against the GUID's high bits to
    determine object type. It does not validate whether the actual object exists in
    the world, only that the GUID format indicates it should be a game object. The
    implementation relies on the TrinityCore GUID structure where different object
    types are distinguished by specific bit patterns in the high portion of the GUID.
  warnings: This method only validates the GUID's type bits and does not verify if
    the actual object exists or is valid in the current world context. Using this
    method without additional validation may lead to accessing invalid object references
    if the GUID is stale or refers to a deleted object.
