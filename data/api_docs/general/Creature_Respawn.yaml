documentation:
  brief: Respawns a creature to its original location and resets its health and mana.
  description: The Respawn method restores a creature to its initial state by teleporting
    it back to its spawn position and resetting its health and mana values. This method
    is typically used when a creature has been killed or is in a state where it needs
    to be reset for future encounters. The force parameter allows for overriding the
    default behavior, enabling immediate respawn even if the creature's respawn timer
    has not elapsed. This method is essential for managing creature behavior in World
    of Warcraft instances and raids.
  parameters:
  - name: force
    description: When true, forces immediate respawn regardless of the creature's
      current respawn timer status. When false, the respawn will only occur if the
      creature's respawn timer has expired.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Respawn Usage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->Respawn();

      // Creature respawns to its original location'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Respawn Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->Respawn(true);

      // Forces immediate respawn regardless of timer'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally calls the creature's spawn position teleportation and
    resets its health/mana values. It's important to note that this method does not
    actually destroy the creature object; it only resets its state. The method should
    be used carefully in scenarios where creature behavior needs to be controlled,
    such as in raid encounters or instance resets.
  warnings: Using force parameter can cause unexpected behavior if the creature is
    part of a larger encounter or instance. It's recommended to use this method only
    when necessary and after ensuring that no other players or NPCs are affected by
    the respawn.
