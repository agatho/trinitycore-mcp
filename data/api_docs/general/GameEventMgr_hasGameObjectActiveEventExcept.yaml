  class: GameEventMgr
  method: hasGameObjectActiveEventExcept
  signature: bool GameEventMgr::hasGameObjectActiveEventExcept(int go_guid, uint16
    event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a game object has an active event running, excluding a specified
    event ID.
  description: The hasGameObjectActiveEventExcept method determines whether a specific
    game object is currently associated with any active game events, while excluding
    a particular event ID from consideration. This functionality is essential for
    managing dynamic world objects during event periods, allowing certain events to
    be skipped or ignored when checking for active states. The method typically operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's GameEvent system, which controls temporary
    changes to the game world such as holidays, seasonal events, or special quests.
    It helps prevent conflicts or redundant activations when one event should not
    interfere with another.
  parameters:
  - name: go_guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the game object being checked for
      active events.
  - name: event_id
    description: The event ID to exclude from the check. If any other events are active,
      the method will return true.
  returns: Returns true if there is at least one active game event associated with
    the specified game object, excluding the provided event ID. Returns false if no
    active events exist for the object or if only the excluded event is active.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject Has Active Events Except a Specific One
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->hasGameObjectActiveEventExcept(12345, 10)) {\n    //\
      \ The game object with GUID 12345 has an active event other than event ID 10\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Either no events are active or only event 10 is active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal data structures to track which game objects
    are associated with active events. It may involve lookups in event-related tables
    or caches within the GameEventMgr class. Performance depends on how efficiently
    these associations are stored and retrieved.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid game object, as invalid
    inputs might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Also, be cautious
    when using this method during event transitions, since active events may change
    dynamically.
