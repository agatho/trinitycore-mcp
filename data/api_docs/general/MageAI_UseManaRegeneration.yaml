documentation:
  brief: Manages and executes mana regeneration logic for a Mage AI-controlled unit.
  description: The UseManaRegeneration method is responsible for handling the automatic
    mana recovery behavior of a Mage AI character. This method typically checks if
    the mage should regenerate mana based on game rules, such as not being in combat
    or having sufficient time elapsed since last regeneration. It may also consider
    factors like spell cooldowns, mana pool size, and AI decision-making logic to
    determine when and how much mana should be restored. The method ensures that the
    Mage's mana resource is properly managed according to both game mechanics and
    AI strategy.

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    if (HasManaRegenerationAbility())\n        UseManaRegeneration();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked within the MageAI's update loop or during
    specific state transitions. It's important to note that mana regeneration may
    be suppressed during combat or under certain spell effects, so internal checks
    are likely performed before actual resource restoration occurs.
