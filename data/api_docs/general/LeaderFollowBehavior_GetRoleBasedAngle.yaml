  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetRoleBasedAngle
  signature: float LeaderFollowBehavior::GetRoleBasedAngle(int role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the angle offset based on the specified role for leader-follow
    behavior in group settings.
  description: The GetRoleBasedAngle method computes a specific angular offset that
    determines where a follower should position themselves relative to the leader
    based on their assigned role within the group. This is commonly used in group
    movement mechanics, such as when players follow a leader in a raid or dungeon
    setting. The method takes an integer role parameter and returns a float representing
    the angle in radians. Different roles (such as tank, healer, damage dealer) may
    have different positioning requirements to maintain optimal group formation and
    spacing.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: An integer identifier representing the player's role within the group.
      Valid values typically correspond to predefined roles like 0 for tank, 1 for
      healer, 2 for damage dealer, etc. The exact mapping depends on the implementation
      and game context.
  returns: A float value representing the angular offset in radians. Positive values
    indicate a clockwise rotation from the leader's facing direction, while negative
    values indicate counter-clockwise rotation. The returned angle determines optimal
    positioning for the follower based on their role.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get angle for healer role
    code: 'float angle = leaderFollowBehavior->GetRoleBasedAngle(1); // Get angle
      for healer role

      // Use this angle to position the healer behind and slightly to the side of
      the leader'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using returned angle for positioning in group movement
    code: 'int playerRole = GetPlayerRole();

      float angleOffset = leaderFollowBehavior->GetRoleBasedAngle(playerRole);

      float followerX = leaderX + cos(angleOffset) * followDistance;

      float followerY = leaderY + sin(angleOffset) * followDistance;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI behavior methods
    to create dynamic group positioning. The exact angle values returned depend on
    the internal configuration and may vary between different game versions or custom
    implementations.
  warnings: Ensure that the role parameter passed is within valid range; invalid roles
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect positioning calculations.
