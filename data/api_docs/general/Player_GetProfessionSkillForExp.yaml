  signature: uint32 Player::GetProfessionSkillForExp(uint32 skill, int32 expansion)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the skill level of a player's profession for a given expansion.
  description: This method retrieves the current skill level of a specific profession
    for the player, considering the expansion associated with that skill. It is commonly
    used to determine how much progress a player has made in their profession skills,
    particularly when dealing with expansion-specific skill requirements. The method
    returns the skill value as an integer, which can be used to calculate progression
    or determine if a player has reached certain skill milestones.
  parameters:
  - name: skill
    description: The skill ID of the profession for which to retrieve the skill level.
      This is typically a numeric identifier representing a specific profession (e.g.,
      Engineering, First Aid).
  - name: expansion
    description: The expansion level associated with the skill. This parameter determines
      which expansion's skill level to return. Valid values include 0 for classic,
      1 for Burning Crusade, and 2 for Wrath of the Lich King.
  returns: The method returns a uint32 representing the current skill level of the
    specified profession for the given expansion. If no skill is found or if the expansion
    does not match the skill's expansion, it will return 0.
  examples:
  - title: Get Profession Skill Level
    code: uint32 skillLevel = player->GetProfessionSkillForExp(164, 1); // Get Engineering
      skill level for Burning Crusade expansion
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Skill Progression
    code: uint32 skillLevel = player->GetProfessionSkillForExp(129, 0); // Get First
      Aid skill level for classic expansion
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    to determine how much progress a player has made in their profession. It may be
    affected by various game mechanics such as skill caps or expansion-specific skill
    requirements.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly calculate skill progression
    without considering the skill cap or expansion-specific requirements, as it only
    returns the current skill level without accounting for potential skill points
    or other factors.
