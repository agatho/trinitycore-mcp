  method: GetNearbyEnemies
  signature: uint32 FrostMageRefactored::GetNearbyEnemies(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemies method determines and returns the total count
    of hostile units (such as players or creatures) that are currently within the
    specified range of the FrostMageRefactored instance. This functionality is commonly
    used in AI decision-making processes to assess threat levels, determine optimal
    spell usage, or evaluate combat positioning. The method typically iterates through
    nearby objects in the game world and filters them based on faction or hostility
    criteria. It does not modify any internal state and is designed for efficient
    querying during AI update cycles.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of enemy units found within the
    specified range. Returns zero if no enemies are detected in range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Threat Level
    code: "uint32 enemyCount = frostMage->GetNearbyEnemies(10.0f);\nif (enemyCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Initiate combat behavior\n    frostMage->CastSpell(SpellId::FrostNova);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Enemy Count for Spell Selection
    code: "uint32 nearbyEnemies = frostMage->GetNearbyEnemies(8.0f);\nif (nearbyEnemies\
      \ >= 3)\n{\n    frostMage->CastSpell(SpellId::Blizzard);\n}\nelse if (nearbyEnemies\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    frostMage->CastSpell(SpellId::Frostbolt);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore AI system and spatial queries.
    Performance can be affected by the number of nearby objects and the accuracy of
    the range check. The method may not account for line-of-sight restrictions unless
    explicitly implemented in the core logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is appropriate to avoid unnecessary performance
    overhead or incorrect behavior due to excessively large ranges. This method assumes
    valid internal state; calling it on an uninitialized or destroyed instance may
    result in undefined behavior.
