  class: RBACData
  method: RemoveGrantedPermission
  signature: void RBACData::RemoveGrantedPermission(uint32 permissionId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a granted permission from the RBAC data structure by its ID.
  description: The RemoveGrantedPermission method removes a specific permission identified
    by its unique ID from the list of granted permissions within the RBAC (Role-Based
    Access Control) data. This method is typically used in the context of World of
    Warcraft's TrinityCore server to manage player access rights and privileges dynamically
    during runtime. It ensures that a player no longer has the specified permission,
    which can be useful for revoking admin commands, game features, or other restricted
    actions. The operation modifies the internal state of the RBACData object directly
    without returning any value.
  parameters:
  - name: permissionId
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to be removed from the granted
      permissions list. This ID must correspond to a valid permission defined in the
      server's RBAC system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a single granted permission
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      // Assume some permissions were previously added

      rbacData.RemoveGrantedPermission(12345); // Removes permission with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal granted permissions set directly. Ensure
    that the permission ID passed is valid and corresponds to an existing permission
    in the RBAC system to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent permission ID may
    lead to undefined behavior if not handled properly by the calling code. Always
    validate permission IDs before removal.
