  method: SendGlobalText
  signature: void World::SendGlobalText(const char * text, WorldSession * self)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a global text message to all connected players in the world.
  description: The SendGlobalText method broadcasts a specified text message to every
    player currently connected to the World of Warcraft server. This function is typically
    used for server-wide announcements, maintenance notifications, or important game
    events that should be visible to all players. The method operates synchronously
    and sends the message through the global chat system, ensuring all players receive
    the notification regardless of their current location or zone. It does not require
    any specific player context beyond the provided session parameter which may be
    used for filtering or logging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: text
    description: A null-terminated character string containing the message to broadcast
      globally. This string should be properly formatted and escaped for client display.
  - name: self
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the sending session.
      This parameter may be used internally for logging or filtering purposes, but
      does not affect the broadcasting behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Global Announcement
    code: World::SendGlobalText("Server will restart in 5 minutes for maintenance.",
      nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: Announcing Game Event
    code: 'const char* eventMessage = "Weekly PvP tournament begins now! All players
      are welcome to participate.";

      World::SendGlobalText(eventMessage, session);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from server-side code and operates on the
    main game thread. It may have performance implications when sending frequent messages
    due to the broadcast nature of the operation. The text parameter should be properly
    sanitized to prevent client-side issues or exploits.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null text pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure all strings are properly null-terminated and safe
    for client display. Avoid calling this method excessively in tight loops as it
    may impact server performance.
