documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new PetInfo object with default values for pet-related data
    fields.
  description: The PetInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the PetInfo class,
    setting up default values for all internal pet data members such as pet type,
    level, experience, and status flags. This method is typically called when creating
    a new pet object or when resetting an existing pet's information to its initial
    state. The initialization ensures that all pet-related attributes are properly
    configured before any gameplay operations begin. This constructor does not require
    any parameters and prepares the object for subsequent configuration through other
    methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PetInfo instance
    code: 'PetInfo pet;

      // The pet object is now initialized with default values

      // Ready to be configured with specific pet data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs basic initialization of all member variables to
    their default states. It does not interact with the database or world state directly,
    but rather prepares the object structure for later population with actual pet
    data from game systems.
