  method: CanBeUsedAs
  signature: bool RuneInfo::CanBeUsedAs(RuneType requiredType) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the rune can be used as a specified rune type.
  description: The CanBeUsedAs method checks if the current RuneInfo instance is compatible
    with a given required rune type. This functionality is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's rune system, particularly for Death Knights, to verify if a rune
    can be consumed or replaced with a specific type of rune. The method evaluates
    internal rune properties against the provided type and returns true if they are
    compatible, false otherwise. This check is essential for proper rune management
    during abilities like Death Strike or other rune-based spells that require specific
    rune types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the rune can be used as the specified required type; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Rune Compatibility
    code: "RuneInfo rune;\n// Assume rune is initialized with a specific rune type\n\
      if (rune.CanBeUsedAs(RUNE_TYPE_BLOOD)) {\n    // The rune can be used as a blood\
      \ rune\n    printf(\"Rune is compatible with blood runes\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"Rune is not compatible with blood runes\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely compares the internal rune type of the RuneInfo object
    against the provided requiredType parameter. It may be used internally by TrinityCore's
    spell system to validate rune consumption or replacement operations.
