  method: SetData64
  signature: void GameObjectAI::SetData64(uint32 param0, uint64 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a 64-bit data value associated with a specific parameter identifier
    for the game object AI.
  description: The SetData64 method is used to store or update a 64-bit integer value
    linked to a specific parameter identifier within the GameObjectAI system. This
    functionality allows game objects to maintain persistent state information that
    can be retrieved later using corresponding getter methods. The method typically
    serves as part of a broader data management system where multiple data points
    can be stored and accessed by their unique identifiers. It is commonly used in
    scripted game object behaviors, quest systems, or event triggers where specific
    data needs to be preserved across different AI update cycles or interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The parameter identifier or key used to associate the 64-bit value.
      This serves as an index to retrieve the stored data later.
  - name: param1
    description: The 64-bit integer value to be stored and associated with the specified
      parameter identifier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a custom GameObject AI
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        // Set some data value\n        SetData64(1, 123456789012345ULL);\n\
      \        \n        // Later retrieve it\n        uint64 storedValue = GetData64(1);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetData64 for quest state tracking
    code: "class QuestTriggerGO : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\
      \ override {\n        // Store initial quest state\n        SetData64(QUEST_STATE_KEY,\
      \ 0ULL);\n    }\n    \n    void OnQuestAccept(Player* player) override {\n \
      \       // Update quest state\n        SetData64(QUEST_STATE_KEY, 1ULL);\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetData64 to provide a
    complete data storage and retrieval system. The parameter identifiers should be
    defined consistently across the codebase to avoid conflicts. The implementation
    may involve internal data structures that are optimized for fast access by parameter
    ID.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 values are unique and meaningful within your context
    to prevent accidental overwrites of important data. Be cautious when using this
    method in high-frequency update loops as it may have performance implications
    depending on the underlying storage mechanism.
