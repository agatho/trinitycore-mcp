  class: SmartGameObjectAI
  method: EventInform
  signature: void SmartGameObjectAI::EventInform(uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the smart game object AI of a specific event by its ID.
  description: The EventInform method is used to signal the SmartGameObjectAI that
    a particular event has occurred, identified by the eventId parameter. This method
    allows game objects with smart AI behavior to respond dynamically to various in-game
    events such as timers, player interactions, or other triggers. It serves as a
    communication mechanism between different parts of the game logic and the AI system,
    enabling conditional responses based on event occurrences. The method does not
    return any value and is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when an event is triggered for a smart game object.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: A unique identifier representing the specific event that has occurred.
      This ID corresponds to predefined events within the smart AI system, allowing
      the game object to determine how to respond based on the type of event received.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Notification
    code: "void MyGameObject::OnEventTriggered(uint32 eventId)\n{\n    if (m_ai)\n\
      \        m_ai->EventInform(eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Multiple Events in Smart AI
    code: "void SmartGameObjectAI::EventInform(uint32 eventId)\n{\n    switch (eventId)\n\
      \    {\n        case 1:\n            // Handle event 1\n            break;\n\
      \        case 2:\n            // Handle event 2\n            break;\n      \
      \  default:\n            // Default handling\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the smart AI framework in TrinityCore and should only
    be called on game objects that have been properly initialized with SmartGameObjectAI.
    The eventId parameter must correspond to a valid event defined within the smart
    AI system for proper behavior.
