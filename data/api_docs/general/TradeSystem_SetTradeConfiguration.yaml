  signature: void TradeSystem::SetTradeConfiguration(uint32 playerGuid, const TradeConfiguration
    & config)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the trade configuration for a specific player in the TradeSystem.
  description: The SetTradeConfiguration method allows developers to modify or set
    the trade settings for a given player identified by their GUID. This configuration
    typically includes parameters such as allowed trade types, maximum item counts,
    cooldown periods, and other gameplay-related restrictions. The method updates
    the internal state of the TradeSystem to reflect these new settings for the specified
    player. It is commonly used during player initialization, configuration changes,
    or when applying custom trade rules in game modifications or addons.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose trade configuration
      is being updated. This value must be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore
      database.
  - name: config
    description: A reference to a TradeConfiguration object containing the new trade
      settings for the player. This includes various trade-related parameters such
      as allowed item types, maximum trade amounts, and cooldown values.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TradeConfiguration config;

      config.maxItems = 10;

      config.cooldownSeconds = 300;

      config.allowGoldTrade = true;

      TradeSystem::SetTradeConfiguration(12345, config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Trade Settings
    code: 'uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      TradeConfiguration newConfig;

      newConfig.maxItems = 5;

      newConfig.cooldownSeconds = 600;

      newConfig.allowGoldTrade = false;

      newConfig.allowedItemClasses = {ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON, ITEM_CLASS_ARMOR};

      TradeSystem::SetTradeConfiguration(playerId, newConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the in-memory trade configuration for a player.
    Changes made using this method are not persisted to the database unless explicitly
    saved by other systems. The TradeSystem may cache configurations, so repeated
    calls with identical parameters might not trigger additional processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid corresponds to an actual logged-in player or
    existing character in the database. Passing invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Also, be cautious when modifying trade configurations during
    active trades as it may affect ongoing transactions.
