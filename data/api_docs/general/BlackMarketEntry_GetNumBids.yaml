  signature: int BlackMarketEntry::GetNumBids() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of bids placed on the black market item.
  description: The GetNumBids method retrieves the total count of bids that have been
    submitted for a specific black market auction item. This value represents how
    many players have shown interest in purchasing the item through the black market
    system. The method is typically used to display bidding information to players
    and to determine whether an auction has reached its minimum bid threshold or if
    it should be processed for sale. This count is updated dynamically as bids are
    placed by players during the auction period.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of bids placed on this black
    market item. Returns 0 if no bids have been placed yet.
  examples:
  - title: Displaying bid count for a black market item
    code: "void ShowBlackMarketInfo(BlackMarketEntry* entry)\n{\n    int bidCount\
      \ = entry->GetNumBids();\n    std::cout << \"Bids placed: \" << bidCount <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if an auction has received any bids
    code: "bool IsBlackMarketActive(BlackMarketEntry* entry)\n{\n    return entry->GetNumBids()\
      \ > 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached data about the auction
    state. It does not perform any database operations or calculations, making it
    efficient to call frequently. The returned value reflects the current state of
    bids at the time of the method call.
