documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is accepting whispers from game masters.
  description: This method determines if a player's account has the Game Master permission
    to receive whispers from other players. It returns true if the player is currently
    accepting whispers, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for game master
    operations as it allows GMs to control whether they can be reached by players
    through whispers, which is essential for maintaining proper communication channels
    in World of Warcraft. The method is typically used in conjunction with other GM-related
    functions to manage player interaction and communication.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is accepting whispers from game masters, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the player's account has the appropriate permissions
    to receive whispers from Game Masters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsGameMasterAcceptingWhispers()) {\n    // Player is accepting\
      \ whispers\n    // Do something here\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not accepting\
      \ whispers\n    // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's Game Master settings and relates to the
    player's account permissions. It should be used in conjunction with other GM-related
    methods to properly manage player communication. The method is thread-safe as
    it only reads from a player's account settings.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but rather controls
    the communication channel between players and Game Masters. Be cautious when using
    this method in conjunction with other GM functions, as improper use may lead to
    confusion or miscommunication.
