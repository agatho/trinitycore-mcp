  signature: bool CharmInfo::IsFollowing()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the charm is currently following its master.
  description: The IsFollowing method checks the current state of a charm to determine
    if it is actively following its master in the World of Warcraft game. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore server implementation to manage pet behavior
    and AI logic. The return value indicates whether the charm's movement state is
    set to follow mode, which affects how the charm responds to commands and interacts
    with its master. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper pet behavior
    in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the charm is currently following its master, false otherwise.
    The method evaluates the internal state of the charm's movement behavior to make
    this determination.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a charm is following its master
    code: "if (player->GetCharmInfo()->IsFollowing()) {\n    // Charm is currently\
      \ following the player\n    sLog->outString(\"Charm is following the player.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Charm is not following the player\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Charm is not following the player.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state tracking of charm movement behavior.
    The implementation likely checks flags or state variables within the CharmInfo
    class that are updated when commands like 'follow' or 'move' are issued to the
    charm. Performance is generally minimal as it's a simple state check.
