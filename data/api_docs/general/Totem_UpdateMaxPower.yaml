  class: Totem
  method: UpdateMaxPower
  signature: void Totem::UpdateMaxPower(int param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum power value of the totem based on the provided parameter.
  description: The UpdateMaxPower method adjusts the maximum power attribute of a
    Totem object. This method is typically invoked when the totem's power capacity
    needs to be recalculated or modified, such as when the totem's owner gains new
    abilities, levels up, or when environmental factors affect the totem's performance.
    The parameter passed to this method likely represents a modifier or base value
    that influences the totem's maximum power. This update may trigger internal recalculations
    of the totem's current power state and could affect gameplay mechanics related
    to mana, rage, or other resource systems associated with the totem.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer value that determines how the maximum power of the totem
      is updated. This parameter likely represents a modifier, base value, or scaling
      factor that influences the totem's power capacity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Totem Power with Modifier
    code: 'Totem* totem = player->GetTotem();

      totem->UpdateMaxPower(100); // Increases maximum power by 100 units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Totem Power Based on Player Level
    code: 'Totem* totem = player->GetTotem();

      int levelModifier = player->GetLevel() * 5;

      totem->UpdateMaxPower(levelModifier); // Adjusts power based on player''s level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the totem's power-related
    fields and may affect its behavior in combat or resource management. It is important
    to ensure that the parameter passed is valid and within expected ranges to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid or extreme values for param0 may cause unintended consequences
    in gameplay mechanics, such as overflow or underflow of power values. Always validate
    input before calling this method.
