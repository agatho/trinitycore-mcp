  class: ObjectMgr
  method: SetDBCLocaleIndex
  signature: void ObjectMgr::SetDBCLocaleIndex(LocaleConstant locale)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the DBC locale index for the object manager to control localized data
    retrieval.
  description: The SetDBCLocaleIndex method configures the internal locale setting
    used by the ObjectMgr class to determine which localized strings and data should
    be retrieved from DBC files. This is essential for supporting multiple languages
    in World of Warcraft, allowing the server to serve appropriate text, names, and
    descriptions based on the configured locale. The method updates an internal state
    variable that subsequent queries will use when fetching localized content from
    database cache or DBC files.
  parameters:
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant value specifying which language locale to set
      for DBC data retrieval. Valid values include LOCALE_enUS, LOCALE_koKR, LOCALE_frFR,
      LOCALE_deDE, LOCALE_zhCN, LOCALE_zhTW, LOCALE_esES, LOCALE_esMX, LOCALE_ruRU.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Locale to French
    code: ObjectMgr::instance()->SetDBCLocaleIndex(LOCALE_frFR);
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Server Locale at Startup
    code: "void InitializeServerLocales()\n{\n    // Set default locale based on configuration\n\
      \    LocaleConstant defaultLocale = sWorld->getDBCLocale();\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->SetDBCLocaleIndex(defaultLocale);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all subsequent DBC lookups performed by the ObjectMgr
    instance. It's typically called during server initialization or when a new player
    logs in with a different locale setting. The change is not persistent across server
    restarts and must be reapplied after each restart.
  warnings: Calling this method while active game sessions are running may cause inconsistencies
    in localized data displayed to players. Ensure that all players have been disconnected
    or that the locale change is synchronized properly before calling this method
    during runtime.
