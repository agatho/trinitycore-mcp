  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: DetectAnomalies
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::DetectAnomalies(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes market data for specified item to identify unusual pricing or trading
    patterns.
  description: The DetectAnomalies method performs a comprehensive analysis of auction
    house data for a given item ID, searching for irregularities such as sudden price
    spikes, abnormal bidding behavior, or statistically significant deviations from
    normal market trends. This function is typically used by in-game systems or administrative
    tools to monitor market stability and detect potential exploitation or manipulation.
    The method processes historical transaction data, current auction listings, and
    market demand indicators to generate anomaly reports. It does not modify any data
    but rather provides diagnostic information about market behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to analyze for market anomalies.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database with associated auction
      house records.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Anomaly Detection
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analyzer;

      analyzer.DetectAnomalies(18732); // Analyze for anomaly in Arcanite Rod'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Item Analysis
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nstd::vector<uint32> itemIds = {18732, 18733,\
      \ 18734};\nfor (uint32 id : itemIds)\n{\n    analyzer.DetectAnomalies(id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries and may have performance implications
    when analyzing high-volume items. It should be called asynchronously or during
    low-traffic periods to avoid server lag. The detection algorithm may use statistical
    models such as standard deviation thresholds or moving averages to identify outliers.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid item ID may result in undefined behavior
    or database errors. Ensure that the itemId parameter corresponds to a legitimate
    item in the game's item database before invoking this function.
