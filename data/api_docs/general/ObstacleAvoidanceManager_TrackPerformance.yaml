  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: TrackPerformance
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds
    duration, const std::string & operation)
documentation:
  brief: Records performance metrics for obstacle avoidance operations
  description: The TrackPerformance method logs timing information for obstacle avoidance
    operations to help monitor and optimize AI pathfinding behavior. This method is
    typically called internally by the AI system when completing obstacle avoidance
    tasks, recording how long specific operations take to execute. The recorded data
    can be used for performance analysis, debugging, or adjusting AI behavior parameters.
    It helps ensure that obstacle avoidance does not introduce significant lag or
    performance bottlenecks in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The time duration in microseconds that an obstacle avoidance operation
      took to complete
  - name: operation
    description: A string identifier describing the specific type of obstacle avoidance
      operation being tracked
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Tracking
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = ...;

      std::chrono::microseconds duration(1500);

      manager->TrackPerformance(duration, "Pathfinding");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Multiple Operations
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = ...;

      manager->TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(2300), "CollisionCheck");

      manager->TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(850), "MovementAdjustment");

      manager->TrackPerformance(std::chrono::microseconds(1200), "PathSmoothing");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the AI subsystem during
    obstacle avoidance processing. The performance data is typically stored internally
    for later analysis or reporting. It's important to note that this method does
    not directly affect gameplay mechanics, but rather provides diagnostic information
    for developers and system administrators.
  warnings: Calling this method with extremely large duration values may skew performance
    statistics. Ensure that timing measurements are accurate and consistent when using
    this method for performance monitoring.
