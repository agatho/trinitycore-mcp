  method: ReleaseScriptContext
  signature: void ScriptMgr::ReleaseScriptContext(const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Releases a script context identified by the given string identifier.
  description: The ReleaseScriptContext method is responsible for cleaning up and
    releasing resources associated with a specific script context within the TrinityCore
    scripting system. This method ensures that any memory or references tied to the
    provided context identifier are properly deallocated, preventing memory leaks
    and maintaining system stability. The context identifier typically corresponds
    to a script or module that was previously initialized using the ScriptMgr's initialization
    mechanisms. This method is crucial for proper resource management in dynamic script
    environments where scripts may be loaded, executed, and unloaded during runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: context
    description: A string identifier representing the script context to be released.
      This identifier should match a previously registered or initialized context
      within the ScriptMgr system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Context Release
    code: ScriptMgr::Instance()->ReleaseScriptContext("MyCustomScript");
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Context Release
    code: "if (scriptContextExists)\n{\n    ScriptMgr::Instance()->ReleaseScriptContext(\"\
      PlayerQuestHandler\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called with valid context identifiers that were
    previously registered. Improper use may lead to undefined behavior or resource
    leaks. The method is typically invoked during script unloading or system shutdown
    procedures.
  warnings: Calling ReleaseScriptContext with an invalid or non-existent context identifier
    may result in undefined behavior. Always ensure the context exists before attempting
    to release it. This method should not be called concurrently with other ScriptMgr
    operations without proper synchronization.
