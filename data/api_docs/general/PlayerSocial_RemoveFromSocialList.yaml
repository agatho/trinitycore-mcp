  class: PlayerSocial
  method: RemoveFromSocialList
  signature: void PlayerSocial::RemoveFromSocialList(const int & guid, SocialFlag
    flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the social list with the specified GUID and social
    flag.
  description: The RemoveFromSocialList method removes a player identified by their
    GUID from the social list of the current player, based on the provided SocialFlag.
    This operation affects the player's relationship status in the game's social system,
    such as removing friends or ignoring players. The method modifies the internal
    social list data structure and ensures that the specified player is no longer
    present in the corresponding social category. It does not validate whether the
    GUID corresponds to an actual online player, but rather removes the entry from
    the local social list database.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be removed from
      the social list. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from game objects
      or player data.
  - name: flag
    description: The SocialFlag indicating which category the player should be removed
      from. Valid flags include SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND, SOCIAL_FLAG_IGNORE, etc., depending
      on the current social system implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a friend from social list
    code: 'PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();

      uint32 friendGuid = 12345;

      SocialFlag flag = SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND;

      social->RemoveFromSocialList(friendGuid, flag);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove an ignored player from social list
    code: 'PlayerSocial* social = player->GetSocial();

      uint32 ignoreGuid = 67890;

      SocialFlag flag = SOCIAL_FLAG_IGNORE;

      social->RemoveFromSocialList(ignoreGuid, flag);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the local player's social list and does not directly
    communicate with the server or other players. Changes made using this method are
    only reflected locally until the next synchronization with the server. The method
    assumes that the provided GUID and SocialFlag are valid, and no validation is
    performed internally.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID or flag may result in undefined
    behavior or corruption of internal data structures. Ensure that the GUID corresponds
    to a known player and that the SocialFlag is one of the supported values before
    invoking this method.
