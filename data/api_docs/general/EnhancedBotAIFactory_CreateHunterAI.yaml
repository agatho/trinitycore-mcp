documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new hunter AI for the specified bot player
  description: The CreateHunterAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a specialized AI behavior for a hunter-class bot player within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method sets up the necessary AI components, including combat strategies,
    pet management, and spell usage tailored specifically for hunter characters. It
    ensures that the bot player can effectively engage in gameplay as a hunter, utilizing
    appropriate abilities and tactics based on the current game state and environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player reference,
    insufficient resources, or AI system limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hunter AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = factory->CreateHunterAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created for the hunter bot\n    printf(\"Hunter AI created successfully\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to create Hunter\
      \ AI, error code: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system and assumes that the Player
    object passed in has been properly initialized as a bot with appropriate hunter
    class settings. The method may internally perform checks to ensure the player
    is eligible for hunter AI assignment.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-bot player or a player without proper hunter
    class initialization may result in undefined behavior or system errors. Ensure
    that the Player object is valid and properly configured before invoking this method.
