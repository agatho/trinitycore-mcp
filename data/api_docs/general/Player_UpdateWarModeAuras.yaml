documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's war mode auras based on current combat state and faction
    status.
  description: The UpdateWarModeAuras method manages the application and removal of
    war mode auras for a player character. This function is typically invoked when
    there are changes in the player's combat state, faction standing, or when entering/exiting
    war mode. It ensures that appropriate visual and gameplay effects are applied
    to the player based on their current war mode status. The method checks various
    conditions such as PvP flag status, faction reputation, and server settings to
    determine which auras should be active or removed from the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void SomeCombatHandler(Player* player)\n{\n    // When player enters combat\n\
      \    player->UpdateWarModeAuras();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering War Mode Update
    code: "void OnPlayerPVPKill(Player* player)\n{\n    // After a PvP kill, update\
      \ war mode auras\n    player->UpdateWarModeAuras();\n    // Additional logic\
      \ for PVP tracking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the core when relevant events occur.
    Developers should not typically call this method directly unless implementing
    custom war mode behavior. The function performs aura management through the TrinityCore's
    aura system and may trigger client-side updates for visual effects.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in tight loops or high-frequency scenarios as
    it may cause performance issues due to aura recalculations. Ensure that any custom
    implementations respect existing war mode conditions to prevent conflicts with
    core PvP mechanics.
