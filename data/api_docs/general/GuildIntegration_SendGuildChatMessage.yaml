  signature: void GuildIntegration::SendGuildChatMessage(int * player, const std::string
    & message)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat message to all members of a guild.
  description: The SendGuildChatMessage method broadcasts a specified text message
    to all online guild members. This function is typically used by game systems or
    scripts to communicate important information, announcements, or notifications
    to the entire guild. The method handles the internal logic for routing the message
    through the TrinityCore chat system and ensures that only players who are currently
    in the guild receive the message. It does not validate the sender's permissions
    beyond ensuring they are part of a valid guild.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is sending the message. This value must correspond to a valid online
      player in the game world.
  - name: message
    description: A constant reference to a std::string containing the chat message
      to be sent. The string should not exceed the maximum allowed length for guild
      chat messages, typically 255 characters.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Chat Message
    code: 'int playerGuid = 12345;

      std::string msg = "Welcome to our guild!";

      GuildIntegration::SendGuildChatMessage(&playerGuid, msg);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Dynamic Message with Player Name
    code: 'int playerGuid = 12345;

      std::string playerName = "PlayerName";

      std::string msg = "Welcome " + playerName + " to the guild!";

      GuildIntegration::SendGuildChatMessage(&playerGuid, msg);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player pointer refers to a valid guild member.
    It does not perform any permission checks or validate whether the sender is actually
    in a guild. The message will be sent regardless of the sender's current guild
    status, though it may silently fail if the player is not part of a guild.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an online
    player; otherwise, the method may behave unpredictably or cause errors. Also,
    be cautious about sending messages with excessive length as they might be truncated
    or rejected by the server.
