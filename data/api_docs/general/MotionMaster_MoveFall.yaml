  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveFall
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveFall(uint32 id, int param1)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a falling movement for a creature or unit with specified ID and
    parameter.
  description: The MoveFall method begins a falling animation or movement behavior
    for a unit within the TrinityCore framework. It is typically used to simulate
    gravity-based movement, such as when a creature falls from a height or jumps.
    The 'id' parameter identifies the specific motion type or sequence to be executed,
    while 'param1' can be used to pass additional configuration data like fall distance
    or speed. This method integrates with the unit's AI and movement system to ensure
    proper animation and physics handling during the fall.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the falling motion type or sequence. Used to
      distinguish between different fall behaviors (e.g., normal fall, death fall,
      etc.).
  - name: param1
    description: Additional parameter that can define properties of the fall such
      as distance, speed, or duration. The exact meaning depends on the motion type
      referenced by 'id'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Fall Movement
    code: motionMaster->MoveFall(1, 5); // Initiates a fall motion with ID 1 and parameter
      5 (e.g., fall distance)
    language: cpp
  - title: Death Fall Animation
    code: unit->GetMotionMaster()->MoveFall(2, 0); // Triggers a death-related fall
      animation
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on units that support falling motion types.
    The actual implementation relies on the motion type definitions within the AI
    system and may involve physics calculations depending on how the motion is handled
    internally.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the unit's motion
    state or if the specified 'id' does not correspond to a valid motion type can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the motion type ID is valid
    before calling.
