documentation:
  brief: Performs area-of-effect healing for the restoration shaman's group members
  description: The HandleAoEHealing method executes the core logic for applying area-of-effect
    healing to nearby group members within the shaman's range. This method is typically
    invoked during spell casting or ability usage to distribute healing effects across
    multiple targets simultaneously. It evaluates the current group composition, checks
    for valid healing targets, and applies appropriate healing amounts based on the
    shaman's spell power and any relevant buffs or debuffs. The method ensures that
    only group members within the specified range receive the healing effect, maintaining
    proper targeting mechanics and avoiding over-healing of already full health targets.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group members should receive
      the AOE healing effect. This parameter determines the scope of the healing application
      and typically corresponds to the player's current group or raid instance.
  returns: Returns true if the AOE healing was successfully applied to at least one
    target, false otherwise. The method returns false when no valid targets are found
    within range or when all targets are already at full health.
  examples:
  - title: Basic AOE Healing Usage
    code: "if (shaman->HandleAoEHealing(player->GetGroup()->GetId())) {\n    // Healing\
      \ applied successfully\n    SendChatMessage(\"Healing applied to group members!\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // No targets found or healing failed\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      No valid targets for healing.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AOE Healing with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 groupId = player->GetGroup() ? player->GetGroup()->GetId() : 0;\n\
      if (groupId > 0) {\n    bool success = shaman->HandleAoEHealing(groupId);\n\
      \    if (!success) {\n        // Log healing failure\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      AOE Healing failed for group %u\", groupId);\n    }\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Player not in a valid group\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the shaman's current group membership and healing spell
    configuration. The healing amount is calculated based on the shaman's spell power,
    target health percentages, and any active healing modifiers. Performance considerations
    include checking all group members within range for valid targets, so large groups
    may impact execution time during high-frequency healing events.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter corresponds to a valid group instance
    before calling this method, as invalid group IDs can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The method does not validate whether the player is in combat or has
    sufficient mana; these checks should be performed externally.
