api:
  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: RecordCombatOutcome
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::RecordCombatOutcome(Player * player, BotAI *
    bot, bool playerWon, float duration)
documentation:
  brief: Records the outcome of a combat encounter between a player and a bot AI,
    including win/loss status and duration.
  description: The RecordCombatOutcome method is used to log the results of a combat
    interaction within the AdaptiveDifficulty system. It takes in a pointer to the
    player involved, a pointer to the BotAI instance that was engaged, and details
    about whether the player won the encounter along with how long it lasted. This
    information is crucial for the adaptive difficulty algorithm to adjust challenge
    levels dynamically based on performance data. The method does not return any value
    but updates internal tracking structures used by the system to determine future
    difficulty scaling.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the human player involved
      in the combat encounter.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object that was engaged in combat with the player.
  - name: playerWon
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player won the combat encounter
      (true) or lost (false).
  - name: duration
    description: Float value representing the duration of the combat encounter in
      seconds.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: AdaptiveDifficulty::RecordCombatOutcome(player, bot, true, 45.3f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording a loss with duration
    code: AdaptiveDifficulty::RecordCombatOutcome(player, bot, false, 62.7f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called at the end of a combat encounter to update
    internal statistics used by the AdaptiveDifficulty system for adjusting difficulty
    scaling. It's important that all parameters are valid pointers and duration is
    a positive value.
  warnings: Ensure that player and bot pointers are not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause undefined behavior. Also, make sure
    that the duration parameter represents actual combat time in seconds for accurate
    difficulty adjustments.
