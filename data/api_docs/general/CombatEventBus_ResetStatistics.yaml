  method: ResetStatistics
  signature: void CombatEventBus::ResetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all combat statistics tracked by the CombatEventBus to their initial
    state.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears all accumulated combat-related metrics
    and counters within the CombatEventBus instance. This includes resetting damage
    dealt, healing done, kills, deaths, and other combat event tracking data. The
    method is typically invoked during combat session resets, player logout, or when
    starting a new encounter to ensure clean statistics for subsequent events. It
    does not affect active combat state or ongoing events, but rather prepares the
    bus for new statistical tracking.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Combat Statistics at Player Logout
    code: "void OnPlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    CombatEventBus::GetInstance()->ResetStatistics();\n\
      \    // All combat stats are now cleared for the next login\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Statistics Before New Encounter
    code: "void StartNewEncounter()\n{\n    // Reset previous encounter statistics\n\
      \    CombatEventBus::GetInstance()->ResetStatistics();\n    \n    // Begin new\
      \ combat tracking session\n    StartCombatTracking();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it permanently clears all accumulated
    combat data. It's recommended to call this only when starting a fresh combat session
    or when statistics are no longer needed. The method is thread-safe and can be
    safely invoked from any thread context.
  warnings: Calling ResetStatistics during active combat events may result in loss
    of important statistical data that could be needed for achievement tracking, PvP
    rankings, or raid progress logging. Always ensure the combat session is properly
    concluded before resetting statistics.
