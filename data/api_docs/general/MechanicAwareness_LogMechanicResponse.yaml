  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: LogMechanicResponse
  signature: void MechanicAwareness::LogMechanicResponse(Player * bot, const MechanicInfo
    & mechanic, MechanicResponse response)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a mechanic response for a bot player within the MechanicAwareness system.
  description: The LogMechanicResponse method records the outcome of a mechanic interaction
    for a specified bot player. This function is typically used in AI-driven gameplay
    logic to track how bots respond to various game mechanics such as stuns, roots,
    silences, or other debuffs. It allows the system to maintain awareness of mechanic
    effectiveness and player behavior patterns. The method accepts a pointer to the
    bot player, information about the mechanic applied, and the resulting response
    from that mechanic. This logging mechanism supports decision-making processes
    in AI scripts by providing historical data on mechanic interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the mechanic
      response is being logged. Must not be null.
  - name: mechanic
    description: Reference to a MechanicInfo structure containing details about the
      mechanic that was applied or encountered. Includes type, duration, and other
      relevant properties of the mechanic.
  - name: response
    description: Enumeration value indicating the outcome or reaction of the bot to
      the mechanic. Values typically represent success, failure, immunity, or evasion
      states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Logging of Mechanic Response
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...;

      MechanicInfo mechInfo = {Mechanics::STUN, 5.0f};

      MechanicResponse response = MechanicResponse::SUCCESS;

      mechanicAwareness.LogMechanicResponse(myBot, mechInfo, response);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Different Response Types
    code: 'Player* bot = ...;

      MechanicInfo slowMechanic = {Mechanics::SLOW, 3.0f};


      // Log successful application of a slow mechanic

      mechanicAwareness.LogMechanicResponse(bot, slowMechanic, MechanicResponse::SUCCESS);


      // Log that the mechanic was resisted

      mechanicAwareness.LogMechanicResponse(bot, slowMechanic, MechanicResponse::RESISTED);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger AI awareness system and should be called
    whenever a bot interacts with or is affected by a mechanic. It does not directly
    affect gameplay but contributes to internal tracking and decision-making algorithms.
    The MechanicInfo structure must contain valid data; otherwise, behavior may be
    undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and points to an actual
    bot instance. Passing a null pointer or an invalid player object can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Also, make sure the MechanicResponse enum values are correctly
    mapped to avoid misinterpretation of mechanic outcomes.
