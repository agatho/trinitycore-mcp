  method: HandleMoveSetModMovementForceMagnitudeAck
  signature: void WorldSession::HandleMoveSetModMovementForceMagnitudeAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MovementSpeedAck
    & setModMovementForceMagnitudeAck)
documentation:
  brief: Processes acknowledgment of a movement force magnitude change packet from
    the client.
  description: The HandleMoveSetModMovementForceMagnitudeAck method handles incoming
    acknowledgment packets from the client that confirm receipt of a movement force
    magnitude modification. This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling
    system and is typically invoked when the server sends a MovementSpeedAck packet
    to the client with information about modified movement forces, such as those caused
    by spells or environmental effects. The method processes this acknowledgment to
    ensure proper synchronization of movement states between the client and server.
  parameters:
  - name: setModMovementForceMagnitudeAck
    description: A reference to a MovementSpeedAck packet containing the acknowledgment
      data for a modified movement force magnitude. This packet includes information
      about the movement speed change that was applied to the player's character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Acknowledgment Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveSetModMovementForceMagnitudeAck(WorldPackets::Movement::MovementSpeedAck&\
      \ setModMovementForceMagnitudeAck)\n{\n    // Process the acknowledgment of\
      \ movement force magnitude change\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n \
      \   {\n        // Update player's movement state based on acknowledgment\n \
      \       player->UpdateMovementForce();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the movement synchronization system
    in TrinityCore. It ensures that client-side movement modifications are properly
    acknowledged and synchronized with server-side state. The method does not directly
    modify player movement but processes acknowledgments for previously sent movement
    updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of this acknowledgment may lead to desynchronization
    between client and server movement states, potentially causing issues like character
    teleportation or incorrect movement behavior. Ensure that all related movement
    packets are properly handled before calling this method.
