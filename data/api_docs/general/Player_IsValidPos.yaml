documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given bag and slot combination represents a valid position
    in the player's inventory.
  description: The IsValidPos method determines if a specified bag and slot combination
    is valid for use within the player's inventory system. It verifies that the bag
    and slot values fall within acceptable ranges, ensuring they correspond to a real
    location in the player's backpack or bank. This method is crucial for validating
    item placements and preventing invalid operations when interacting with the inventory
    system. The method accounts for both explicit positions (where the bag and slot
    are explicitly specified) and implicit positions (where the method checks against
    valid ranges without specific parameters).
  parameters:
  - name: bag
    description: The bag identifier to validate. This represents the bag number, typically
      ranging from 0 to 11 for backpack slots, with 0 representing the main backpack
      and 11 representing the bank bag.
  - name: slot
    description: The slot within the bag to validate. This represents the specific
      slot number within a bag, ranging from 0 to 36 (for backpack) or 0 to 72 (for
      bank). Valid slots are those that correspond to actual item slots in the player's
      inventory.
  - name: explicit_pos
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the validation should consider
      explicit positions. When true, the method validates against specific bag/slot
      combinations; when false, it checks if the position is valid within the context
      of the player's inventory system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bag and slot combination represents a valid
    position in the player's inventory, false otherwise. The method returns false
    for invalid combinations such as negative bag numbers or slots beyond the valid
    range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation example
    code: "if (player->IsValidPos(0, 0)) {\n    // Valid position\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with bank validation
    code: "if (player->IsValidPos(11, 5)) {\n    // Valid bank position\n}\n// Check\
      \ if the position is valid for explicit bag/slot combinations"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in inventory-related operations and is essential
    for preventing invalid item placements. It performs validation checks based on
    the player's inventory structure, including both backpack and bank slots. The
    method does not validate against actual item contents but rather validates the
    position itself.
  warnings: The method should be used carefully when dealing with bank positions as
    it may return false for valid bank slots if the player doesn't have access to
    that bank slot. Additionally, this method does not account for item restrictions
    or requirements such as level requirements or class restrictions.
