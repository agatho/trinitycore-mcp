  class: BotActionProcessor
  method: ExecuteAction
  signature: BotActionResult BotActionProcessor::ExecuteAction(const BotAction & action)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a bot action and returns the result of that execution.
  description: The ExecuteAction method processes a given BotAction object within
    the context of the TrinityCore AI system. It evaluates the action's parameters,
    performs the necessary game logic operations such as movement, targeting, or spell
    casting, and returns a BotActionResult indicating success, failure, or other status
    codes. This method is typically invoked by the bot's decision-making loop to carry
    out specific behaviors. The method may interact with the player's current state,
    target information, and available resources to determine how to execute the action
    effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BotActionResult object that indicates the outcome of executing the action.
    Possible values include success flags, failure codes, or status indicators such
    as 'completed', 'failed', or 'pending'. The result can be used by the calling
    code to determine if further actions should be taken.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Execution
    code: "BotAction action;\naction.type = BotActionType::MOVE_TO_TARGET;\naction.targetGuid\
      \ = playerGuid;\nBotActionResult result = processor.ExecuteAction(action);\n\
      if (result.success) {\n    // Action completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI processing pipeline and should be called
    from within a thread-safe context. The action object passed in must be properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling ExecuteAction with an uninitialized or malformed BotAction may
    lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Ensure all required fields are populated
    before invoking the method.
