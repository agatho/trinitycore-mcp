documentation:
  brief: Updates the tracking state and behavior of the survival hunter AI.
  description: The UpdateTracking method is responsible for managing the tracking
    mechanics of a Survival Hunter AI in TrinityCore. This method typically handles
    the logic for updating target tracking, including checking if a target is valid,
    maintaining awareness of enemy positions, and potentially triggering tracking-related
    abilities or behaviors. It's part of the core AI update loop and ensures that
    the hunter maintains appropriate tracking state based on game conditions and AI
    decision-making.

  - title: Basic UpdateTracking Call
    code: "void UpdateTracking()\n{\n    // Called every AI update cycle\n    if (m_target\
      \ && m_target->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Update tracking logic here\n  \
      \      m_ai->UpdateTracking();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the AI update cycle and should
    not be called manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The method likely
    interacts with internal tracking state variables and may trigger other AI actions
    based on tracking updates.
