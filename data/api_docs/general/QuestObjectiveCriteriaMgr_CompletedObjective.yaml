  class: QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
  method: CompletedObjective
  signature: void QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr::CompletedObjective(const int * questObjective,
    int * referencePlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a quest objective as completed for the specified player
  description: The CompletedObjective method is used to notify the QuestObjectiveCriteriaMgr
    that a specific quest objective has been completed by a player. This method updates
    internal tracking structures to reflect the completion status of the objective,
    which may trigger further quest progression or reward distribution. The method
    takes a pointer to a quest objective identifier and a reference to the player
    who completed it. It is typically called internally by the core quest system when
    a player meets the criteria for completing a quest objective.
  parameters:
  - name: questObjective
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest objective ID that has
      been completed. This identifier corresponds to a specific objective within a
      quest.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who has completed the quest objective. Used to track progress for the
      specific player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int objectiveId = 12345;

      int playerId = 67890;

      questObjectiveCriteriaMgr->CompletedObjective(&objectiveId, &playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest progression system and should not
    be called directly from external modules unless implementing custom quest logic.
    The method likely updates internal data structures such as player quest progress
    tracking or objective completion flags.
  warnings: Ensure that the questObjective ID and player ID are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or corruption of quest
    progress data.
