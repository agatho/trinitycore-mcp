  class: Unit
  method: IsMagnet
  signature: bool Unit::IsMagnet() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is under magnet effect, returning true if the unit is
    currently affected by a magnet spell.
  description: The IsMagnet method determines whether a unit is currently under the
    influence of a magnet spell, which typically occurs when a unit is being pulled
    or attracted toward a specific target. This method is commonly used in combat
    and movement mechanics to verify if a unit's position is being controlled by an
    external force. The method returns true when the unit is actively affected by
    a magnet effect, such as those caused by spells like 'Magnet' or similar mechanics
    that pull units towards a target. It does not distinguish between different types
    of magnet effects but simply indicates whether the unit is under any magnet influence.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently affected by a magnet effect, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the unit's position is being controlled by an external
    force, such as a pull or attraction from a spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsMagnet())\n{\n    // Unit is under magnet effect\n    // Do\
      \ something with the unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement or combat
    related methods to determine if a unit's behavior is being controlled by external
    forces. It may be called frequently during gameplay, especially when dealing with
    spell effects that involve pulling or attracting units.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with other similar methods such as
    IsInCombat or IsRooted, as it specifically relates to magnet effects and not general
    movement control or combat status.
