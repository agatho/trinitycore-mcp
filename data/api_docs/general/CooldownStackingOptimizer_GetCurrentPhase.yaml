  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: GetCurrentPhase
  signature: BossPhase CooldownStackingOptimizer::GetCurrentPhase() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current boss phase state managed by the cooldown stacking optimizer.
  description: The GetCurrentPhase method returns the active BossPhase enum value
    that represents the current phase of a boss encounter being handled by the CooldownStackingOptimizer.
    This phase typically indicates which set of abilities or cooldowns are currently
    relevant or active for the boss. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational, allowing other systems to query the current phase
    without side effects. It's commonly used in conjunction with phase-based cooldown
    management logic within TrinityCore's AI and encounter systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A BossPhase enum value indicating the current phase of the boss encounter.
    Possible values may include PHASE_NORMAL, PHASE_ENRAGE, or other phase-specific
    constants depending on the boss implementation and encounter mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Current Phase
    code: "BossPhase currentPhase = optimizer.GetCurrentPhase();\nif (currentPhase\
      \ == PHASE_ENRAGE)\n{\n    // Handle enrage-specific cooldown logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Phase to Determine Ability Eligibility
    code: "CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;\nBossPhase phase = optimizer.GetCurrentPhase();\n\
      switch (phase)\n{\n    case PHASE_NORMAL:\n        // Allow normal abilities\n\
      \        break;\n    case PHASE_ENRAGE:\n        // Restrict or modify ability\
      \ usage\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads internal state without modification.
    It's designed to be called frequently during encounter updates, so performance
    should not be a concern for typical usage patterns.
