documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a mount entry by its unique identifier from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetMountById method fetches a MountEntry object corresponding to
    the specified mount ID from the TrinityCore database. This function is used to
    access detailed information about a specific mount, such as its display ID, speed,
    and other properties. The method performs a lookup in an internal cache or database
    structure that stores all available mount data. It's commonly used during gameplay
    when checking if a player can use a particular mount or retrieving visual and
    mechanical attributes for mount-related UI elements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const MountEntry object if the mount ID exists in the database;
    otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching mount entry is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const MountEntry* mount = sDB2Manager->GetMountById(12345);\nif (mount)\n\
      {\n    // Use mount data\n    uint32 displayId = mount->DisplayID;\n    // ...\
      \ process mount information\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Mount Availability
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nconst MountEntry* mount\
      \ = sDB2Manager->GetMountById(98765);\nif (mount && player->HasSpell(mount->SpellId))\n\
      {\n    // Player can use this mount\n    player->SendMountDisplayInfo(playerId,\
      \ mount->DisplayID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses cached DB2 data which is loaded at server startup. The
    returned pointer remains valid for the lifetime of the application and should
    not be modified. Performance is optimized through internal hash maps or similar
    structures, making repeated lookups efficient.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value means the mount is usable by
    the player; additional checks such as spell availability or player requirements
    must be performed separately.
