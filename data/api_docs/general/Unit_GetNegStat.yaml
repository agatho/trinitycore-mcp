  signature: float Unit::GetNegStat(int stat) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the negative stat value for a specified stat index.
  description: The GetNegStat method retrieves the negative stat value associated
    with a given stat index from a Unit object. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to access stat-related data for player characters
    or NPCs. The function returns a float value representing the negative stat, which
    may be zero or negative depending on the stat type and current state of the unit.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other stat-related methods to calculate
    overall stat modifiers or to determine the effectiveness of certain abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the negative stat for the specified
    stat index. The value can be zero or negative, depending on the stat type and
    unit's current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float negStat = unit->GetNegStat(STAT_STRENGTH);\nif (negStat < 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle negative stat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Unit class and likely involves internal stat calculations.
    Performance considerations may arise when used frequently in combat or during
    stat updates. Thread safety depends on how the unit object is accessed, as it's
    typically not thread-safe without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method with stat indices that might
    not exist or have been modified. The return value may be zero if no negative stat
    exists for the given stat index, and improper handling could lead to incorrect
    calculations in combat mechanics.
