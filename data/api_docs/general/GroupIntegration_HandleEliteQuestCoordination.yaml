  class: GroupIntegration
  method: HandleEliteQuestCoordination
  signature: void GroupIntegration::HandleEliteQuestCoordination(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates elite quest participation for group members within a World of
    Warcraft TrinityCore instance.
  description: The HandleEliteQuestCoordination method manages the distribution and
    synchronization of elite quest data among group members in a TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft server. This method ensures that all players within a specified
    group receive appropriate quest updates, tracking, and rewards related to elite
    quests. It handles the coordination of quest states, objectives, and progress
    across multiple players, maintaining consistency in quest completion and reward
    distribution. The method likely integrates with the existing group management
    and quest system components to provide seamless multiplayer quest experiences
    for elite content.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group that will
      participate in the elite quest coordination. Must be a valid group instance
      with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier for the elite quest that requires coordination
      among group members. This ID must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Elite Quest Coordination
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    GroupIntegration::HandleEliteQuestCoordination(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Elite Quest Coordination with Error Handling
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    uint32 eliteQuestId = 12345;\n    GroupIntegration::HandleEliteQuestCoordination(group,\
      \ eliteQuestId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where player is not in a valid\
      \ group\n    sLog->outError(\"Player not in valid group for elite quest coordination\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the World of Warcraft quest system to update
    quest states and objectives for all group members. It may involve sending packets
    to clients, updating database records, and managing quest completion conditions
    across multiple players. The implementation should be thread-safe as it's likely
    called from various game systems that may operate concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter is valid and contains at least one member
    before calling this method. Passing an invalid or null group pointer could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, verify that the questId corresponds
    to a legitimate elite quest entry in the database to prevent runtime errors.
