  class: ArcaneChargeTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void ArcaneChargeTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the arcane charge tracking state for the specified player.
  description: The Update method in ArcaneChargeTracker is responsible for managing
    and refreshing the arcane charge state of a player character. This typically involves
    checking the current arcane charge count, updating cooldowns, and ensuring that
    the player's arcane charge status is synchronized with the game's internal state.
    The method likely interacts with the player's spell casting system to maintain
    accurate arcane charge tracking for abilities such as Arcane Blast or other arcane-based
    spells that consume charges. This method is generally called during player updates
    or when arcane charge-related events occur in the game loop.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose arcane charge state needs to be
      updated. This parameter represents the target character for which the arcane
      charge tracking will be refreshed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'ArcaneChargeTracker tracker;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      tracker.Update(player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update During Player Tick
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_arcaneChargeTracker)\n\
      \        m_arcaneChargeTracker->Update(m_player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during player updates to ensure accurate
    arcane charge state. It may internally check for spell cooldowns, aura states,
    and other arcane-related mechanics that affect charge accumulation or consumption.
  warnings: Ensure the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Calling Update with an invalid player reference could lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
