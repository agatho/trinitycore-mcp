  brief: Initializes the War Within mount data for all players in the realm
  description: The InitializeWarWithinMounts method prepares and loads all War Within
    faction-specific mount data into the game system. This method ensures that player
    characters can access their faction-restricted mounts upon login or when the expansion
    content is enabled. It typically handles database synchronization, cache population,
    and internal data structure initialization required for the War Within mount system
    to function correctly. The method should be called during server startup or when
    enabling the War Within expansion feature.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during server initialization or when the
    War Within expansion content is activated. It may perform database queries and
    cache operations that could impact startup time. The method assumes that all necessary
    database tables for War Within mounts are properly set up.
