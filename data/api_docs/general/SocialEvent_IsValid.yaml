  signature: bool SocialEvent::IsValid() const
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the social event data is in a consistent and usable state.
  description: The IsValid method checks if the SocialEvent object contains valid
    data and is in a consistent state for use within the TrinityCore framework. It
    performs internal validation to ensure that required fields are populated, data
    types are correct, and the event adheres to game logic constraints. This method
    is typically used before processing or broadcasting social events to prevent invalid
    operations. The validation includes checking for proper event type, valid participant
    lists, and correct timing information.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the social event is in a valid state and can be safely
    processed; returns false if any validation checks fail or if the event data is
    incomplete or inconsistent.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "SocialEvent event;\n// ... populate event with data ...\nif (event.IsValid())\
      \ {\n    // Process the social event\n    event.Broadcast();\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Handle invalid event\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid social event detected\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Event Handler
    code: "void HandleSocialEventPacket(WorldPacket& data) {\n    SocialEvent event;\n\
      \    // ... deserialize packet into event ...\n    if (!event.IsValid()) {\n\
      \        sLog->outError(\"Received invalid social event from player\");\n  \
      \      return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with valid event processing\n    ProcessValidSocialEvent(event);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs lightweight validation checks and should not be considered
    a comprehensive data integrity check. It's primarily designed to catch obvious
    inconsistencies that would cause runtime errors during event processing. The validation
    logic may evolve with game updates and new social event types.
  warnings: Do not assume that a valid event will remain valid after modifications.
    The IsValid method should be called again after any changes to the event data.
    Additionally, this method does not validate permissions or player eligibility
    - those checks must be performed separately.
