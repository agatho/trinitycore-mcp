documentation:
  brief: Decrements the bot level bracket counter for the specified level and faction.
  description: The DecrementBracket method reduces the count of bots assigned to a
    specific level bracket and faction within the BotLevelDistribution system. This
    function is typically used when a bot is removed or reassigned, ensuring that
    the distribution of bots across different levels and factions remains accurate.
    The method modifies internal tracking data structures to reflect the updated bot
    distribution. It is designed to maintain balance in bot population across various
    game levels and factions for proper gameplay experience.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level bracket of the bots being decremented. Must be a valid
      level value within the supported range of the bot system.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction identifier for which the bot count is decremented. Valid
      values correspond to recognized factions in the game (e.g., Alliance, Horde).

      distribution.DecrementBracket(10, 469); // Decrement bots at level 10 for faction
      469 (Alliance)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters or maps that track how many
    bots exist per level and faction combination. It may be called during bot removal,
    reassignment, or respawn events to maintain accurate distribution statistics.
