documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Holy Paladin has an active secondary beacon.
  description: The HasSecondaryBeacon method checks if a Holy Paladin character currently
    has a secondary beacon active. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    paladins can maintain multiple beacons simultaneously, with one primary and potentially
    one or more secondary beacons. This method returns true if at least one secondary
    beacon is active, and false otherwise. The check typically involves examining
    internal beacon tracking data structures within the HolyPaladinBeaconTracker class
    to determine the status of secondary beacon states.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a secondary beacon is currently active on the Holy Paladin;
    returns false if no secondary beacon is active or if the method cannot determine
    beacon status.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Secondary Beacon Status
    code: "if (paladinBeaconTracker.HasSecondaryBeacon()) {\n    // Handle logic when\
      \ secondary beacon is active\n    printf(\"Secondary beacon is active\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle logic when no secondary beacon is active\n    printf(\"\
      No secondary beacon active\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a simple boolean check against internal beacon
    state flags. It may be called frequently during combat or spell casting, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
