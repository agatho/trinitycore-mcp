  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: NeedToRepair
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::NeedToRepair() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player needs to repair their equipment from an NPC
    interaction.
  description: The NeedToRepair method checks if the player's items require repair
    based on their current condition and the NPC's repair capabilities. This method
    is typically invoked during NPC interaction sessions, particularly when dealing
    with vendors or repair NPCs. It evaluates the durability of the player's equipped
    items and determines if any repairs are necessary or available. The result influences
    whether repair options are presented to the player in the interaction interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one of the player's equipped items requires repair,
    false otherwise. This indicates that the player should be offered repair services
    by the NPC.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->NeedToRepair()) {\n    // Show repair options\
      \ to the player\n    player->SendNPCDialogTextUpdate(npc, REPAIR_DIALOG_TEXT);\n\
      } else {\n    // No repairs needed, proceed with other interactions\n    player->SendNPCDialogTextUpdate(npc,\
      \ NO_REPAIRS_DIALOG_TEXT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely evaluates item durability and compares it against the
    NPC's repair capacity. It may be called frequently during interaction sessions
    to update UI states. The implementation might cache results to avoid redundant
    calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when a valid NPC interaction session
    is active, as calling it outside of such context may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results.
