  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: SetScanPriority
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::SetScanPriority(uint32 npcId, uint32 priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scan priority for a specific NPC ID within the InterruptAwareness
    system.
  description: The SetScanPriority method configures the scanning priority level assigned
    to a particular NPC (Non-Player Character) ID within the InterruptAwareness framework.
    This allows the AI or game logic to prioritize certain NPCs during interrupt checks
    or awareness scans, which can be crucial for managing combat behavior, threat
    detection, or reaction timing in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The method updates an internal mapping between NPC identifiers and their respective
    priority values, influencing how frequently or intensely these NPCs are evaluated
    for potential interrupts or awareness events.
  parameters:
  - name: npcId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the NPC for which to set the scan priority.
      This value must correspond to a valid NPC entry in the game's database.
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level to assign to the specified NPC. Higher values
      typically indicate higher priority for scanning and interrupt evaluation, though
      exact behavior depends on implementation details of the InterruptAwareness system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Scan Priority for a Common Mob
    code: InterruptAwareness::SetScanPriority(12345, 100);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Priority for a Boss NPC
    code: InterruptAwareness::SetScanPriority(98765, 500);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other interrupt or awareness-related
    systems to fine-tune AI behavior. It may affect performance if many NPCs are updated
    frequently, so consider batching updates when possible.
