  class: CriteriaHandler
  method: GetOwnerInfo
  signature: std::string CriteriaHandler::GetOwnerInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns formatted information about the criteria's owner, including player
    name and GUID.
  description: The GetOwnerInfo method retrieves and formats identifying information
    about the owner of a criteria instance. This typically includes the player's name
    and their unique identifier (GUID) within the game world. The method is used primarily
    in achievement tracking and criterion evaluation systems where it's necessary
    to associate criteria progress with specific players. The returned string format
    is designed for logging, debugging, or display purposes, providing clear identification
    of which player's criteria are being referenced. This method does not perform
    any database queries or external lookups; instead, it uses cached or already resolved
    owner information from the criteria handler instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A std::string containing formatted owner information in a human-readable
    format, typically including the player name and GUID, such as ''Player: JohnDoe
    (GUID: 123456789)'''
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Debugging
    code: 'CriteriaHandler* handler = ...;

      std::string ownerInfo = handler->GetOwnerInfo();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("criteria", "Criteria owner: {}", ownerInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Owner Info in Achievement Logging
    code: "void LogCriteriaProgress(CriteriaHandler* handler) {\n    std::string info\
      \ = handler->GetOwnerInfo();\n    if (!info.empty()) {\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      criteria\", \"Player {} completed criteria\", info);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the CriteriaHandler instance has valid owner information
    already set. The returned string format may vary depending on whether the owner
    is a player, creature, or game object. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight
    operation as it only returns pre-computed data without any I/O operations.
  warnings: The method will return an empty string if no owner information has been
    set or if the owner is invalid. Always check the return value before using it
    in critical logging or display scenarios to avoid unexpected behavior.
