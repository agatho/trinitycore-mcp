documentation:
  brief: Moves a loot item from one container to another, transferring ownership of
    the item's data.
  description: The LootItem::LootItem method is a move constructor that transfers
    the contents of a source LootItem object to the current instance. This operation
    is typically used when moving loot items between different containers or contexts
    within the TrinityCore loot system. The method ensures efficient resource management
    by avoiding unnecessary copying of item data, instead transferring ownership of
    the underlying resources. It's commonly employed during loot distribution processes
    where items need to be relocated from temporary storage to player inventory or
    other loot containers.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another LootItem object whose contents will
      be moved into this instance. This parameter represents the source loot item
      being transferred.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving a Loot Item to New Container
    code: 'LootItem newLoot;

      LootItem oldLoot;

      // ... populate oldLoot with data ...

      newLoot = std::move(oldLoot); // Uses the move constructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loot Distribution in TrinityCore
    code: "void DistributeLoot(Player* player, LootItem& lootItem) {\n    LootItem\
      \ playerLoot;\n    playerLoot = std::move(lootItem); // Transfer item to player's\
      \ loot\n    // Process the moved loot item for player distribution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is crucial for performance in
    loot handling systems. After a move operation, the source LootItem object should
    not be used as its contents have been transferred. The implementation assumes
    that the moved item's data is valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Using this method on an already moved-from LootItem can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the source object is not accessed after a move operation.
    This constructor does not perform any validation of the source item's state, so
    developers must ensure proper usage patterns.
