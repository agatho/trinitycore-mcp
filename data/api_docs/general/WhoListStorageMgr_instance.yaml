documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the WhoListStorageMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the WhoListStorageMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This manager is responsible for storing and managing player 'who' list
    data, which is used by the game's who command to display online players matching
    specific criteria. The method performs lazy initialization, creating the instance
    on first call if it does not already exist. It is thread-safe and designed to
    be called from any part of the TrinityCore codebase where access to the who list
    storage is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of WhoListStorageMgr. The returned
    pointer is never null as the singleton ensures its own existence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'WhoListStorageMgr* whoMgr = WhoListStorageMgr::instance();

      // Use whoMgr to access who list storage functionality'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Stored Data
    code: 'WhoListStorageMgr* mgr = WhoListStorageMgr::instance();

      // Example of using the instance to retrieve or modify who list data

      WorldPacket data = mgr->GetWhoListData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton pattern conventions. The instance
    is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application. As
    a singleton, it should be used carefully to avoid tight coupling in code design.
