  method: GetItemTargetEntry
  signature: uint32 SpellCastTargets::GetItemTargetEntry() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entry ID of the item target associated with the spell cast.
  description: The GetItemTargetEntry method returns the unique identifier (entry)
    of the item target that was specified during a spell cast operation. This entry
    typically corresponds to the ItemTemplate entry in the database, which defines
    properties such as item type, stats, and behavior. The method is used primarily
    when a spell targets a specific item, such as enchanting an item or using an item
    with a spell effect. It's important to note that this method should only be called
    when the spell cast targets an item; otherwise, it may return an invalid or zero
    value. This method does not perform any validation on whether the target item
    is valid or exists in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the entry ID of the targeted item. If no
    item target was specified during the spell cast, this method returns 0, indicating
    an invalid or missing item target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Item Target Entry
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// Assume targets has been properly initialized\
      \ with an item target\nuint32 itemEntry = targets.GetItemTargetEntry();\nif\
      \ (itemEntry != 0)\n{\n    // Process the item entry\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Item target entry: %u\", itemEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Item Target Entry to Validate Item Type
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\nuint32 entry = targets.GetItemTargetEntry();\n\
      if (entry != 0)\n{\n    ItemTemplate const* proto = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(entry);\n\
      \    if (proto && proto->Class == ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON)\n    {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with weapon-specific spell logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SpellCastTargets class and is typically used in
    conjunction with spell effects that require item targeting. The returned entry
    ID can be used to fetch detailed item information from the ItemTemplate database
    table. It's recommended to validate the returned entry before using it, especially
    if the spell may target different types of items.
  warnings: This method returns 0 when no valid item target is set, which can lead
    to incorrect behavior if not checked. Developers should always verify that the
    returned value is non-zero before using it in item-related operations. Additionally,
    this method assumes that the targets object has been properly initialized with
    an item target.
