  signature: void InsanityResource::InsanityResource()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new InsanityResource object with default values.
  description: The InsanityResource constructor initializes a new instance of the
    InsanityResource class. This method sets up the internal state of the resource,
    typically configuring default values for insanity-related properties such as current
    value, maximum value, and any associated timers or flags. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this class likely represents a resource system
    specific to certain classes or abilities that consume insanity, such as Shadow
    Priest's Insanity mechanic or similar gameplay elements. The constructor ensures
    that the object is in a valid state upon creation and ready for use in game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InsanityResource instance
    code: 'InsanityResource insanityResource;

      // The object is now initialized with default values

      // Ready to be used in gameplay mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new InsanityResource
    object on the stack or heap. Developers should ensure that any derived classes
    properly call the base class constructor if inheritance is used. The initialization
    process may involve setting up internal data structures, default values, and potentially
    registering with game systems.
