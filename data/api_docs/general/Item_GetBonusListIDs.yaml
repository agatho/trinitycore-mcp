  signature: const int & Item::GetBonusListIDs() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the bonus list IDs associated with the item.
  description: This method retrieves the bonus list IDs that are applied to the item,
    which determine how bonuses are distributed and calculated. The returned IDs are
    used for various game mechanics including enchantment calculations, gem socketing,
    and item level scaling. This method is essential for understanding item properties
    and their associated bonuses in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to an array of integers representing the bonus
    list IDs associated with this item. Each ID corresponds to a specific bonus type
    or effect that can be applied to the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);\nconst int& bonusListIDs = item->GetBonusListIDs();\n\
      for (int id : bonusListIDs)\n{\n    // Process each bonus list ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and should be used in any context where item bonuses
    need to be processed. Performance considerations are minimal as this method simply
    returns a reference to an internal data structure.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying the returned array, as changes may affect
    item bonus calculations. This method should not be used for direct modification
    of item properties.
