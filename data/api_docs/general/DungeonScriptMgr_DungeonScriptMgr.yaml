documentation:
  brief: Copies the contents of another DungeonScriptMgr instance to this instance.
  description: The DungeonScriptMgr copy constructor initializes a new DungeonScriptMgr
    object by copying all data members from an existing DungeonScriptMgr instance.
    This method is typically used when creating a new dungeon script manager that
    should have identical configuration and state as an existing one. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this would be relevant for managing
    dungeon-specific scripts and their associated data during dungeon creation or
    duplication scenarios. The copy constructor ensures that all internal mappings,
    script references, and configuration data are properly duplicated to maintain
    consistency across dungeon instances.

  examples:
  - title: Copying a DungeonScriptMgr Instance
    code: 'DungeonScriptMgr originalManager;

      // ... configure originalManager ...

      DungeonScriptMgr newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage

      // newManager now contains identical data to originalManager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. It performs a shallow
    copy of all member variables, which means that if any members are pointers, they
    will point to the same memory locations as the source object. Developers should
    be aware of potential shared state issues when working with pointer-based data
    members.
