  signature: bool PathfindingAdapter::IsWalkablePosition(Map * map, const int & position)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position on a map is walkable for pathfinding purposes.
  description: The IsWalkablePosition method determines whether a specified position
    within a given map is traversable by units for navigation and pathfinding calculations.
    This method evaluates the terrain, obstacles, and other environmental factors
    to assess walkability. It is commonly used during AI movement planning to ensure
    that characters do not attempt to move through invalid or blocked locations. The
    method requires a valid Map object and a position coordinate to perform its evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the position is located. Must be
      a valid, initialized map instance.
  - name: position
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position coordinate to check.
      Typically corresponds to a grid cell or coordinate value within the map's spatial
      system.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is walkable, false otherwise. A
    return value of false indicates that the position is either blocked, obstructed,
    or otherwise unsuitable for unit movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Map* myMap = ...; // Assume valid map instance\nint testPosition = 12345;\n\
      bool isWalkable = pathfindingAdapter.IsWalkablePosition(myMap, testPosition);\n\
      if (isWalkable) {\n    // Proceed with movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Pathfinding
    code: "class MyAIUnit {\npublic:\n    bool CanMoveToPosition(Map* map, int position)\
      \ {\n        return pathfindingAdapter.IsWalkablePosition(map, position);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks based on the current state of the map and its
    terrain data. It may involve spatial queries or collision detection internally.
    For performance-critical applications, caching results for frequently checked
    positions is recommended.
  warnings: Ensure that the Map pointer passed to this method is valid and initialized;
    passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    be aware that position coordinates must align with the map's coordinate system
    for accurate evaluation.
