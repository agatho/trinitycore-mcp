documentation:
  brief: Checks if a strategy with the specified name exists in the strategy factory.
  description: The HasStrategy method determines whether a strategy with the given
    name has been registered within the StrategyFactory instance. This is commonly
    used in AI systems to verify the availability of specific behavior strategies
    before attempting to apply or utilize them. The method performs a lookup operation
    against an internal collection of registered strategies and returns true if a
    match is found, otherwise false. This functionality supports dynamic AI behavior
    selection and ensures safe usage of strategies within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a strategy with the specified name exists in the factory;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Existence Check
    code: "if (strategyFactory.HasStrategy(\"combat\")) {\n    // Proceed with combat-related\
      \ logic\n    std::cout << \"Combat strategy is available\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Behavior Activation
    code: "if (strategyFactory.HasStrategy(\"escort\")) {\n    // Activate escort\
      \ behavior\n    player->SetAI(new EscortAI(player));\n} else {\n    // Fallback\
      \ to default AI\n    player->SetAI(new DefaultAI(player));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through registered strategies, so performance
    may degrade with a large number of strategies. The implementation assumes that
    strategy names are unique and case-sensitive. It's recommended to cache the result
    of this check if it's performed frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that strategy names passed to this method match exactly with those
    registered, including case sensitivity. This method does not validate the strategy's
    functionality beyond its existence in the factory.
