  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateGroupHealing(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group healing actions during dungeon encounters based on encounter
    state and group composition.
  description: The CoordinateGroupHealing method manages and orchestrates healing
    efforts within a dungeon group during specific encounter phases. It evaluates
    the current state of the dungeon encounter, assesses the health status of group
    members, and determines appropriate healing strategies or actions to maintain
    group viability. This method is typically invoked by the DungeonBehavior AI system
    when a group enters a critical phase of an encounter where coordinated healing
    becomes essential for survival. The method ensures that healing efforts are distributed
    effectively among group members based on their roles, current health levels, and
    the encounter's progression.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the dungeon group currently
      engaged in the encounter. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter state, including phase information, health thresholds, and encounter-specific
      rules for healing coordination.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Coordination Call
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEncounterPhaseChange(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_CRITICAL)\n    {\n  \
      \      CoordinateGroupHealing(group, encounter);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Healing Strategy with Custom Logic
    code: "void AdvancedDungeonBehavior::HandleEncounterEvent(Group* group, const\
      \ DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n{\n    // Evaluate if healing coordination is\
      \ needed\n    if (encounter.GetRemainingHealthPercentage() < 30.0f && group->GetMembersCount()\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        CoordinateGroupHealing(group, encounter);\n    }\n  \
      \  else if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_BOSS_ENRAGE)\n    {\n        // Special\
      \ handling for enrage phase\n        CoordinateGroupHealing(group, encounter);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the DungeonEncounter object to determine appropriate
    healing strategies. It assumes that group members are properly initialized with
    health and role information. The method may trigger internal AI decision-making
    processes such as target selection, spell casting, or healer assignment based
    on encounter state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and contains at least one member
    before calling this method. Passing an invalid or empty group may lead to undefined
    behavior. The method does not validate encounter data, so malformed DungeonEncounter
    objects could cause unexpected healing behaviors.
