  signature: void VendorInteraction::ExecuteBuyingStrategy(Player * player, uint32
    vendorGuid, const BuyingStrategy & strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a buying strategy for a player interacting with a vendor.
  description: The ExecuteBuyingStrategy method processes and applies a specified
    buying strategy to a player's interaction with a vendor. It determines which items
    should be purchased based on the provided strategy configuration, considering
    factors such as item quality, price, and player inventory constraints. This method
    is typically invoked during vendor interactions to automate purchasing decisions
    according to predefined rules or player preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the interacting player.
      Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: vendorGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor the player is interacting
      with. Used to locate and validate the vendor in the game world.
  - name: strategy
    description: Reference to a BuyingStrategy object that defines the rules and parameters
      for item purchasing behavior, such as price thresholds, quality requirements,
      and quantity limits.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BuyingStrategy strategy;

      strategy.maxPrice = 10000;

      strategy.minQuality = ITEM_QUALITY_UNCOMMON;

      VendorInteraction::ExecuteBuyingStrategy(player, vendorGuid, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Strategy with Multiple Conditions
    code: 'BuyingStrategy advancedStrategy;

      advancedStrategy.maxPrice = 50000;

      advancedStrategy.minQuality = ITEM_QUALITY_RARE;

      advancedStrategy.itemCategories.push_back(ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON);

      advancedStrategy.itemCategories.push_back(ITEM_CLASS_ARMOR);

      VendorInteraction::ExecuteBuyingStrategy(player, vendorGuid, advancedStrategy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and vendor are within valid interaction
    range. The strategy object should be properly initialized before calling this
    method to avoid unexpected behavior. Performance may be impacted if large numbers
    of items are processed during a single execution.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null and that the vendorGuid corresponds
    to an actual vendor in the game world. Incorrect usage may lead to invalid item
    purchases or crashes.
