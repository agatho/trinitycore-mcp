  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ProcessBatchTurnIn
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ProcessBatchTurnIn(Player * bot, const TurnInBatch
    & batch)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a batch of quest turn-ins for a player character.
  description: The ProcessBatchTurnIn method handles the execution of multiple quest
    completion actions for a given player. It iterates through a collection of turn-in
    data, validates each quest's requirements, and processes the rewards or updates
    associated with completing those quests. This method is typically used in automated
    questing systems or AI bots to efficiently manage multiple quest submissions without
    individual processing overhead. The method ensures proper state transitions for
    quests and handles any necessary item removal, experience gain, and reputation
    changes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the quest turn-ins. Must be a valid player instance with active quests.
  - name: batch
    description: Reference to a TurnInBatch structure containing all quest turn-in
      data to be processed. Includes quest identifiers, required items, and completion
      states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      TurnInBatch batch;

      // Populate batch with quest data

      QuestTurnIn::ProcessBatchTurnIn(player, batch);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Batch Processing with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nTurnInBatch batch;\n// Add multiple quests to batch\n\
      try {\n    QuestTurnIn::ProcessBatchTurnIn(player, batch);\n    // Handle successful\
      \ processing\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    // Log error and handle\
      \ failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes all quests in the batch have been validated prior to
    calling. The implementation may modify player inventory, quest state, and character
    attributes directly. Performance is optimized for batch operations but may still
    involve multiple database transactions depending on quest complexity.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or unvalidated TurnInBatch data as
    it may cause undefined behavior or corruption of player state. Ensure the player
    object remains valid throughout execution to prevent memory access violations.
