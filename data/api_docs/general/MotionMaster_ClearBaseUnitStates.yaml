documentation:
  brief: Clears all base unit states from the MotionMaster.
  description: The ClearBaseUnitStates method removes all currently active base unit
    states from the MotionMaster instance. This method is typically used to reset
    the movement state of a unit, ensuring that no conflicting or outdated movement
    behaviors are applied. It clears internal state flags that control basic movement
    behaviors such as walking, running, flying, and other fundamental locomotion states.
    The operation is generally performed when transitioning between different movement
    types or when resetting a unit's motion behavior to a clean slate.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing base unit states on a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      MotionMaster& motionMaster = creature->GetMotionMaster();

      motionMaster.ClearBaseUnitStates();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may interrupt ongoing movement
    sequences. It's typically used internally by the AI system when reinitializing
    a unit's motion behavior or during state transitions.
