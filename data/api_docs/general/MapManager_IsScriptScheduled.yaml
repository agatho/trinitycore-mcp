  signature: bool MapManager::IsScriptScheduled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether any script is currently scheduled for execution on the map
    manager.
  description: The IsScriptScheduled method determines if there are any pending scripts
    that have been scheduled for execution within the MapManager's context. This functionality
    is typically used to manage asynchronous operations or delayed actions that need
    to be processed during the game loop. The method returns a boolean value indicating
    the presence of scheduled scripts, which can help in controlling execution flow
    and avoiding conflicts between concurrent operations. It is commonly utilized
    in TrinityCore's core systems for managing timed events, AI behavior, and other
    time-dependent mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are any scripts currently scheduled for execution;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (MapManager::Instance()->IsScriptScheduled()) {\n    // Handle case\
      \ where scripts are pending\n    sLog->outString(\"Scripts are currently scheduled.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateMapManager() {\n    if (!MapManager::Instance()->IsScriptScheduled())\
      \ {\n        // Perform regular map updates\n        MapManager::Instance()->Update();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Skip update to avoid conflicts with scheduled scripts\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Skipping update due to scheduled scripts.\");\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework for
    managing script execution queues. It's important to note that this check does
    not guarantee that scripts will execute immediately after being scheduled, as
    they may be queued or delayed based on system load and priority settings.
