documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the GuardianIronfurTracker class for managing
    ironfur tracking mechanics.
  description: The GuardianIronfurTracker constructor initializes a new instance of
    the GuardianIronfurTracker class, which is responsible for tracking and managing
    the ironfur ability mechanics for guardians in World of Warcraft. This class likely
    handles the state management, cooldown tracking, and application of ironfur effects
    on guardian creatures. The initialization process sets up internal data structures
    necessary for monitoring when ironfur is active, how long it lasts, and any associated
    buffs or debuffs that may be applied. This constructor is typically called during
    the creation or spawning of guardian NPCs to ensure proper tracking of their ironfur
    ability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GuardianIronfurTracker instance
    code: 'GuardianIronfurTracker* tracker = new GuardianIronfurTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track ironfur mechanics

      // for a guardian creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, so it should only be called during
    object instantiation. The class likely contains internal state management for
    tracking ironfur duration, active status, and related cooldowns. Developers should
    ensure proper memory management when using this class.
