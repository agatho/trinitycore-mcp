  method: OnQuestAccept
  signature: void CreatureAI::OnQuestAccept(int * param0, const int * param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a player accepts a quest from the creature.
  description: The OnQuestAccept method is invoked in CreatureAI when a player accepts
    a quest offered by the creature. This method allows custom AI behavior to be implemented
    upon quest acceptance, such as triggering specific actions, modifying quest states,
    or initiating dialogue sequences. It is part of the standard TrinityCore AI event
    system and provides developers with the ability to extend default creature behavior
    during quest interactions. The method is called after the quest acceptance process
    has been initiated but before any quest-related rewards or objectives are applied.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's GUID (Global Unique
      Identifier) who accepted the quest.
  - name: param1
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID that was accepted
      by the player.
  returns: null

    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnQuestAccept(int* playerGUID, const int* questID)\n\
      {\n    // Log that a quest was accepted\n    sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID\
      \ %u accepted quest %d\", *playerGUID, *questID);\n    \n    // Trigger custom\
      \ behavior\n    if (*questID == 12345)\n    {\n        // Perform special action\
      \ for this quest\n        Talk(0, *playerGUID);\n    }\n}"

    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnQuestAccept(int* playerGUID, const int* questID)\n\
      {\n    // Store quest acceptance in creature's AI state\n    if (*questID ==\
      \ 67890)\n    {\n        SetData(DATA_QUEST_ACCEPTED, 1);\n        \n      \
      \  // Send quest-specific message to player\n        if (Player* player = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ *playerGUID)))\n        {\n            player->SendNotification(\"You have\
      \ accepted the special quest!\");\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the quest acceptance phase in the
    game's event loop. It should not be used to modify quest data directly, as that
    would interfere with the core quest system. Instead, it should be used for triggering
    visual effects, sounds, or other non-quest-modifying behaviors.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the quest state or player's quest log within
    this method, as doing so may cause unexpected behavior or conflicts with the game's
    internal quest management system. Ensure that any modifications to creature state
    are safe and do not lead to race conditions.
