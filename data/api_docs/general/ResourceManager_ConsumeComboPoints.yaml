documentation:
  brief: Consumes combo points from the player's resource manager, reducing their
    available combo point count.
  description: The ConsumeComboPoints method is responsible for deducting combo points
    from a player's current resource pool within the ResourceManager system. This
    method is typically invoked when a player performs actions that require consuming
    combo points, such as executing finisher abilities in rogue gameplay or other
    combo-point-based mechanics. The method modifies the internal state of the ResourceManager
    to reflect the reduced combo point count. It does not return any value and operates
    directly on the resource manager instance it is called from.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Combo Point Consumption
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      ResourceManager* resourceManager = player->GetResourceManager();

      resourceManager->ConsumeComboPoints();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's combo point tracking system
    and may be called automatically by game mechanics when combo point-consuming abilities
    are used. It is assumed to decrement a counter or modify a resource value in the
    ResourceManager class.
