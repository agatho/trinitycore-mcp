  class: Quest
  method: GetQuestGiverPortraitModelSceneId
  signature: int32 Quest::GetQuestGiverPortraitModelSceneId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the portrait model scene ID associated with the quest giver.
  description: This method retrieves the unique identifier for the portrait model
    scene that is used to display the quest giver's portrait in the game world. The
    returned value corresponds to a specific model scene defined in the database,
    which determines how the NPC's portrait appears during quest interaction. This
    ID is essential for proper quest UI presentation and can be used to identify specific
    visual representations of quest givers within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the portrait model scene ID. This
    ID typically corresponds to a valid model scene entry in the database, where negative
    values may indicate no portrait scene is associated with the quest giver.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 sceneId = quest->GetQuestGiverPortraitModelSceneId();\nif (sceneId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use sceneId to fetch model scene data\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ No portrait scene associated with this quest giver\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine how quest givers are visually represented. It should be noted that
    the returned value may vary depending on whether the quest giver has a specific
    portrait scene defined in the database.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return negative values if no portrait model
    scene is associated with the quest giver, which could affect visual presentation
    of the quest UI.
