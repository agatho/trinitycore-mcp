documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the vendor item data container is empty
  description: The Empty() method determines if the VendorItemData container holds
    any items. It returns true if there are no items in the vendor's inventory, and
    false if there are items present. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft
    TrinityCore server implementations to verify whether a vendor has any goods available
    for sale before performing operations such as displaying vendor windows or processing
    item purchases. The check is typically performed during vendor interaction logic
    to ensure proper game state handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the VendorItemData container contains no items, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if vendor has items before displaying UI
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorItems = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetVendorItems();\n\
      if (vendorItems->Empty()) {\n    // No items to display\n    SendNoItemsMessage();\n\
      } else {\n    // Display vendor items\n    DisplayVendorWindow();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Prevent empty vendor interactions
    code: "if (!vendorData->Empty()) {\n    // Process vendor transactions\n    for\
      \ (uint32 i = 0; i < vendorData->GetItemCount(); ++i) {\n        VendorItem\
      \ const* item = vendorData->GetItem(i);\n        // Handle item processing\n\
      \    }\n} else {\n    // Log or notify that vendor is out of stock\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Vendor has no items available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a constant-time check by examining the internal item
    count or container state. It does not iterate through items, making it efficient
    for frequent checks during gameplay. The implementation likely uses an internal
    size tracking mechanism rather than counting elements.
  warnings: Be aware that Empty() only checks if items exist in the vendor's inventory
    list. It doesn't validate item availability due to player requirements, quest
    conditions, or other dynamic constraints that might affect actual item purchase
    eligibility.
