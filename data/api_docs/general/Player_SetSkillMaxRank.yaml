  class: Player
  method: SetSkillMaxRank
  signature: void Player::SetSkillMaxRank(uint32 pos, uint16 max)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum rank for a specified skill in the player's skill list.
  description: This method allows developers to set the maximum rank that a specific
    skill can reach within the player's skill list. It is commonly used during character
    creation or when modifying player skill levels. The method updates the skill data
    internally, ensuring that the skill does not exceed its maximum allowed value.
    This functionality is crucial for maintaining game balance and player progression
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position of the skill in the player's skill list. This represents
      the index of the skill within the skill array, typically ranging from 0 to 255.
  - name: max
    description: The maximum rank value to set for the skill. This value must be between
      0 and 45000, representing the maximum skill level allowed by the game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting skill max rank for a specific skill
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillMaxRank(10, 300); // Sets the skill at position 10 to maximum
      rank of 300'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    such as SetSkill or SetSkillStep. It should be called carefully during character
    creation or when modifying player skills, as it affects the overall skill progression
    and game balance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unbalanced gameplay or incorrect
    skill progression. Developers should ensure that the max value does not exceed
    the maximum allowed by the game mechanics (45000).
