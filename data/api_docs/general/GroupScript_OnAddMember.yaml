documentation:
  brief: Called when a new member is added to a group
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework whenever a player
    is added to a group, such as when joining a raid, party, or battleground group.
    It allows script developers to execute custom logic in response to group membership
    changes. The method provides access to both the group object and the GUID of the
    newly added member, enabling actions like sending notifications, adjusting player
    stats, or triggering quest events. This callback is part of the GroupScript system
    that allows for extending default group behavior through scripting.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object to which the member was added. This represents
      the group structure containing the new member.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who was added to the group.
      This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database ID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Member Addition Handler
    code: "class MyGroupScript : public GroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyGroupScript()\
      \ : GroupScript(\"MyGroupScript\") {}\n\n    void OnAddMember(Group* group,\
      \ uint32 guid) override\n    {\n        // Log that a member was added to the\
      \ group\n        sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID %u was added to group %u\"\
      , guid, group->GetId());\n        \n        // Optionally send a message to\
      \ all group members\n        if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ guid)))\n        {\n            ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"\
      Welcome to the group!\");\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the group membership update process and should
    not perform heavy operations that could block other game systems. The group object
    passed in is guaranteed to be valid, but it may not yet be fully initialized with
    all members depending on the timing of the call.
  warnings: Avoid modifying the group structure or calling methods that might cause
    recursion during this callback. Also, ensure that any player lookups using the
    GUID are safe and don't result in null pointer dereferences if the player is not
    currently online.
