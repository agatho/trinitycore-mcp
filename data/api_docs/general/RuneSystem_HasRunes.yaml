  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient runes of specified types to perform an
    action
  description: The HasRunes method determines whether a player possesses enough runes
    of each specified type (blood, frost, unholy) to execute a given ability or spell.
    This method is typically used in the context of Death Knight class abilities within
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation. It evaluates the current
    rune counts against the required amounts and returns true if all rune requirements
    are met, otherwise false. The method does not modify any internal state and is
    purely a query operation.
  parameters:
  - name: blood
    description: The number of blood runes required for the action
  - name: frost
    description: The number of frost runes required for the action
  - name: unholy
    description: The number of unholy runes required for the action
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least the specified number of blood,
    frost, and unholy runes; otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Checking rune requirements for a Death Knight ability
    code: "if (player->GetRuneSystem()->HasRunes(1, 1, 0)) {\n    // Player has at\
      \ least 1 blood rune and 1 frost rune\n    // Can cast a spell requiring these\
      \ runes\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating multiple rune requirements for a complex ability
    code: "RuneSystem* runeSys = player->GetRuneSystem();\nif (runeSys->HasRunes(2,\
      \ 1, 1)) {\n    // Player has at least 2 blood runes, 1 frost rune, and 1 unholy\
      \ rune\n    // Can cast a high-cost Death Knight ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's current rune state and does not account
    for any pending rune regeneration or cooldowns. It is commonly used before attempting
    to consume runes for abilities to prevent invalid actions. The method assumes
    that all parameters are non-negative values.
  warnings: Ensure that the rune counts passed to this method do not exceed the maximum
    possible rune count (typically 6 for each type in WoW). Passing negative values
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
