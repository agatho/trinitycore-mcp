  class: GameObject
  method: SetOwnerGUID
  signature: void GameObject::SetOwnerGUID(int owner)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the owner GUID for the game object, establishing the relationship between
    the object and its owner.
  description: The SetOwnerGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a GameObject,
    linking it to its owner entity. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft to
    establish ownership of game objects such as doors, chests, or other interactive
    elements. The method typically sets the owner GUID to either a player's GUID or
    another GameObject's GUID, depending on the context and usage. It is essential
    for maintaining proper game mechanics and ensuring that the object correctly references
    its owner during gameplay interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: The GUID of the entity that owns the game object. This can be a player's
      GUID or another GameObject's GUID, depending on the context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting owner GUID for a chest
    code: 'GameObject* chest = new GameObject();

      chest->SetOwnerGUID(player->GetGUID());

      // The chest now has the player''s GUID as its owner'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the object's ownership
    and can influence gameplay mechanics such as loot distribution, interaction with
    players, and object behavior. Ensure that the GUID being set is valid and corresponds
    to an actual entity in the game world.
  warnings: Improper use of SetOwnerGUID may lead to incorrect ownership behavior
    or game-breaking issues. Avoid setting invalid GUIDs or GUIDs that do not correspond
    to existing entities in the game world.
