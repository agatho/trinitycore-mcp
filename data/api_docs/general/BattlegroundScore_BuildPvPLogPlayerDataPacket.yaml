    const
documentation:
  brief: Populates a player data integer with battleground statistics and performance
    metrics.
  description: The BuildPvPLogPlayerDataPacket method constructs and fills an integer
    value with encoded player performance data for battleground logging purposes.
    This method aggregates various PvP-related statistics such as kills, deaths, healing
    done, and other combat metrics into a single packed integer format suitable for
    transmission to clients or storage in battleground logs. The packed data typically
    includes information about the player's contribution during the match, which is
    used by the game client to display detailed PvP statistics after the battleground
    ends. This method is part of the battleground scoring system and is called internally
    when preparing log data for players at the end of a match.
  parameters:
  - name: playerData
    description: Reference to an integer that will be populated with packed player
      battleground statistics. The value is modified in-place to contain encoded performance
      metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground scoring
    code: 'BattlegroundScore score;

      int playerData = 0;

      score.BuildPvPLogPlayerDataPacket(playerData);

      // playerData now contains packed PvP statistics for logging'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground cleanup and result processing.
    The exact bit layout of the packed integer is implementation-defined and may vary
    between game versions. It's important to note that this method modifies its parameter
    in-place, so any existing value in playerData will be overwritten.
