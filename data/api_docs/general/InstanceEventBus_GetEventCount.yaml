documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of events registered for a specific instance event type.
  description: The GetEventCount method returns the number of events currently registered
    within the InstanceEventBus for a given instance event type. This method is typically
    used to monitor or query the state of event handling within an instance, such
    as tracking how many mobs have been spawned, objectives completed, or other scripted
    events that are pending or active. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for read operations. It requires a valid InstanceEventType enum value
    to accurately return the count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the number of events registered for the specified
    instance event type. Returns zero if no events are registered or if an invalid
    event type is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Get Count of Mob Spawn Events
    code: "uint64 mobCount = instanceEventBus.GetEventCount(InstanceEventType::MOB_SPAWN);\n\
      if (mobCount > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Active mob spawns: \" << mobCount <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Active Events Before Cleanup
    code: "if (instanceEventBus.GetEventCount(InstanceEventType::QUEST_COMPLETE) ==\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with instance cleanup\n    instanceEventBus.ClearAllEvents();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a constant-time lookup, making it efficient for frequent
    calls. It is designed to be thread-safe and should not block other operations
    in the event bus. The method assumes that InstanceEventType values are properly
    validated before being passed.
  warnings: Ensure that the InstanceEventType enum value passed to this method is
    valid; passing an invalid or uninitialized enum value may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect counts. This method does not validate the type of events stored,
    only their count.
