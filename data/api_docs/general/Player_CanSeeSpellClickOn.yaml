  signature: bool Player::CanSeeSpellClickOn(const Creature * creature) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player can see a spell click on a creature.
  description: This method checks if the player has the ability to interact with a
    creature's spell click functionality, which typically occurs when the player is
    within range of a quest or NPC that requires spell click interaction. The method
    evaluates whether the player's current state allows them to see and potentially
    interact with the creature's spell click, considering factors such as distance,
    visibility, and player state. It is commonly used in questing mechanics where
    players must click on specific NPCs to progress quests or receive rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can see the creature's spell click, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player has the necessary conditions to interact with
    the creature's spell click functionality.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->CanSeeSpellClickOn(creature)) {\n    // Player can see spell\
      \ click\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other player interaction
    checks and may depend on the creature's visibility and distance from the player.
    It is important to note that this method does not directly perform the spell click
    interaction itself, but rather determines if the player can see it.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in questing contexts as it may affect
    whether a player can interact with certain NPCs. Improper use of this method could
    lead to players being unable to progress through quests or receive rewards.
