documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new suggestion ticket for the specified player.
  description: The SuggestionTicket constructor initializes a new ticket object associated
    with a specific player. This method sets up the internal state of the ticket,
    including assigning the player reference and initializing default values for ticket
    properties such as creation time, status, and priority. The ticket is typically
    created when a player submits a suggestion through the in-game interface or via
    the ticket system. This constructor ensures that all necessary data structures
    are properly allocated and initialized before the ticket can be processed by the
    ticket management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new suggestion ticket for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is valid

      SuggestionTicket ticket(player);

      // The ticket is now initialized and ready to be processed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any database operations or network communication.
    It only initializes the in-memory object state. The actual persistence of the
    ticket data occurs later when the ticket is saved to the database through other
    methods such as SaveToDB().
