documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Paladin AI instance for a bot
  description: The CreatePaladinAI method is responsible for instantiating a new Paladin
    AI behavior controller for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method typically allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the initial state
    and configuration specific to paladin class behaviors, and integrates the AI with
    the bot's existing game entity. The method operates within the context of the
    ClassAIFactory pattern, which manages creation of various AI types based on character
    class. It is commonly used during bot initialization or when switching class configurations
    for automated player characters.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or handle.
      This parameter is typically used to associate the newly created AI with a specific
      bot instance in the system.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as memory allocation failure,
    invalid bot handle, or unsupported class configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Paladin AI Creation
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreatePaladinAI(&botId);\nif\
      \ (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for bot\n    printf(\"Paladin\
      \ AI created for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to create Paladin AI for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a factory pattern implementation and should be called
    only after proper initialization of the ClassAIFactory. The bot parameter must
    point to a valid bot identifier that has been registered with the system. Memory
    management for the AI instance is handled internally by the factory.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered bot handle may result
    in undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that the bot exists and is
    properly initialized before calling this method. The returned integer value should
    always be checked to confirm successful AI creation.
