  class: BotThreatManager
  method: SetBotRole
  signature: void BotThreatManager::SetBotRole(ThreatRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the threat role for a bot within the threat management system.
  description: The SetBotRole method assigns a specific ThreatRole to a bot, determining
    how the bot should behave in terms of threat generation and management. This is
    crucial for AI-driven bots that need to follow defined roles such as tank, healer,
    or damage dealer. The method updates internal state within the BotThreatManager
    to reflect the new role, which may affect the bot's targeting behavior, threat
    calculation, and overall combat strategy. It is typically called during bot initialization
    or when switching roles during a fight.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The ThreatRole enum value specifying the bot's role in threat management.
      Valid values include TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, and others depending on the implementation.
      This determines how the bot interacts with threat mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Bot to Tank Role
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatMgr = bot->GetThreatManager();

      threatMgr->SetBotRole(ThreatRole::TANK);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Role Switching in Combat
    code: "if (player->GetHealthPercent() < 30)\n{\n    bot->GetThreatManager()->SetBotRole(ThreatRole::HEALER);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    bot->GetThreatManager()->SetBotRole(ThreatRole::DAMAGE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the bot's combat behavior and should be called
    before or during combat to ensure proper threat management. The internal state
    changes made by this method may affect how other systems interact with the bot,
    such as target selection and threat distribution.
  warnings: Calling SetBotRole without proper initialization of the bot's AI components
    may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot is fully initialized before
    setting its role.
