documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot's combat behavior based on elapsed time and current combat
    state
  description: The UpdateCombat method is responsible for managing the artificial
    intelligence behavior of a bot during active combat situations. It processes the
    bot's decision-making logic, including target selection, spell casting, movement
    adjustments, and tactical positioning based on the provided time delta. This method
    is typically called repeatedly by the game loop to ensure responsive and dynamic
    combat behavior. The method evaluates the current combat state, checks for valid
    targets, and executes appropriate actions such as attacking, casting spells, or
    moving to optimal positions. It integrates with the broader TrinityCore AI system
    to maintain consistent bot behavior throughout combat encounters.

  - title: Basic UpdateCombat Usage
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        botCombatAI->UpdateCombat(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the bot is actively engaged in combat.
    The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds elapsed since last update, which
    affects timing-sensitive actions like spell cooldowns and movement calculations.
    The method internally manages state transitions between different combat phases
    such as targeting, casting, and positioning.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat may cause undefined behavior or
    performance issues. Ensure that the bot's target is valid before calling UpdateCombat
    to avoid unnecessary processing. The method assumes proper initialization of all
    AI components and should not be invoked on uninitialized bot instances.
