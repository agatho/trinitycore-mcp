documentation:
  brief: Removes the object from the object update list, preventing it from being
    updated in the next update cycle.
  description: This method removes the current object from the object update list,
    which is used by the game server to manage object updates during each tick of
    the world update loop. The method ensures that the object will not be processed
    for updates in the upcoming update cycles, effectively removing it from the active
    update list. This is typically used when an object needs to be temporarily removed
    from the world update process, such as during teleportation or when a player logs
    out. The removal does not immediately delete the object but rather prevents it
    from being included in the update cycle until it is re-added.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void MyObject::RemoveFromObjectUpdate()\n{\n    // Remove this object from\
      \ the update list\n    Object::RemoveFromObjectUpdate();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    objects need to be removed from the update list. It should not be called directly
    by developers unless specifically required for custom object management. Performance-wise,
    removing objects from update lists is a lightweight operation and does not significantly
    impact server performance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to objects not being properly updated
    in the world, potentially causing visual artifacts or game mechanics issues. It
    should only be used when the object needs to be removed from active update processing.
