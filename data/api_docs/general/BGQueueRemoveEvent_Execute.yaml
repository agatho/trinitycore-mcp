documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the battleground queue and returns true if successful
  description: The BGQueueRemoveEvent::Execute method is responsible for processing
    the removal of a player from the battleground queue system. This method is typically
    invoked as part of an event handling mechanism within TrinityCore's battleground
    framework. It ensures that players are properly removed from queued states, updates
    internal queue structures, and handles cleanup operations associated with queue
    removal. The method operates based on time-based execution and manages the transition
    of players from queued status to available status in the battleground system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player was successfully removed from the battleground
    queue, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that the player was
    not found in the queue or that the removal operation failed due to internal state
    issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in event handling
    code: "BGQueueRemoveEvent* event = new BGQueueRemoveEvent(playerGuid);\nbool success\
      \ = event->Execute(getMSTime(), 0);\nif (success)\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player removed from queue successfully\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's internal event system and should only
    be called through proper event queuing mechanisms. The method assumes that the
    player GUID has been properly validated before execution. It may perform database
    operations to update player queue status.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper event handling can lead to
    inconsistent queue states and potential crashes. Ensure that all preconditions
    for queue removal are met before invoking this method.
