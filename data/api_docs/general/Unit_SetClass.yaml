documentation:
  brief: Sets the class ID of the unit to the specified value.
  description: This method assigns a class ID to the Unit object, which determines
    the character's class type (warrior, paladin, hunter, etc.). The class ID is typically
    represented as a numeric value corresponding to the player's class. This method
    is commonly used during character creation or when changing class types during
    gameplay. It affects the unit's ability to use specific abilities and spells based
    on their class.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The numeric identifier representing the class type. Valid values
      are 1-11 for warrior, paladin, hunter, rogue, priest, death knight, shaman,
      mage, warlock, druid, and demonhunter respectively.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting class to Warrior
    code: Unit->SetClass(1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting class to Death Knight
    code: Unit->SetClass(12);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the unit's ability to
    use class-specific spells and abilities. The class ID must be valid and within
    the expected range for the game mechanics to function properly.
  warnings: Setting an invalid class ID may cause issues with spell usage or character
    progression. Ensure that the class ID corresponds to a valid class in the game.
