documentation:
  brief: Rolls back player bot migration to a specified version
  description: The RollbackMigration method attempts to revert the player bot migration
    process to a previously recorded version. This functionality is typically used
    during development or debugging when it's necessary to undo changes made by a
    migration. The method checks if the specified version exists in the migration
    history and performs the rollback operation accordingly. It ensures data consistency
    by reverting all related player bot configurations, behaviors, and settings to
    match the target version state.
  parameters:
  - name: version
    description: The target version string to which the migration should be rolled
      back. This should correspond to a valid migration version previously recorded
      in the system.
  returns: Returns true if the rollback operation was successful and all player bot
    configurations were properly reverted to the specified version. Returns false
    if the rollback failed due to invalid version, missing migration data, or other
    internal errors during the rollback process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Rollback Usage
    code: "if (PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->RollbackMigration(\"1.2.3\")) {\n\
      \    // Migration rollback successful\n    sLog->outString(\"Player bot migration\
      \ rolled back to version 1.2.3\");\n} else {\n    // Handle rollback failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to rollback player bot migration to version 1.2.3\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the migration history contains a record of the specified
    version and that all necessary rollback procedures are implemented for that version.
    The operation may involve database modifications and should be performed with
    caution in production environments.
  warnings: Rollback operations can potentially cause data inconsistency if not properly
    handled. Ensure that no active player bots are using the system during rollback
    operations, as this could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.
