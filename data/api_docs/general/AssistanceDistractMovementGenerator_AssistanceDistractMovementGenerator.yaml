  class: AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator
  method: AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator
  signature: void AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator::AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator(int
    timer, float orientation)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new assistance distract movement generator with specified timer
    and orientation values.
  description: The AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement
    generator used in AI behavior for NPCs to perform a distracted movement pattern
    while assisting allies. This generator typically sets up internal state variables
    including a timer for how long the distraction should last and an orientation
    angle that determines the direction of movement. The timer parameter controls
    the duration of the distract behavior, and the orientation defines the facing
    direction during the movement. This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI system
    and is commonly used in creature AI scripts to create more dynamic and realistic
    NPC behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: timer
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the distract movement should
      be active. Controls how long the NPC will remain in the distracted state before
      returning to normal behavior.
  - name: orientation
    description: The facing orientation angle (in radians) that determines the direction
      the NPC will move during the distract behavior. Used to control where the NPC
      looks and moves while distracted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Assistance Distract Movement
    code: AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator generator(5000, M_PI_2); // 5 second
      distraction, facing right
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in NPC AI Script Context
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Start distract movement when target is low health\n     \
      \   if (me->GetVictim() && me->GetVictim()->GetHealthPct() < 20)\n        {\n\
      \            me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveGenerator = new AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator(3000,\
      \ me->GetOrientation());\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the AI system and should
    not be called directly in most cases. The movement generator will automatically
    manage its own lifecycle and cleanup after the timer expires. This implementation
    assumes that the NPC has a valid motion master and that the orientation value
    is within acceptable bounds for the game world.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the internal
    AI system architecture. Improper use may lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior
    in creature movement. The timer value should be carefully chosen to avoid excessive
    CPU usage during long-running AI behaviors.
