  brief: Moves the contents of another TransportPathLeg object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for TransportPathLeg transfers all resources
    from the source object to the current object, leaving the source in a valid but
    unspecified state. This operation is typically used in scenarios where temporary
    or intermediate TransportPathLeg objects need to be efficiently transferred without
    unnecessary copying. In the context of TrinityCore's transport system, this method
    supports efficient management of path data for moving transports like boats or
    zeppelins across the game world. The move operation ensures that any existing
    resources in the current object are properly cleaned up before acquiring the new
    ones.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current TransportPathLeg object, allowing for chaining
    of assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'TransportPathLeg leg1;

      TransportPathLeg leg2 = std::move(leg1); // Uses move assignment

      // leg1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // leg2 contains the moved data'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container
    code: 'std::vector<TransportPathLeg> legs;

      TransportPathLeg newLeg;

      legs.push_back(std::move(newLeg)); // Move-constructs into vector

      // newLeg is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics, which is more efficient than copy
    semantics for large objects. The source object after a move operation should not
    be used unless it's subsequently reassigned or destroyed. In TrinityCore's transport
    system, this optimization helps reduce memory allocations when managing path data
    for moving transports.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source TransportPathLeg object should
    not be accessed or used in any way that assumes it contains valid data. The object
    will be left in a valid but unspecified state, and using it may result in undefined
    behavior.
