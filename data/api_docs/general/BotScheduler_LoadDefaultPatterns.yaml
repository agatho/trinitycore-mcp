documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads default scheduling patterns for bot behavior management
  description: The LoadDefaultPatterns method initializes the default scheduling patterns
    used by the BotScheduler to manage bot behavior execution. This method is typically
    called during system initialization or when resetting bot scheduling configurations.
    It sets up predefined time-based schedules that determine when specific bot actions
    should be executed, such as quest completion, loot management, or combat behavior.
    The method ensures that bots have a baseline set of scheduling rules before any
    custom patterns are applied.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadDefaultPatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization to avoid overwriting
    existing patterns. The default patterns are designed to provide basic bot functionality
    and may need to be supplemented with custom patterns for specific server configurations.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate pattern entries
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that no active bots are running when calling this
    method to prevent conflicts with existing scheduling.
