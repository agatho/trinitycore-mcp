  signature: void TempSummon::SetCanFollowOwner(bool can)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the temporary summon can follow its owner.
  description: The SetCanFollowOwner method controls whether a TempSummon instance
    is allowed to follow its owner within the game world. This functionality is typically
    used for summoned creatures such as pets or guardians that should maintain proximity
    to their summoner. When enabled, the summon will attempt to stay near its owner;
    when disabled, it may behave independently or remain stationary depending on other
    AI settings. The method directly modifies internal flags within the TempSummon
    object that govern its movement behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: can
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the summon can follow its owner.
      True enables following, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Summon Following
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = ...;

      summon->SetCanFollowOwner(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Summon Following
    code: 'TempSummon* summon = ...;

      summon->SetCanFollowOwner(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the AI behavior of temporary summons and should be called
    before or during the summon's active lifetime to ensure proper initialization.
    It does not immediately reposition the summon but changes its movement logic for
    future updates.
