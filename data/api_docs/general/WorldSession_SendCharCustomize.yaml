    * customizeInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Sends character customization data to the client.
  description: The SendCharCustomize method is responsible for transmitting character
    customization information from the server to the connected client. This method
    is typically invoked during character creation or when a player modifies their
    character's appearance. It uses the provided result code and customization info
    packet to construct and send the appropriate network message. The method ensures
    that the client receives updated visual data about the character's appearance,
    including race, gender, facial features, and other customizable attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: An integer value indicating the outcome of the customization operation.
      Common values include success (0), invalid customization data (-1), or other
      error codes that inform the client about the result of the customization attempt.
  - name: customizeInfo
    description: A pointer to a CharCustomizeInfo packet structure containing detailed
      information about the character's current customization settings. This includes
      race, gender, skin color, facial features, hair style and color, etc., which
      are used by the client to render the character model correctly.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Character Creation
    code: 'WorldPackets::Character::CharCustomizeInfo customizeInfo;

      // ... populate customizeInfo with character data ...

      SendCharCustomize(0, &customizeInfo);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Customization Result
    code: "if (isValidCustomization)\n{\n    SendCharCustomize(0, &customizeInfo);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    SendCharCustomize(-1, nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the network layer to send packets to
    the client. It should only be called when a valid session exists and the client
    is ready to receive customization data. The customizeInfo parameter must be properly
    initialized before being passed to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid session or with an uninitialized customizeInfo
    structure may lead to client-side crashes or incorrect rendering of character
    models. Always validate input parameters before invoking this method.
