  class: SpellInfo
  method: GetSpellVisual
  signature: uint32 SpellInfo::GetSpellVisual(const WorldObject * caster, const WorldObject
    * viewer) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell visual ID for a given spell based on caster and viewer
    objects.
  description: This method retrieves the spell visual ID associated with a specific
    spell, taking into account the caster and viewer objects to determine the appropriate
    visual representation. The spell visual ID is used to determine which graphical
    effects are displayed for the spell, such as particle effects or animations. This
    method is typically used in conjunction with spell-related visual processing within
    the TrinityCore framework to ensure proper display of spell effects based on object
    relationships.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the spell visual ID (uint32) which corresponds to the visual representation
    of the spell. A value of 0 indicates no visual effect or an invalid visual ID,
    while non-zero values represent valid spell visual IDs used for rendering.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 visualId = spellInfo->GetSpellVisual(caster, viewer);\nif (visualId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process visual effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during spell processing and requires proper
    caster/viewer object validation to ensure accurate results. The method may return
    different visual IDs depending on the context of the spell being processed, such
    as when a spell is cast by a player versus an NPC.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with different caster/viewer
    combinations, as incorrect object references can lead to invalid visual IDs or
    no visual effects being displayed. Ensure that both objects are valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method.
