  signature: void GroupCombatStrategy::GroupCombatStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the GroupCombatStrategy class for managing
    group-based combat behaviors in World of Warcraft.
  description: The GroupCombatStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupCombatStrategy class, which is responsible for handling combat behaviors
    specific to player groups in TrinityCore. This strategy manages how group members
    engage in combat, including coordination of attacks, positioning, and resource
    management during encounters. The initialization process sets up internal data
    structures and state variables required for group-based AI decision making. This
    constructor is typically called when creating or resetting a group's combat behavior
    system, ensuring that all necessary components are properly configured before
    any combat actions are executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GroupCombatStrategy instance
    code: 'GroupCombatStrategy* strategy = new GroupCombatStrategy();

      // The strategy is now initialized and ready to manage group combat behaviors'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GroupCombatStrategy in a group context
    code: "class PlayerGroup {\nprivate:\n    GroupCombatStrategy* combat_strategy;\n\
      public:\n    void InitializeCombatStrategy() {\n        combat_strategy = new\
      \ GroupCombatStrategy();\n        // Strategy is now ready to handle group combat\
      \ decisions\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization that would block
    execution. It simply sets up basic internal state for the combat strategy. The
    actual combat behavior logic is typically invoked through other methods like Update(),
    Execute(), or similar decision-making functions. Developers should ensure that
    this constructor is called before attempting to use any combat-related functionality.
  warnings: This method does not validate input parameters since it takes no parameters,
    but developers should be aware that improper usage of the resulting object (e.g.,
    calling methods without proper initialization) may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. The class assumes that group members and their states are properly
    managed by other systems in the TrinityCore framework.
