  method: Initialize
  signature: void BotCustomizationGenerator::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot customization generator with default settings and data
    structures.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotCustomizationGenerator class
    for use by setting up internal data structures, loading necessary configuration
    files, and initializing default values for bot character customizations. This
    method should be called once during the system initialization phase before any
    bot customization operations are performed. It ensures that all required resources
    are allocated and ready for generating randomized or preset bot character appearances.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotCustomizationGenerator generator;

      generator.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when a new instance
    of the generator needs to be prepared. It performs resource allocation and configuration
    loading, so calling it multiple times may result in unnecessary overhead or potential
    memory leaks if not properly managed.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the generator has been actively used for
    generating customizations, as it may reset internal state and invalidate existing
    data. Ensure all dependencies are available before initialization to prevent runtime
    errors.
