  class: HealInfo
  method: GetAbsorb
  signature: uint32 HealInfo::GetAbsorb() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total amount of absorb effects that were applied to the heal.
  description: 'The GetAbsorb method retrieves the cumulative absorb amount that was
    applied to a heal operation. In World of Warcraft''s combat system, absorbs are
    temporary protective effects that reduce incoming damage or increase healing effectiveness.
    This value represents how much of the heal was absorbed by protective effects
    such as Power Word: Shield, Divine Shield, or other absorb-based abilities. The
    method is typically used in healing calculations and combat log reporting to accurately
    reflect the actual healing done after accounting for absorb effects.'
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total absorb amount applied to
    the heal operation. This value indicates how much of the original heal was nullified
    or redirected by absorb effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Healing Calculation
    code: "void HandleHeal(HealInfo* info)\n{\n    uint32 absorbedAmount = info->GetAbsorb();\n\
      \    uint32 actualHeal = info->GetHeal() - absorbedAmount;\n    // Process the\
      \ actual healing after absorb reduction\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Log Reporting with Absorb Data
    code: "void ReportHeal(HealInfo* info)\n{\n    uint32 totalHeal = info->GetHeal();\n\
      \    uint32 absorbed = info->GetAbsorb();\n    uint32 effectiveHeal = totalHeal\
      \ - absorbed;\n    // Log the heal with absorb information for combat analysis\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Heal: %u (Absorbed: %u, Effective: %u)\", totalHeal,\
      \ absorbed, effectiveHeal);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a heal operation has been fully processed
    and all absorb effects have been applied. The returned value is typically used
    for combat logging and healing statistics rather than being directly used in further
    calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the HealInfo object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid object may return unexpected
    values. This method does not account for partial absorbs or complex absorb interactions
    that might occur with certain abilities.
