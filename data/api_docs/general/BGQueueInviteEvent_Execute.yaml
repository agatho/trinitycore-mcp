  method: Execute
  signature: bool BGQueueInviteEvent::Execute(uint64 e_time, uint32 p_time)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles battleground queue invitation events for players.
  description: The BGQueueInviteEvent::Execute method is responsible for processing
    queued battleground invitations within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    is typically invoked as part of the game's event handling system to manage when
    players are invited to join battlegrounds. It evaluates the current state of the
    queue and determines whether a player should be notified or added to a battleground
    instance. The method operates on time-based triggers, using the provided execution
    time (e_time) and processing time (p_time) parameters to ensure proper scheduling
    and handling of invitations. This functionality is crucial for maintaining balanced
    and timely battleground matchmaking in World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: e_time
    description: The execution time in milliseconds when the event should be processed.
      This parameter determines when the invitation logic will run.
  - name: p_time
    description: The processing time in milliseconds that indicates how long this
      event should take to complete. Used for timing and scheduling purposes within
      the game loop.
  returns: Returns true if the execution was successful and the invitation was properly
    handled; otherwise returns false if an error occurred during processing or if
    the invitation could not be delivered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Event Handling
    code: "BGQueueInviteEvent* event = new BGQueueInviteEvent();\nbool success = event->Execute(1000,\
      \ 50);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Invitation processed successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Battleground invitation processed.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to process\
      \ invitation\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to process battleground invitation.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void UpdateBattlegroundQueue()\n{\n    uint64 currentTime = getMSTime();\n\
      \    BGQueueInviteEvent* inviteEvent = new BGQueueInviteEvent();\n    \n   \
      \ // Process pending invitations\n    if (!inviteEvent->Execute(currentTime,\
      \ 100))\n    {\n        sLog->outError(\"BGQueueInviteEvent failed at time %u\"\
      , currentTime);\n    }\n    \n    delete inviteEvent;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground queue management system
    and should not be called directly by external modules. The execution timing relies
    on accurate system time measurements to ensure proper invitation delivery. It
    may involve database operations for retrieving player and queue data, so performance
    can be affected by database load.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the intended event handling context
    as it may cause race conditions or inconsistent state in the battleground queue
    system. Improper parameter values for e_time or p_time could result in incorrect
    scheduling behavior or missed invitations.
