  class: QuestCompletion
  method: TurnInQuest
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::TurnInQuest(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a specified quest for a player character, updating quest progress
    and rewards.
  description: The TurnInQuest method processes the completion of a given quest for
    a specified player character. It validates whether the quest can be turned in,
    checks prerequisites such as required items or kills, and handles the reward distribution
    including experience, gold, and item rewards. The method updates the player's
    quest log and may trigger related quest events or objectives. This function is
    typically used by AI systems or quest automation scripts to programmatically complete
    quests for bots or automated players.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be completed. Must correspond
      to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who is turning
      in the quest. Must not be null and must be a valid player instance.
  returns: Returns true if the quest was successfully turned in and all rewards were
    processed; returns false if the quest could not be completed due to missing requirements,
    invalid quest ID, or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion
    code: "if (questCompletion->TurnInQuest(12345, playerBot)) {\n    // Quest completed\
      \ successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Quest 12345 turned in successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Failed to turn in quest\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to\
      \ turn in quest 12345.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Completion with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nPlayer* bot = session->GetPlayer();\nif (!bot)\
      \ {\n    sLog->outString(\"Invalid player reference.\");\n    return false;\n\
      }\n\nif (questCompletion->TurnInQuest(questId, bot)) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Quest %u completed successfully.\", questId);\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to complete quest %u.\", questId);\n    // Additional error handling\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all prerequisites for quest completion have been
    met by the player. It does not perform validation of quest requirements internally,
    so calling code should ensure the player has the necessary items or kills before
    invoking this method. The method may modify the player's inventory and quest log
    directly.
  warnings: Calling TurnInQuest without verifying that all quest requirements are
    satisfied can lead to inconsistent game state or missing rewards. This method
    does not check if the player is in a valid location or has the required quest
    status; such checks must be performed by the caller.
