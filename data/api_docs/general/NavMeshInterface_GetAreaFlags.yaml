  signature: uint32 NavMeshInterface::GetAreaFlags(Map * map, const int & position)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area flags for a given position within a specified map.
  description: The GetAreaFlags method retrieves the area flags associated with a
    specific position on a given map. Area flags define various properties of the
    terrain at that location, such as whether it's indoors, outdoors, water-based,
    or has special navigation restrictions. This method is commonly used in pathfinding
    and AI behavior to determine how units can move through different areas of the
    game world. The method takes a pointer to a Map object and an integer position
    identifier, which typically represents a specific coordinate or node within that
    map's navigation mesh.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object for which area flags are being retrieved.
      Must be a valid map instance; passing null may result in undefined behavior.
  - name: position
    description: Integer identifier representing a specific position within the map's
      navigation mesh. This typically corresponds to a node or coordinate index used
      by the navmesh system.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value containing the area flags for the specified position.
    Each bit in the returned value represents a different flag indicating properties
    such as indoor/outdoor status, water presence, or navigation restrictions. Common
    flags include flags for being inside buildings, underwater, or having special
    movement constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check area flags
    code: "Map* myMap = ...; // Get a valid map instance\nint position = 12345; //\
      \ Some position identifier\nuint32 flags = NavMeshInterface::GetAreaFlags(myMap,\
      \ position);\nif (flags & AREA_FLAG_INDOOR)\n{\n    // Handle indoor area logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for water-based areas
    code: "Map* map = ...;\nint pos = 54321;\nuint32 flags = NavMeshInterface::GetAreaFlags(map,\
      \ pos);\nif (flags & AREA_FLAG_WATER)\n{\n    // Unit is in a water area - adjust\
      \ movement or behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh data structure and assumes
    that the provided map has been properly initialized with navmesh data. The position
    parameter should correspond to valid nodes within the map's navigation system.
    Performance is generally good for single lookups, but repeated calls may benefit
    from caching results when possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the Map pointer is valid before calling this method, as passing
    a null pointer will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. The position parameter
    must represent a valid node within the map's navigation mesh; invalid positions
    may return unexpected flag values or cause errors.
