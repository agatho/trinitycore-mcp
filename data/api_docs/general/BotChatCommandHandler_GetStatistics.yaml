  class: BotChatCommandHandler
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & BotChatCommandHandler::GetStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the statistics object containing bot command execution metrics and
    performance data.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a comprehensive set of
    metrics related to the bot chat command handler's operations. This includes information
    about command execution counts, success rates, processing times, and other performance
    indicators. The returned Statistics object is immutable and reflects the current
    state of the handler's operational data since its initialization or last reset.
    This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis
    purposes within the TrinityCore bot framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics object containing detailed metrics
    about bot command processing, including execution counts, timing information,
    and success/failure statistics.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display bot statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = botChatCommandHandler.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total commands executed: " << stats.totalCommands << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Success rate: " << stats.successRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is read-only and should not be modified directly.
    The statistics are updated in real-time as commands are processed, making this
    method suitable for live monitoring. The data structure may include timing measurements
    that are platform-dependent.
  warnings: Accessing the statistics during high-frequency command processing might
    introduce minor performance overhead due to potential locking mechanisms. Ensure
    thread safety if accessing from multiple threads simultaneously.
