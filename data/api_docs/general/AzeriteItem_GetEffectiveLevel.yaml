  class: AzeriteItem
  method: GetEffectiveLevel
  signature: int AzeriteItem::GetEffectiveLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effective level of the Azerite item based on its
    current state and progression.
  description: The GetEffectiveLevel method determines the actual level of an Azerite
    item, which may differ from its base level due to various game mechanics such
    as Azerite power progression, level scaling, or player-specific modifiers. This
    value is crucial for determining the item's effectiveness in terms of Azerite
    traits and abilities. The method accounts for internal state changes within the
    AzeriteItem class and ensures accurate representation of the item's current power
    level. It does not modify any internal state and can be called multiple times
    without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the effective level of the Azerite item. This value
    typically reflects the item's progression through Azerite levels, which may be
    higher or lower than its base level depending on game mechanics and player progression.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();

      int effectiveLevel = item->GetEffectiveLevel();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Effective Azerite Level: %d", effectiveLevel);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Effective Level for Trait Calculation
    code: "AzeriteItem* item = player->GetAzeriteItem();\nint level = item->GetEffectiveLevel();\n\
      if (level >= 100)\n{\n    // Apply high-level trait bonuses\n    ApplyHighLevelBonuses();\n\
      }\nelse if (level >= 50)\n{\n    // Apply mid-level trait bonuses\n    ApplyMidLevelBonuses();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal Azerite progression tracking and should only
    be called when the AzeriteItem is in a valid state. The effective level may change
    dynamically as the player progresses through content or as Azerite powers are
    upgraded.
  warnings: Do not assume that the effective level will remain constant throughout
    an item's lifetime. It can fluctuate based on game events, such as completing
    Azerite milestones or changing gear sets.
