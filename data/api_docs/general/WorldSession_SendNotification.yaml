  class: WorldSession
  method: SendNotification
  signature: void WorldSession::SendNotification(uint32 stringId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a localized notification message to the client using a string ID from
    the database.
  description: The SendNotification method sends a formatted notification message
    to the connected player's client. It retrieves the localized string associated
    with the provided stringId from the database and displays it as a notification
    in the game interface. This method is commonly used for sending system messages,
    warnings, or status updates to players. The method does not return any value and
    directly communicates with the client through the session's network connection.
  parameters:
  - name: stringId
    description: The unique identifier of the localized string message stored in the
      database. This ID corresponds to entries in the trinity_string table or similar
      localization tables within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send a basic notification
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SendNotification(1001);\
      \ // Sends localized message with ID 1001\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send notification based on condition
    code: "if (player->GetLevel() < 10)\n{\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(LANG_LEVEL_REQUIREMENT);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(LANG_QUEST_COMPLETE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the localization system and requires that the stringId
    exists in the database. The actual message displayed depends on the client's language
    settings. This method is thread-safe as it operates within the context of a WorldSession
    which handles its own thread safety.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided stringId exists in the database to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior. Using invalid IDs may result in empty messages
    or system errors.
