  method: NeedsRepair
  signature: bool BotLifecycle::NeedsRepair() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot requires repair based on its current item condition
    and health status.
  description: The NeedsRepair method evaluates the bot's equipment and health to
    determine if it needs to be repaired. This includes checking for damaged items,
    low durability, and insufficient health or mana levels. The method is typically
    used in bot AI logic to decide when to visit a repair vendor or use repair spells.
    It considers both the physical condition of the bot's gear and its combat readiness
    state. The evaluation may include checking if the bot has sufficient gold to pay
    for repairs and whether repair services are available in the current location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot requires repair due to damaged items, low durability,
    or insufficient health/mana; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI
    code: "if (bot->GetBotLifecycle()->NeedsRepair()) {\n    bot->MoveToNearestRepairVendor();\n\
      \    bot->RepairItems();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Repair Logic
    code: "BotLifecycle* lifecycle = bot->GetBotLifecycle();\nif (lifecycle->NeedsRepair())\
      \ {\n    if (bot->HasSufficientGoldForRepairs()) {\n        bot->UseRepairSpell();\n\
      \    } else {\n        bot->NavigateToClosestVendor();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform multiple checks internally including item durability,
    health status, and mana levels. It's recommended to cache the result if checking
    this condition frequently during a single AI cycle to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: The method might return false even when items are damaged if the bot is
    in a location where repairs aren't available or if the bot doesn't have sufficient
    funds. Always verify repair availability and cost before attempting repairs.
