  method: FindBestPillar
  signature: const ArenaPillar * ArenaAI::FindBestPillar(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the best available pillar for an arena player to use during
    combat.
  description: The FindBestPillar method determines the most advantageous pillar position
    for a player in an arena environment. It evaluates available pillars based on
    factors such as distance, line of sight, and strategic positioning relative to
    opponents. The method is typically used by AI-controlled players or NPCs to optimize
    their positioning during arena battles. This function may consider player health,
    mana levels, and proximity to enemies when selecting the optimal pillar. The returned
    pointer points to a constant ArenaPillar object which represents the selected
    pillar's properties and location.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const ArenaPillar object representing the best available
    pillar for positioning. Returns nullptr if no suitable pillar is found or if the
    arena environment does not support pillar placement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Combat
    code: "const ArenaPillar* bestPillar = arenaAI->FindBestPillar(nullptr);\nif (bestPillar\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Move player to the best pillar position\n    player->TeleportTo(bestPillar->GetPosition());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that manages arena positioning.
    The selection algorithm may be influenced by current game state, such as player
    health or enemy positions. Performance-wise, this function should be lightweight
    since it's called frequently during combat.
  warnings: Ensure proper null checking when using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation
    faults. The method might return nullptr in edge cases like when all pillars are
    occupied or when the arena is not properly initialized.
