  signature: void InstanceScript::LoadObjectData(const ObjectData * creatureData,
    const ObjectData * gameObjectData)
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature and game object data for instance scripting.
  description: The LoadObjectData method is used in TrinityCore's InstanceScript class
    to initialize and load data structures containing information about creatures
    and game objects within a specific instance. This method typically processes predefined
    data arrays that define the spawn locations, identifiers, and other relevant properties
    of entities within the instance. It serves as a foundational setup step for managing
    dynamic content within dungeon or raid instances, ensuring that all scripted elements
    are properly registered and accessible during runtime. The method is usually called
    during the instance initialization phase before any gameplay logic begins.
  parameters:
  - name: creatureData
    description: Pointer to an array of ObjectData structures defining creature spawn
      information within the instance. Each entry typically contains a creature's
      GUID, spawn position, and other relevant metadata.
  - name: gameObjectData
    description: Pointer to an array of ObjectData structures defining game object
      spawn information within the instance. Each entry typically contains a game
      object's GUID, spawn position, and other relevant metadata.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Instance Data Loading
    code: "class ExampleInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    ExampleInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n\n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n \
      \       // Load creature and game object data for this instance\n        LoadObjectData(creatureData,\
      \ gameObjectData);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the initialization phase of an instance
    script. Developers should ensure that the ObjectData arrays passed to this method
    are properly defined and aligned with the instance's expected entities. The data
    structures must be static or persist for the lifetime of the instance script.
  warnings: Improperly formatted ObjectData arrays can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes during instance loading. Ensure all GUIDs referenced in the data exist
    within the database, otherwise runtime errors may occur when attempting to access
    non-existent entities.
