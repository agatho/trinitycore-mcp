documentation:
  brief: Consumes holy power from the resource manager, reducing the available holy
    power by one unit.
  description: The ConsumeHolyPower method is responsible for decrementing the holy
    power count within the ResourceManager. This method is typically invoked when
    a player or game entity uses an ability that requires holy power consumption.
    The operation reduces the internal holy power counter by one unit, and may trigger
    related events or updates depending on the implementation. It's commonly used
    in conjunction with abilities like Holy Shock, Word of Glory, or other holy-based
    spells that consume holy power. This method does not return any value and is designed
    to be a simple state modification operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void Player::UseHolyShock()\n{\n    if (resourceManager->GetHolyPower()\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        resourceManager->ConsumeHolyPower();\n        // Apply\
      \ holy shock effect\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Validation
    code: "void Player::CastHolyWord()\n{\n    if (resourceManager->GetHolyPower()\
      \ >= 3)\n    {\n        resourceManager->ConsumeHolyPower();\n        resourceManager->ConsumeHolyPower();\n\
      \        resourceManager->ConsumeHolyPower();\n        // Apply holy word effect\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when there is sufficient holy power available
    to avoid negative states. The ResourceManager class likely maintains a counter
    that tracks holy power, and this method modifies that counter directly without
    any external validation or event firing.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking if holy power is available may lead
    to unexpected behavior or invalid resource states. Ensure proper validation before
    calling this method in critical gameplay scenarios.
