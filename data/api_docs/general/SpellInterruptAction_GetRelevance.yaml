  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: GetRelevance
  signature: float SpellInterruptAction::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the relevance score of a spell interrupt action for
    bot AI decision making.
  description: The GetRelevance method calculates and returns a float value representing
    how relevant or important it is for a bot to perform a specific spell interrupt
    action. This relevance score is typically used by the AI system to prioritize
    actions, with higher scores indicating more urgent or beneficial interrupts. The
    method takes into account factors such as the threat level of the target, the
    type of spell being interrupted, and the bot's current combat state. It serves
    as a core component in the decision-making process for when and how a bot should
    interrupt enemy spellcasting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the relevance score. A value
    of 0.0 indicates no relevance (action should not be performed), while 1.0 represents
    maximum relevance (action should be prioritized). Values in between indicate varying
    degrees of importance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float relevance = interruptAction.GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.7f)\
      \ {\n    // Perform the spell interrupt action\n    ai->GetBot()->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_INTERRUPT_SPELL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using relevance to compare multiple actions
    code: "SpellInterruptAction* bestAction = nullptr;\nfloat bestRelevance = 0.0f;\n\
      \nfor (auto& action : interruptActions) {\n    float relevance = action.GetRelevance(ai);\n\
      \    if (relevance > bestRelevance) {\n        bestRelevance = relevance;\n\
      \        bestAction = &action;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestAction && bestRelevance\
      \ > 0.5f) {\n    // Execute the most relevant interrupt action\n    bestAction->Execute(ai);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs calculations based on current combat conditions,
    target threat levels, and spell properties. It may cache or precompute certain
    values for performance optimization. The exact implementation details depend on
    the specific AI logic and spell mechanics within TrinityCore's bot system.
  warnings: This method should only be called during active combat scenarios where
    interrupt actions are relevant. Calling it outside of combat may return inaccurate
    relevance scores or cause undefined behavior if the AI state is not properly initialized.
