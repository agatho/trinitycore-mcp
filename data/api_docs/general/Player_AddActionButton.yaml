    type)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new action button to the player's action bar.
  description: This method adds a new action button to the player's action bar at
    the specified button slot. The method allows players to add actions such as spells,
    items, or other game elements to their action bar. It returns a pointer to the
    newly created ActionButton object which can be used for further manipulation of
    the action button. This method is typically used during player initialization
    or when adding new abilities to the action bar.
  parameters:
  - name: button
    description: The button slot index where the action button will be placed (0-135).
  - name: action
    description: The action identifier (spell ID, item ID, etc.) to be added to the
      action bar.
  - name: type
    description: The type of action being added (0=spell, 1=item, 2=pet, etc.).
  returns: Returns a pointer to the ActionButton object that was created. If the operation
    fails, it returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      ActionButton* button = player->AddActionButton(0, 12345, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nuint8 buttonSlot = 1;\nuint64 actionId =\
      \ 54321;\nuint8 actionType = 1;\nActionButton* button = player->AddActionButton(buttonSlot,\
      \ actionId, actionType);\nif (button != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the button for\
      \ further operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method creates a new ActionButton object and adds it to the player's
    action bar. The action bar is typically initialized with 136 slots (0-135). This
    method should be used carefully as it may affect game balance and performance
    if used incorrectly.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or while the player is
    in an active state, as it may cause unexpected behavior. Also, care must be taken
    when using this method with invalid action IDs to avoid creating invalid action
    buttons.
