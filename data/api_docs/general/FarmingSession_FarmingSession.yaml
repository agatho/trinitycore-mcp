documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new farming session instance for managing player crop-related
    activities in the game world.
  description: The FarmingSession constructor initializes a new farming session object,
    setting up internal state variables and preparing the session to handle player
    interactions with crops, planting, harvesting, and related farming mechanics.
    This method is typically called when a player begins engaging with farming activities
    such as tending to gardens or managing farm plots. The constructor ensures that
    all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized before the
    session can be used for gameplay operations. It does not require any parameters
    as it sets up default values for session management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new farming session
    code: 'FarmingSession* session = new FarmingSession();

      // The session is now ready to manage player farming activities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when initializing a new farming session.
    It does not perform any validation or checks on external data since it's a simple
    initialization method. The actual farming mechanics are handled by other methods
    in the class.
