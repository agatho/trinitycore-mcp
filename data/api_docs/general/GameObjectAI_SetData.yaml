  method: SetData
  signature: void GameObjectAI::SetData(uint32 param0, uint32 param1)
documentation:
  brief: Sets data values for the game object AI, typically used to communicate state
    or configuration information.
  description: The SetData method in GameObjectAI is a virtual function designed to
    allow game object AI implementations to receive and process external data updates.
    This method serves as an interface for passing arbitrary uint32 parameters to
    the AI, enabling dynamic behavior changes or state synchronization based on events,
    quests, or other game systems. It is commonly invoked by triggers, scripts, or
    other game entities to communicate specific information to the object's AI handler.
    The implementation of this method is typically overridden in derived classes to
    define custom behavior when data is received.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: First parameter value that can represent any uint32 identifier or
      flag used to determine the type or context of the data being set.
  - name: param1
    description: Second parameter value that often represents a secondary data field,
      such as a value, state, or index associated with the first parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom GameObject AI
    code: "class MyGameObjectAI : public GameObjectAI {\npublic:\n    void SetData(uint32\
      \ param0, uint32 param1) override {\n        if (param0 == 1) {\n          \
      \  // Handle activation event\n            DoSomething();\n        } else if\
      \ (param0 == 2) {\n            // Handle deactivation event\n            DoSomethingElse();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a quest state flag
    code: "void SetData(uint32 param0, uint32 param1) override {\n    if (param0 ==\
      \ QUEST_STATE_FLAG && param1 == 1) {\n        // Mark quest as complete\n  \
      \      m_questComplete = true;\n        // Trigger visual effects or sound\n\
      \        SendGameObjectEvent();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the GameObjectAI virtual interface and must be overridden
    in derived classes to provide meaningful functionality. It is typically called
    from game events, scripts, or other systems that need to communicate state changes
    to a specific game object's AI handler.
  warnings: Ensure that param0 and param1 values are properly validated within the
    override implementation to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes. This method may
    be called frequently during gameplay, so performance considerations should be
    taken into account for complex logic.
