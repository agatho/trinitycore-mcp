  class: PositionUtils
  method: CalculatePositionAtAngle
  signature: int PositionUtils::CalculatePositionAtAngle(const int & center, float
    distance, float angle)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a new position at a specified distance and angle from a center
    point.
  description: The CalculatePositionAtAngle method computes a new coordinate position
    based on a given center point, distance, and angle. This utility is commonly used
    in game mechanics for determining positions relative to an object or location,
    such as calculating spawn points, projectile trajectories, or NPC movement patterns.
    The method takes into account the angular orientation and radial distance to return
    a calculated position. It's designed to work with coordinate systems typical of
    the TrinityCore framework and may be used in various gameplay scenarios including
    combat mechanics, area-of-effect calculations, and pathfinding algorithms.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The reference point from which the new position is calculated. This
      parameter represents a coordinate value (likely x or y) that serves as the center
      of the calculation.
  - name: distance
    description: The radial distance from the center point to the calculated position.
      Must be a non-negative floating-point value representing units in the game world.
  - name: angle
    description: The angular direction (in radians) from the center point to the calculated
      position. This angle is typically measured relative to a standard axis, such
      as the positive X-axis.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated coordinate position
    along the specified axis (either x or y). The exact meaning of this return value
    depends on how it's used in conjunction with other calculations within the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Position Calculation
    code: "int newX = PositionUtils::CalculatePositionAtAngle(100, 50.0f, 1.57f);\
      \ // Calculates position at 90 degrees (\u03C0/2 radians) from center point\
      \ 100 with distance 50"
    language: cpp
  - title: Projectile Trajectory Calculation
    code: int targetX = PositionUtils::CalculatePositionAtAngle(playerX, projectileDistance,
      playerFacingAngle); // Calculates where a projectile will land based on player's
      facing direction and distance
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the angle parameter is in radians. Developers should
    ensure that all input values are within valid ranges to avoid unexpected behavior
    or overflow conditions. The return value is an integer, so any fractional components
    of the calculated position may be truncated during conversion.
  warnings: "Be cautious when using large distance values as they might result in\
    \ coordinate overflow or invalid positions outside the expected game world boundaries.\
    \ Ensure that angle values are properly normalized if needed, especially when\
    \ dealing with angles beyond 2\u03C0 radians."
