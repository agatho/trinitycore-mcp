api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetPriceRange
  signature: std::pair<float, float> MarketAnalysis::GetPriceRange(uint32 itemId,
    float confidence)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the minimum and maximum price range for a specified item in the
    auction house market.
  description: The GetPriceRange method calculates and returns the estimated minimum
    and maximum prices for a given item based on current market data within the auction
    house system. This method is typically used by market analysis tools or trading
    bots to determine price trends and set competitive bids. The confidence parameter
    allows developers to adjust how aggressively the price range is calculated, with
    higher confidence values producing more conservative estimates. The returned pair
    represents the lower bound (first) and upper bound (second) of the expected price
    range for the specified item.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to analyze. This corresponds to
      the item's entry in the ItemTemplate database table.
  - name: confidence
    description: A floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines how conservative
      or aggressive the price range calculation should be. Higher values (closer to
      1.0) produce wider ranges, while lower values (closer to 0.0) produce tighter
      ranges.
  returns: A std::pair<float, float> where the first element is the minimum estimated
    price and the second element is the maximum estimated price for the specified
    item. Both values are represented as gold pieces (in copper units). Returns (0.0f,
    0.0f) if no market data is available for the item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      std::pair<float, float> range = analysis.GetPriceRange(18732, 0.75f);

      printf("Estimated price range: %f - %f gold\n", range.first / 10000.0f, range.second
      / 10000.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Different Confidence Levels
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      std::pair<float, float> lowConfidence = analysis.GetPriceRange(18732, 0.25f);

      std::pair<float, float> highConfidence = analysis.GetPriceRange(18732, 0.95f);

      printf("Low confidence range: %f - %f gold\n", lowConfidence.first / 10000.0f,
      lowConfidence.second / 10000.0f);

      printf("High confidence range: %f - %f gold\n", highConfidence.first / 10000.0f,
      highConfidence.second / 10000.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on historical auction data and may not reflect real-time
    market conditions. Performance is optimized for frequent calls but could be impacted
    by large datasets of item listings. The confidence parameter should be tuned based
    on desired risk tolerance in trading scenarios.
  warnings: This method might return zero values if no auction house data exists for
    the specified item, which could indicate either an invalid itemId or a very rare
    item with no current listings. Always validate the returned values before using
    them in price-sensitive operations.
