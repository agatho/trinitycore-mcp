  brief: Handles combat behavior when multiple enemies are present in the WarriorAI
    class
  description: The HandleMultipleEnemies method manages the AI's response to situations
    where a warrior character faces multiple opponents. This method typically adjusts
    the warrior's combat strategy, such as selecting optimal abilities, positioning,
    or targeting patterns based on the number of enemies detected. It is part of the
    general AI behavior system for warrior NPCs and players in TrinityCore, ensuring
    appropriate tactical responses during multi-target encounters. The method likely
    modifies internal state variables related to target selection, ability usage,
    and combat priority.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_creature->getVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        int enemyCount = GetNumberOfEnemies();\n        HandleMultipleEnemies(enemyCount);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during the AI update cycle and may interact
    with other combat-related methods such as target selection, ability casting, or
    threat management. The exact implementation details depend on the specific warrior
    class behavior defined in TrinityCore's AI framework.
