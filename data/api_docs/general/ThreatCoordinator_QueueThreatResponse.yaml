  method: QueueThreatResponse
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::QueueThreatResponse(const ThreatResponseAction
    & action)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a threat response action for processing by the threat coordinator.
  description: The QueueThreatResponse method adds a ThreatResponseAction to an internal
    queue for later execution. This method is typically used within the AI system
    to schedule threat-related actions such as aggro management, target switching,
    or threat reduction behaviors. The queued actions are processed in sequence by
    the threat coordinator's update loop, ensuring proper timing and coordination
    of threat responses. The method does not execute the action immediately but rather
    defers it for processing at an appropriate time during the next update cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The ThreatResponseAction object containing the threat response data
      to be queued for processing. This includes information about the type of threat
      response, target entity, and any associated parameters needed for execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Queuing a basic threat response
    code: "ThreatResponseAction action;\naction.Type = ThreatResponseType::THREAT_RESPONSE_TARGET_SWITCH;\n\
      action.TargetGUID = player->GetGUID();\naction.ThreatValue = 100.0f;\n\nThreatCoordinator*\
      \ coordinator = unit->GetThreatCoordinator();\nif (coordinator)\n{\n    coordinator->QueueThreatResponse(action);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    actual execution of queued threat responses occurs during the next update cycle
    of the threat coordinator, which typically happens during the creature's AI update
    loop.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or malformed ThreatResponseAction objects
    may lead to undefined behavior during processing. Ensure that all required fields
    in the action object are properly initialized before queuing.
