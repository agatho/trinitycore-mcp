documentation:
  brief: Returns the effect mask of the aura application, indicating which effects
    are active.
  description: The GetEffectMask method retrieves a bitmask that represents the active
    effects of an aura application. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    auras can have multiple effects (e.g., damage over time, stat bonuses, etc.),
    and each effect is assigned a bit in this mask. This allows systems to quickly
    determine which effects are currently applied without iterating through all possible
    effects. The returned value is typically used for optimization purposes, such
    as determining whether specific aura effects should be processed or updated during
    game ticks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 bitmask where each bit corresponds to an active aura effect. Bit
    positions represent different effect indices (0-31), with a set bit indicating
    that the corresponding effect is active on this aura application.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific aura effect is active
    code: "AuraApplication* app = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (app)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 effectMask = app->GetEffectMask();\n    if (effectMask & (1 << 0))\
      \ // Check if effect 0 is active\n    {\n        // Handle effect 0 logic\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The effect mask is typically generated and cached when the aura application
    is created or modified. It's important to note that this mask may not reflect
    real-time changes if the aura's effects are dynamically modified during its lifetime
    without proper recalculation of the mask.
  warnings: Be cautious when using bitwise operations on the returned mask; ensure
    you're checking against the correct bit positions as defined by the aura's effect
    indexing system. Also, avoid relying on this method for determining exact effect
    counts since multiple effects can be active simultaneously.
