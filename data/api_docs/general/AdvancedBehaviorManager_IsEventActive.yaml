  signature: bool AdvancedBehaviorManager::IsEventActive(WorldEventType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specified world event is currently active in the game environment.
  description: The IsEventActive method determines if a given world event, identified
    by its type, is currently active within the TrinityCore server. This functionality
    is essential for behavior scripts and AI systems that need to respond dynamically
    to ongoing events such as holidays, seasonal changes, or special in-game occurrences.
    The method performs a lookup against an internal registry of active events and
    returns a boolean value indicating the event's status. It does not modify any
    state and can be called safely from various contexts within the game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified WorldEventType is currently active; otherwise,
    returns false. This indicates whether the event conditions are met and the event
    is actively influencing the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Check
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsEventActive(WORLD_EVENT_HALLOWEEN))\n{\n    // Execute\
      \ Halloween-specific behavior\n    player->SendNotification(\"Halloween is active!\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on Event Status
    code: "if (behaviorManager.IsEventActive(WORLD_EVENT_WINTER_VEIL))\n{\n    //\
      \ Activate Winter Veil rewards or quests\n    npc->SetUInt32Value(UNIT_NPC_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Revert to normal NPC behavior\n\
      \    npc->SetUInt32Value(UNIT_NPC_FLAGS, 0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal event management system of TrinityCore.
    It is recommended to cache the result if checking the same event multiple times
    within a single update cycle for performance reasons. The method assumes that
    all world events are properly registered and managed by the server's event handler.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency loops or update functions,
    as repeated calls may impact performance. Also, ensure that the WorldEventType
    provided is valid and corresponds to an actual registered event, otherwise behavior
    may be unpredictable.
