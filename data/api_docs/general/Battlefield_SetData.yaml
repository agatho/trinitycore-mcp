  class: Battlefield
  method: SetData
  signature: void Battlefield::SetData(int dataId, int value)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal battlefield data with the specified identifier and value
  description: The SetData method is used to store or modify arbitrary integer data
    associated with a battlefield instance. This method allows the battlefield system
    to track various state variables, such as capture progress, player counts, or
    objective statuses. The dataId parameter serves as a unique key to identify what
    type of data is being set, while the value parameter holds the actual data to
    be stored. This functionality is essential for maintaining dynamic battlefield
    states that change during combat and objective progression.
  parameters:
  - name: dataId
    description: An integer identifier that specifies the type or category of data
      being set. This value acts as a key to distinguish different data fields within
      the battlefield system.
  - name: value
    description: The integer value to be stored for the specified data identifier.
      This can represent any numeric state information relevant to the battlefield's
      operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Capture Progress
    code: battlefield->SetData(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_CAPTURE_PROGRESS, 75);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Count
    code: 'battlefield->SetData(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_PLAYER_COUNT_ALLIANCE, alliancePlayers);

      battlefield->SetData(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_PLAYER_COUNT_HORDE, hordePlayers);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by internal battlefield systems during gameplay
    events. The data stored via SetData can be retrieved later using the corresponding
    GetData method. Implementations should ensure that dataId values are consistent
    across the battlefield's lifecycle to maintain proper state management.
