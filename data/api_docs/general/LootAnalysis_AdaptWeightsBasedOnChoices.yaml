  class: LootAnalysis
  method: AdaptWeightsBasedOnChoices
  signature: void LootAnalysis::AdaptWeightsBasedOnChoices(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts loot item weights based on player choices and preferences.
  description: The AdaptWeightsBasedOnChoices method modifies the weighting of loot
    items within the LootAnalysis system according to the player's recent choices
    and preferences. This method is typically invoked during loot distribution processes
    to ensure that players receive items that align with their selected preferences
    or previous selections, thereby improving the overall loot experience and personalization.
    It adjusts internal weight values used by the loot decision algorithm without
    directly modifying the item itself.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Loot Distribution
    code: "void HandleLootDistribution(Player* player)\n{\n    LootAnalysis analysis;\n\
      \    analysis.AdaptWeightsBasedOnChoices(player);\n    // Proceed with loot\
      \ decision using updated weights\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player preference data and may
    be called multiple times during a single loot session to refine item selection.
    It is part of a larger system that balances fairness, personalization, and game
    economy.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. The method modifies internal state and should not be called
    concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
