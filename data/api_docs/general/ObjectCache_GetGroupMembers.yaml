  method: GetGroupMembers
  signature: const int & ObjectCache::GetGroupMembers() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a reference to the internal collection of group member IDs stored
    within the ObjectCache instance.
  description: The GetGroupMembers method provides access to the cached list of group
    member identifiers associated with the object. This method returns a constant
    reference to an integer array or container that holds the GUIDs of players currently
    in the same group as the cached object. The returned reference allows for efficient
    read-only access to the group members without copying the data, which is particularly
    useful in performance-sensitive game systems where frequent group membership checks
    occur. This method is typically used by the TrinityCore server's group management
    and player tracking systems to quickly determine which players belong to a specific
    group.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer type representing the collection of
    group member IDs. The actual data structure is likely a container such as std::vector<int>
    or similar, containing unique identifiers (GUIDs) of players in the group. The
    returned reference ensures no copying occurs and maintains data consistency.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Group Members
    code: "const int& groupMembers = objectCache.GetGroupMembers();\n// Iterate through\
      \ group members\nfor (const auto& memberId : groupMembers)\n{\n    // Process\
      \ each member ID\n    std::cout << \"Member GUID: \" << memberId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a constant reference, meaning the caller cannot modify
    the underlying data. The returned reference is only valid while the ObjectCache
    instance exists and its internal data remains unchanged. If group membership changes,
    the cache must be updated accordingly to maintain consistency.
  warnings: Using this method without proper synchronization in multi-threaded environments
    may lead to race conditions if the group data is modified concurrently. Always
    ensure thread safety when accessing cached data that can change during runtime.
