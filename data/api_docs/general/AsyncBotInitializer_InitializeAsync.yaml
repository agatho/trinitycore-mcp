  class: AsyncBotInitializer
  method: InitializeAsync
  signature: bool AsyncBotInitializer::InitializeAsync(Player * bot, InitCallback
    callback)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a bot asynchronously with the provided callback function.
  description: The InitializeAsync method begins the asynchronous initialization process
    for a player bot, using the specified callback to handle completion or error states.
    This method is typically used in TrinityCore's AI and bot management systems where
    bots need to be set up without blocking the main game thread. The initialization
    may involve loading data, setting up AI behaviors, or configuring the bot's state.
    The callback function will be invoked once the initialization is complete or if
    an error occurs during the process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to be initialized.
      Must not be null.
  - name: callback
    description: Callback function of type InitCallback that will be executed upon
      completion or failure of the initialization process. The callback should handle
      the result of the async operation.
  returns: Returns true if the asynchronous initialization was successfully started,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates an immediate failure
    to initiate the async task.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of InitializeAsync
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nInitCallback\
      \ callback = [](bool success) {\n    if (success)\n        std::cout << \"Bot\
      \ initialized successfully\" << std::endl;\n    else\n        std::cout << \"\
      Bot initialization failed\" << std::endl;\n};\nbool result = initializer->InitializeAsync(myBot,\
      \ callback);\nif (!result)\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to start async initialization\"\
      \ << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for non-blocking operations and should not be called
    from the main game thread unless explicitly intended. The callback may be executed
    on a different thread depending on how the async system is implemented.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents
    an actual bot, not a regular player. Passing a null or invalid pointer can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes.
