  class: ScopedProfiler
  method: AddMetadata
  signature: void ScopedProfiler::AddMetadata(const std::string & key, const std::string
    & value)
documentation:
  brief: Adds metadata key-value pairs to the scoped profiler for tracking performance
    metrics.
  description: The AddMetadata method allows developers to associate arbitrary string-based
    key-value pairs with a ScopedProfiler instance. This functionality is primarily
    used for logging and debugging performance-related data within TrinityCore's profiling
    system. The metadata can include information such as zone names, player GUIDs,
    or specific operation identifiers that help correlate performance measurements
    with contextual data. The method does not validate the format of keys or values,
    so it's up to the caller to ensure meaningful and consistent usage. This is typically
    used in conjunction with other profiling methods to enrich the profiling data
    with additional context.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A string identifier used to label the metadata entry. Should be descriptive
      and unique enough to distinguish this piece of information from others.
  - name: value
    description: The string value associated with the key. Can contain any textual
      data relevant to the profiling context, such as identifiers or status information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling
    code: 'ScopedProfiler profiler("PlayerMovement");

      profiler.AddMetadata("PlayerGUID", "12345");

      profiler.AddMetadata("ZoneName", "Eastern Kingdoms");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Metadata for Debugging
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player) {\n    ScopedProfiler profiler(\"\
      PlayerLogin\");\n    profiler.AddMetadata(\"AccountID\", std::to_string(player->GetSession()->GetAccountId()));\n\
      \    profiler.AddMetadata(\"CharacterName\", player->GetName());\n    // ...\
      \ login logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The metadata added via this method is intended for debugging and logging
    purposes. It's not directly used in performance calculations but serves as contextual
    information that can be extracted from profiling reports. The method is lightweight
    and does not perform any complex operations, making it safe to call frequently
    during profiling sessions.
  warnings: Ensure that keys and values are properly escaped or sanitized if they
    contain special characters that might interfere with logging systems. Repeatedly
    adding metadata with the same key may lead to confusion in log analysis unless
    intentionally used for tracking changes over time.
