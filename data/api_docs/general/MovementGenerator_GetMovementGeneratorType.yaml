  class: MovementGenerator
  method: GetMovementGeneratorType
  signature: MovementGeneratorType MovementGenerator::GetMovementGeneratorType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the movement generator instance.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method returns the MovementGeneratorType
    enumeration value that uniquely identifies the specific type of movement generator
    this instance represents. This is used internally by the game engine to determine
    how to process and execute different types of movement behaviors for units such
    as players, creatures, or game objects. The returned value corresponds to predefined
    movement generator types like IDLE, RANDOM, WAYPOINT, CHASE, etc., which dictate
    the movement logic applied to the associated unit. This method is typically called
    during movement processing loops to dispatch appropriate movement behavior based
    on the generator type.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A MovementGeneratorType enumeration value indicating the specific type
    of movement generator this instance represents. Possible values include but are
    not limited to: IDLE, RANDOM, WAYPOINT, CHASE, FLEE, CONFUSED, ESCORT, HOME, TARGET_POSITION,
    and others defined in the MovementGeneratorType enum.'
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "MovementGenerator* mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      MovementGeneratorType type = mg->GetMovementGeneratorType();\nif (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_CHASE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle chase movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure virtual function in the base MovementGenerator class,
    meaning each derived movement generator must implement its own version to return
    the appropriate type. The returned value should be consistent throughout the lifetime
    of the movement generator instance.
