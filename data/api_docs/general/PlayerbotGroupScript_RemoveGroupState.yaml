  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: RemoveGroupState
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::RemoveGroupState(int groupGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the specified group state from the player bot group script.
  description: The RemoveGroupState method is used to remove a specific group state
    associated with a given group GUID from the PlayerbotGroupScript. This method
    likely manages internal tracking of group states within the player bot system,
    allowing for proper cleanup or state transitions when groups are disbanded or
    modified. The method operates on the group identifier provided as a parameter
    and performs necessary internal operations to ensure that the specified group
    state is no longer tracked or referenced by the script.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group whose state should be removed.
      This value typically represents a group in the World of Warcraft instance and
      is used to locate and manage specific group states within the player bot system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Group State Example
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupScript* groupScript = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupScript();

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      groupScript->RemoveGroupState(groupId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal state management system for player
    bots in TrinityCore. It may be called automatically during group disbanding or
    when transitioning between different group configurations. Developers should ensure
    that the provided group GUID is valid and corresponds to an existing group before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent group GUID could lead
    to undefined behavior or internal inconsistencies in the player bot system. Ensure
    proper validation of the group GUID before invoking this method.
