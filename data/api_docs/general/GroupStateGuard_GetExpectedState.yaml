  class: GroupStateGuard
  method: GetExpectedState
  signature: GroupState GroupStateGuard::GetExpectedState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the expected group state that the GroupStateGuard is managing.
  description: The GetExpectedState method returns the anticipated state of a group
    as tracked by the GroupStateGuard. This guard mechanism is typically used in TrinityCore's
    group management system to ensure consistency and handle state transitions properly
    during group operations such as member additions, removals, or leadership changes.
    The returned GroupState represents what the group's state should be according
    to the guard's internal tracking, which can be useful for validating current group
    status or determining next steps in group-related logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupState enum value representing the expected state of the group managed
    by this guard. The specific values depend on the implementation but generally
    indicate whether the group is in a normal, pending, or transitioning state.
  examples:
  - title: Check Expected Group State
    code: "GroupStateGuard guard;\n// ... some group operations ...\nGroupState expected\
      \ = guard.GetExpectedState();\nif (expected == GroupState::GROUP_STATE_NORMAL)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with normal group operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore group system
    and should not be called directly in most user-facing code. The GroupStateGuard
    is designed to maintain consistency between different parts of the group subsystem,
    particularly during asynchronous operations.
