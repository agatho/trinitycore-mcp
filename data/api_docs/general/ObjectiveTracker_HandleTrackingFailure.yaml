  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: HandleTrackingFailure
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::HandleTrackingFailure(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 objectiveIndex, const std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Handles quest tracking failure for a player by logging the error and updating
    the objective tracker state.
  description: The HandleTrackingFailure method is responsible for managing cases
    where a quest objective tracking operation fails. It takes in details about the
    bot player, the quest ID, the specific objective index that failed, and an error
    message describing why the tracking failed. This method ensures proper logging
    of tracking failures and updates internal state to reflect that the specified
    objective could not be tracked successfully. The method is typically invoked when
    a quest objective cannot be monitored due to various reasons such as invalid quest
    data, missing objectives, or system errors during tracking initialization.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that encountered
      the tracking failure. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which tracking failed. Should
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest that failed to track.
      Zero-based index, must be less than the total number of objectives in the quest.
  - name: error
    description: String describing the reason for tracking failure. Used for logging
      and debugging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker tracker;

      Player* bot = ...; // valid player pointer

      tracker.HandleTrackingFailure(bot, 12345, 0, "Invalid quest data");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the objective tracking system in TrinityCore and is
    typically called internally by quest management systems when tracking operations
    fail. It does not directly modify player state but rather logs the failure for
    debugging purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is valid and not null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The questId and objectiveIndex should be validated
    to prevent out-of-bounds access.
