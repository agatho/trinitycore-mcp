  method: GetQuestSlotEndTime
  signature: int64 Player::GetQuestSlotEndTime(uint16 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the end time of a quest slot in milliseconds since epoch.
  description: This method retrieves the end time for a specific quest slot on the
    player's quest log. It returns the timestamp in milliseconds since Unix epoch
    (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) when the quest slot will expire or become available
    again. The method is typically used to determine when a quest becomes available
    for completion or re-completion after its cooldown period has ended. This functionality
    is essential for managing quest timers and ensuring proper game progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int64 value representing the timestamp in milliseconds since
    epoch when the quest slot will expire or become available again. A value of 0
    indicates that no timer exists for the specified quest slot, meaning the quest
    is either not active or has already completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int64 end_time = player->GetQuestSlotEndTime(0);\nif (end_time > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Quest slot has a timer\n    // Process the time accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may involve accessing internal
    quest data structures. The returned value represents Unix timestamps and can be
    converted to readable date format using standard time conversion methods. Performance
    considerations include checking for valid quest slot ranges before calling this
    method.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid quest slots, as it may
    return zero values indicating no timer exists. Also, avoid calling this method
    during quest completion or cooldown periods as it might not reflect the actual
    current state of the quest.
