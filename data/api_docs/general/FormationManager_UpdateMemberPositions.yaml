  signature: void FormationManager::UpdateMemberPositions()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the positions of all members in a formation based on their leader's
    current location and formation data.
  description: The UpdateMemberPositions method recalculates and applies new positions
    to all units that are part of a formation, ensuring they maintain their designated
    formation offsets relative to the formation's leader. This method is typically
    invoked when the leader moves or when formation parameters change, and it handles
    the synchronization of unit positions in the world. The method operates on the
    internal formation data structure and updates each member's position accordingly,
    taking into account the leader's current location, orientation, and formation
    settings such as spacing and angle offsets. It does not directly interact with
    the game world's physics engine but rather manages the logical positioning of
    units within a formation.

  - title: Basic Usage in Formation Update Loop
    code: "void UpdateFormation()\n{\n    if (formationManager && formationManager->HasMembers())\n\
      \    {\n        formationManager->UpdateMemberPositions();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called from within the formation's update loop or
    when a leader's position changes. It assumes that all members in the formation
    have valid formation data and that the leader's position is up-to-date. The method
    does not perform any checks for unit validity or formation state, so it should
    only be called when the formation is in a consistent state.
