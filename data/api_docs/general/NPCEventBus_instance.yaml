documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the NPCEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the NPCEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the event bus exists throughout the
    application. This method is used to access the global event bus responsible for
    handling NPC-related events and communication within the TrinityCore framework.
    The returned pointer should be used directly without attempting to delete or manage
    its lifetime, as it is managed internally by the singleton implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of NPCEventBus. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton ensures instantiation on first access.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the NPCEventBus singleton
    code: "NPCEventBus* eventBus = NPCEventBus::instance();\n// Use eventBus to register\
      \ event handlers or dispatch events\nif (eventBus)\n{\n    // Perform operations\
      \ with the event bus\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in most implementations of singleton patterns
    used in TrinityCore. The instance is created on first call and persists for the
    lifetime of the application. Developers should not attempt to create additional
    instances or manage the memory of the returned pointer.
  warnings: Do not delete or manually destroy the returned pointer as it's managed
    by the singleton pattern. Avoid calling this method from destructors or during
    static initialization phases where the singleton might not be fully initialized
    yet.
