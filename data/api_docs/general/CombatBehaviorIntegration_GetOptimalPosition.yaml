  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int CombatBehaviorIntegration::GetOptimalPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning value for combat behavior
    integration.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the most advantageous position
    for a unit within a combat scenario, taking into account factors such as distance
    to target, threat level, and environmental obstacles. This method is typically
    used by AI-controlled entities to make tactical decisions regarding movement and
    positioning during encounters. The returned integer value represents a normalized
    score that indicates how optimal the current position is for effective combat
    engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated optimal position score. Higher
    values indicate better positioning for combat effectiveness, while lower values
    suggest suboptimal positioning that may require adjustment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "class MyCombatAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateCombatPosition() {\n      \
      \  int optimalPos = combatBehavior.GetOptimalPosition();\n        if (optimalPos\
      \ < 50) {\n            // Move to a better position\n            MoveToOptimalLocation();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations involving distance metrics, threat
    assessment, and environmental analysis. It should be called periodically during
    combat updates rather than on every frame to maintain performance. The exact scoring
    algorithm may vary based on the specific combat behavior implementation.
  warnings: The returned position score is relative and context-dependent. Do not
    assume absolute positioning values without considering the broader combat state.
    Calling this method in high-frequency loops without proper throttling may impact
    performance.
