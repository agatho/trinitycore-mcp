  method: UpdateHolyState
  signature: void HolyPriestRefactored::UpdateHolyState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the holy state of the priest, managing aura application and spell
    casting behavior.
  description: 'The UpdateHolyState method is responsible for managing the current
    holy state of a Holy Priest character within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    typically handles the logic for applying or removing holy auras, updating spell
    cooldowns, and ensuring proper state synchronization between the priest''s abilities
    and game mechanics. It may also control the activation or deactivation of holy-based
    abilities such as Power Word: Shield, Prayer of Mending, or other holy spell effects
    based on internal state conditions. The method is generally called during AI update
    cycles to maintain consistent behavior and ensure that the priest''s holy abilities
    are functioning according to game rules.'

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_holyStateTimer <= diff)\n    {\n        m_holyStateTimer = 1000;\
      \ // Reset timer\n        m_priest->UpdateHolyState();\n    }\n    else\n  \
      \  {\n        m_holyStateTimer -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system during regular update cycles.
    It's important to note that this method may have side effects on spell casting
    or aura management, so calling it at inappropriate times could lead to inconsistent
    behavior. The method likely interacts with internal state variables such as spell
    cooldowns, aura stacks, and holy power resources.
  warnings: Calling UpdateHolyState outside of the intended AI update context might
    cause unexpected behavior or resource synchronization issues. Ensure that this
    method is only called when the priest's state requires updating to avoid performance
    degradation or game logic errors.
