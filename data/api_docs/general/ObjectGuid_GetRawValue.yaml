documentation:
  brief: Returns the raw 16-byte array representation of the ObjectGuid.
  description: The GetRawValue method retrieves the internal 16-byte binary representation
    of an ObjectGuid. This method is typically used when interfacing with low-level
    systems or network protocols that require direct byte access to the GUID. The
    returned std::array<uint8, 16> preserves the exact byte layout of the GUID as
    stored internally, making it suitable for serialization, hashing, or comparison
    operations at the byte level. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, ObjectGuids
    are used extensively to uniquely identify game objects, players, creatures, and
    other entities within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::array<uint8, 16> containing the raw 16-byte representation of the
    ObjectGuid. Each byte in the array corresponds to a specific part of the GUID's
    internal structure, including type information, counter values, and server identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve raw GUID bytes
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      std::array<uint8, 16> rawBytes = guid.GetRawValue();

      // rawBytes now contains the 16-byte representation of the player GUID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using raw GUID bytes for comparison or hashing
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid1 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(54321);

      ObjectGuid guid2 = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(54321);

      std::array<uint8, 16> bytes1 = guid1.GetRawValue();

      std::array<uint8, 16> bytes2 = guid2.GetRawValue();

      bool areEqual = (bytes1 == bytes2); // True if GUIDs are identical'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is a copy of the internal representation and can be safely
    used without modifying the original ObjectGuid. The byte order follows the system's
    native endianness, which may affect cross-platform compatibility when serializing
    GUIDs for network transmission.
