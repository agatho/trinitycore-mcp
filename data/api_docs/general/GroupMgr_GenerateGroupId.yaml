  class: GroupMgr
  method: GenerateGroupId
  signature: int GroupMgr::GenerateGroupId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique group identifier for use in World of Warcraft
    player groups.
  description: The GenerateGroupId method is responsible for creating a new, unique
    identifier that can be used to identify player groups within the TrinityCore framework.
    This identifier is typically used when forming or managing guilds, raid groups,
    or other organized player entities in the game world. The method ensures that
    each generated ID is distinct from previously generated IDs to prevent conflicts
    in group management systems. It operates as part of the GroupMgr class which handles
    all group-related operations and state management within the core. This method
    does not perform any validation on existing group IDs, assuming the system maintains
    a consistent generation mechanism.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the newly generated unique group identifier.
    The returned value is guaranteed to be positive and unique within the current
    server session, though the specific range or maximum value is implementation-dependent.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group ID Generation
    code: 'GroupMgr* groupManager = sGroupMgr;

      int newGroupId = groupManager->GenerateGroupId();

      // Use newGroupId to create a new player group

      printf("Generated Group ID: %d\n", newGroupId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core when creating new
    groups, but may also be invoked directly by modules that need to generate custom
    group identifiers. The implementation likely uses an internal counter or database-based
    approach to ensure uniqueness. Developers should note that this method does not
    persist the generated ID to any storage system - it only generates and returns
    the value.
  warnings: This method should not be used for generating persistent identifiers that
    must survive server restarts, as the generated IDs are typically ephemeral and
    may reset upon server reload or restart. Additionally, calling this method in
    high-frequency scenarios without proper synchronization could potentially lead
    to race conditions if multiple threads attempt to generate IDs simultaneously.
