  class: LoSUtils
  method: DoLinesIntersect
  signature: bool LoSUtils::DoLinesIntersect(const int & line1Start, const int & line1End,
    const int & line2Start, const int & line2End)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two line segments intersect in 2D space.
  description: The DoLinesIntersect method calculates if two line segments, defined
    by their start and end points, intersect each other. This utility function is
    commonly used in game mechanics such as line-of-sight checks, spell targeting,
    or collision detection. The method operates on integer coordinates and uses a
    standard computational geometry algorithm to determine intersection. It assumes
    that the input parameters represent valid line segment endpoints and does not
    perform validation on them.
  parameters:
  - name: line1Start
    description: The starting point of the first line segment (x-coordinate).
  - name: line1End
    description: The ending point of the first line segment (x-coordinate).
  - name: line2Start
    description: The starting point of the second line segment (x-coordinate).
  - name: line2End
    description: The ending point of the second line segment (x-coordinate).
  returns: Returns true if the two line segments intersect, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line Intersection Check
    code: "bool result = LoSUtils::DoLinesIntersect(0, 5, 2, 7); // Checks if lines\
      \ from (0,0) to (5,0) and (2,0) to (7,0) intersect\nif (result)\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Lines intersect!\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only handles x-coordinates as specified in the signature. For
    full 2D line intersection, both x and y coordinates should be considered. The
    implementation uses integer arithmetic which may lead to precision issues with
    floating-point values.
  warnings: The method does not validate input parameters for correctness or range.
    Passing invalid coordinates might result in undefined behavior. Also, note that
    this function only checks for intersection along the x-axis; for true 2D line
    intersection, additional y-coordinate handling is required.
