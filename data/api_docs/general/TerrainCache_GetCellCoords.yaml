    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the cell coordinates for a given position within the
    terrain cache.
  description: The GetCellCoords method converts a world position coordinate into
    corresponding cell coordinates used by the TerrainCache system. This is essential
    for efficiently managing and accessing terrain data in chunks, where each chunk
    represents a specific area of the game world. The method takes an integer position
    value (typically representing either X or Y coordinate) and maps it to a cell
    index within the cache grid. Cell coordinates are used internally by the terrain
    system to determine which cached data blocks should be accessed for terrain queries,
    rendering, or collision detection. This mapping ensures that large world coordinates
    are translated into manageable indices suitable for array-based storage and lookup
    operations.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position coordinate (typically X or Y) to convert into cell coordinates.
      This is an integer value representing a position in the game world's coordinate
      system.
  returns: A std::pair<uint32, uint32> where the first element represents the X cell
    coordinate and the second element represents the Y cell coordinate. Both values
    are unsigned 32-bit integers indicating the grid position within the terrain cache.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for getting cell coordinates from a position
    code: 'int playerX = 12345;

      std::pair<uint32, uint32> cellCoords = terrainCache.GetCellCoords(playerX);

      // Returns the X and Y cell indices for the given world coordinate'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using cell coordinates to access cached terrain data
    code: 'int playerX = 12345;

      int playerY = 67890;

      std::pair<uint32, uint32> cellCoordsX = terrainCache.GetCellCoords(playerX);

      std::pair<uint32, uint32> cellCoordsY = terrainCache.GetCellCoords(playerY);

      // Use these coordinates to index into terrain cache arrays or grids'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the terrain cache uses a fixed grid size where each
    cell represents a specific area of the world. The exact mapping from world coordinates
    to cell indices depends on the internal configuration of the TerrainCache system,
    typically involving division by a predefined cell size constant. This method is
    commonly used in conjunction with other terrain cache operations such as GetTerrainData
    or CheckCellAvailability.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid position values that fall
    within the supported world coordinate range. Invalid coordinates may result in
    incorrect cell indices or out-of-bounds access if not properly validated before
    use.
