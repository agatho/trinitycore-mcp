  signature: int InstanceCoordination::CalculateOptimalRoute(Group * group, const
    int & objectives)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal route for a group to complete instance
    objectives.
  description: The CalculateOptimalRoute method determines the most efficient path
    for a player group to complete specified instance objectives. It evaluates various
    factors such as objective locations, group member positions, and instance layout
    to compute an optimized sequence of actions. This method is typically used in
    dungeon or raid coordination systems to minimize travel time and resource usage.
    The method requires a valid Group object and a set of objectives to process. The
    return value indicates success or failure of the route calculation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group for which
      the optimal route is calculated. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active
      group.
  - name: objectives
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the objectives to be completed.
      The specific meaning and encoding of this value depends on the instance type
      and objective system implementation.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the route
    calculation. A positive value typically indicates successful calculation, while
    a negative value may indicate errors such as invalid group state or unprocessable
    objectives.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Route Calculation
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nint objectives = 0x0001; // Example\
      \ objective bitmask\nint result = instanceCoordination->CalculateOptimalRoute(myGroup,\
      \ objectives);\nif (result > 0) {\n    // Route calculation successful\n   \
      \ // Proceed with group movement based on calculated route\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Route Calculation
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (!raidGroup) {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid group case\n    return;\n}\nint objectives = 0x000F; // Multiple objectives\n\
      int routeResult = instanceCoordination->CalculateOptimalRoute(raidGroup, objectives);\n\
      switch (routeResult) {\n    case -1: // Invalid group\n        // Log error\
      \ and notify player\n        break;\n    case -2: // Invalid objectives\n  \
      \      // Handle objective processing error\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Process successful route\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger instance coordination system that
    manages group movement and objective completion. The implementation may involve
    pathfinding algorithms and consideration of instance-specific constraints. Performance
    can be affected by the number of objectives and group size. The method should
    only be called when the group is in a valid state for coordination.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid Group pointer will likely cause
    undefined behavior or crashes. The objectives parameter must be properly encoded
    according to the instance's objective system. This method may not be thread-safe
    and should only be called from the main game thread or appropriate synchronization
    context.
