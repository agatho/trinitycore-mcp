documentation:
  brief: Rename a trait configuration for the player.
  description: This method allows a player to rename an existing trait configuration
    by specifying its ID and providing a new name. The trait configuration is typically
    used in character customization or talent trees, where players can modify their
    trait points allocation. This operation affects the player's trait configuration
    settings within the game world, enabling customization of their character's trait
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: editedConfigId
    description: The unique identifier of the trait configuration to be renamed. This
      ID corresponds to a specific trait configuration in the player's trait system.
  - name: newName
    description: The new name to assign to the trait configuration. This must be a
      valid string that represents the desired name for the configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RenameTraitConfig(12345, "NewTraitName");'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely updates the trait configuration in the database or memory,
    and requires proper validation of the new name to ensure it meets game requirements.
    This operation may be subject to cooldowns or restrictions depending on game mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be used with invalid IDs or names that are too
    long or contain special characters that might cause issues in the database. Also,
    renaming a trait configuration may affect gameplay balance if used incorrectly.
