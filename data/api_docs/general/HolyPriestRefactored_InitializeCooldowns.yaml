documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for all holy priest abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and resets the cooldown tracking
    for all abilities available to the Holy Priest class. This method is typically
    called during spell initialization or when a new instance of the HolyPriestRefactored
    class is created. It ensures that all spells start with their correct cooldown
    states, preventing unintended immediate usage of abilities after a character loads
    or respawns. The method handles both standard and special cooldowns, including
    those related to mana regeneration, divine cast time reductions, and other priest-specific
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'HolyPriestRefactored priest;

      priest.InitializeCooldowns();

      // Cooldowns are now initialized for all holy priest abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during object initialization to avoid
    resetting active cooldowns. The implementation likely uses internal data structures
    to track spell cooldowns and may interact with TrinityCore's spell system to ensure
    proper synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during gameplay can cause unexpected
    behavior, such as incorrectly resetting active cooldowns or interfering with the
    game state. It should not be invoked during active combat unless specifically
    designed for reset purposes.
