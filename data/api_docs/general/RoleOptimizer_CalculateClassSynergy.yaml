documentation:
  brief: Calculates the synergy score between different class roles in a group context.
  description: The CalculateClassSynergy method evaluates how well different class
    roles work together within a group setting. This method is typically used in group
    composition analysis, raid planning, or role optimization systems to determine
    the effectiveness of a particular combination of player classes and their assigned
    roles. The synergy score reflects the overall benefit or efficiency gained from
    the specific pairing or grouping of class roles, which can be crucial for optimizing
    performance in challenging content such as raids or dungeons. This method does
    not modify any internal state and is designed to provide a static analysis of
    role compatibility.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated synergy score between class roles.
    Higher values indicate better role compatibility and group effectiveness, while
    lower values suggest potential issues with the role distribution or class combinations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Synergy Calculation
    code: "RoleOptimizer optimizer;\nfloat synergy = optimizer.CalculateClassSynergy();\n\
      if (synergy > 0.8f) {\n    // Group composition is highly effective\n    printf(\"\
      Excellent group synergy: %.2f\\n\", synergy);\n} else if (synergy > 0.5f) {\n\
      \    // Moderate synergy\n    printf(\"Average group synergy: %.2f\\n\", synergy);\n\
      } else {\n    // Poor synergy, consider reevaluation\n    printf(\"Low group\
      \ synergy: %.2f\\n\", synergy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses predefined weights or rules based on class interactions
    and role requirements. It may be called frequently during group formation or composition
    analysis, so performance optimization is important. The exact algorithm for calculating
    synergy is not specified in the signature but would typically involve evaluating
    role dependencies, resource sharing, and combat effectiveness.
  warnings: Ensure that the classRolePairs parameter is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized data could lead to unpredictable
    results. This method should only be called when group composition data is valid
    to avoid misleading synergy scores.
