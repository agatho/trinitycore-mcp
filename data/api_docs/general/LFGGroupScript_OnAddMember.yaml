  signature: void LFGGroupScript::OnAddMember(Group * group, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a player is added to a LFG group
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore LFG (Looking for Group) system
    whenever a player is successfully added to a group. It serves as a hook for custom
    scripts to execute logic when group membership changes occur. The method provides
    access to both the group object and the GUID of the player being added, allowing
    for detailed tracking and modification of group behavior during LFG operations.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that the player is being added to. This
      represents the current LFG group state.
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being added to the group.
      Used for identifying the specific player in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic LFG Group Member Addition Handler
    code: "class MyLFGScript : public LFGGroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyLFGScript()\
      \ : LFGGroupScript(\"MyLFGScript\") {}\n\n    void OnAddMember(Group* group,\
      \ uint64 guid) override\n    {\n        // Log when a player joins an LFG group\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Player with GUID %u was added to LFG group.\", guid);\n\
      \        \n        // Example: Update group leader if needed\n        if (group\
      \ && group->GetLeaderGUID() == 0)\n        {\n            group->SetLeader(guid);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system's scripting interface and is typically
    used to implement custom behavior when players join LFG groups. The group object
    passed in may not yet be fully initialized, so care should be taken when accessing
    group properties. This hook is called after the player has been successfully added
    to the group but before any further LFG processing occurs.
  warnings: Do not modify the group structure directly within this method unless absolutely
    necessary, as it could cause race conditions or inconsistent state. Avoid performing
    heavy operations in this callback as it may affect LFG performance. Be cautious
    when using player GUIDs without verifying their validity first.
