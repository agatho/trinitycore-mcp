documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the target assist action can be executed by a bot AI.
  description: The IsPossible method evaluates if the current conditions allow for
    the target assist action to be performed. This typically checks if there is a
    valid target available, if the bot has sufficient resources or permissions, and
    if the action aligns with the bot's current state or behavior rules. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this method helps prevent invalid actions from being
    queued or executed, ensuring that bots behave logically within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target assist action can be safely executed under current
    conditions; otherwise returns false.
