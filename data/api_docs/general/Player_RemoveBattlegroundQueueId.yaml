documentation:
  brief: Removes a battleground queue ID from the player's queue list.
  description: This method removes a specific battleground queue ID from the player's
    active battleground queue list. It is used to remove a queued battleground entry
    when the player is no longer participating in that particular battleground, typically
    after leaving or canceling the queue. The method ensures that the player's queue
    list is properly updated and prevents duplicate entries in the battleground queue
    system.

    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveBattlegroundQueueId(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when a player leaves a battleground queue, typically
    after a successful cancellation or when the player is removed from the queue due
    to timeout. The method ensures that internal queue tracking is properly maintained
    and prevents potential issues with duplicate queue entries.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method, as removing a queue ID that
    does not exist in the player's queue list may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    queue tracking. Ensure that the queue ID exists before calling this method.
