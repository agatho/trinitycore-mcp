  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: HasHealingAbilities
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::HasHealingAbilities() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the group coordinator has any healing abilities available.
  description: The HasHealingAbilities method checks if the group coordinator, typically
    a player character in a group or raid, possesses any healing abilities such as
    spells, abilities, or items that can restore health to other players. This method
    is commonly used in group coordination systems, particularly for determining role
    assignments in dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds where healing support is required.
    The check considers active abilities and cooldown states to accurately reflect
    the availability of healing capabilities at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group coordinator has at least one healing ability
    available; otherwise returns false. This includes both passive and active healing
    abilities, such as healing spells, healing potions, or class-specific healing
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "if (groupCoordinator->HasHealingAbilities()) {\n    // Assign coordinator\
      \ to a healing role\n    group->SetRole(GroupRole::HEALER);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Look for another healer in the group\n    group->FindAndAssignHealer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform checks against a character's current spellbook, equipped
    items, and active cooldowns. It is recommended to cache the result if the check
    is performed frequently in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: The method does not account for temporary buffs or debuffs that might
    alter healing effectiveness; it only evaluates the base availability of healing
    abilities.
