  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: ValidateConstraints
  signature: bool RoleOptimizer::ValidateConstraints(const int & assignments, const
    int & players, const OptimizationConstraints & constraints)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the given role assignments meet the specified optimization
    constraints.
  description: The ValidateConstraints method checks if a set of role assignments
    for players adheres to the defined optimization constraints. This method is typically
    used in group composition systems, such as those found in World of Warcraft's
    raid and dungeon finding tools, where specific roles (like tank, healer, damage
    dealer) must be assigned according to certain rules or limits. It ensures that
    the distribution of roles among players satisfies all constraint requirements
    before proceeding with further optimization logic.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: An integer representing the current role assignments for players.
      This value typically encodes the assignment information in a bitmask or similar
      compact form, where each bit or group of bits corresponds to a specific player's
      assigned role.
  - name: players
    description: An integer indicating the total number of players involved in the
      role assignment process. This parameter defines the scope of the validation
      and is used to determine how many roles should be checked against the constraints.
  - name: constraints
    description: A reference to an OptimizationConstraints object that contains the
      rules or limits that must be satisfied by the assignments. These constraints
      might include minimum/maximum role counts, role exclusivity requirements, or
      other group composition rules.
  returns: Returns true if all the role assignments comply with the provided optimization
    constraints; otherwise, returns false. A return value of false indicates that
    at least one constraint has been violated by the given assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Example
    code: 'OptimizationConstraints constraints;

      constraints.minTanks = 1;

      constraints.maxHealers = 3;

      int assignments = 0b11001; // Example bitmask

      int players = 5;

      bool isValid = roleOptimizer.ValidateConstraints(assignments, players, constraints);

      // isValid will be true if the assignments satisfy all constraints'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Validation with Multiple Constraints
    code: 'OptimizationConstraints constraints;

      constraints.minTanks = 1;

      constraints.maxHealers = 2;

      constraints.minDPS = 3;

      constraints.roleExclusions = {Role::Tank, Role::Healer}; // Cannot have both
      tank and healer roles

      int assignments = 0b10101; // Example bitmask with valid distribution

      int players = 5;

      bool isValid = roleOptimizer.ValidateConstraints(assignments, players, constraints);

      // isValid will be true if all constraints are met'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the assignments parameter is properly formatted
    and represents a valid set of role assignments. The OptimizationConstraints object
    should be pre-configured with appropriate values before calling this method. Performance-wise,
    this method performs a series of checks on the assignments against the constraints,
    so it may become more expensive as the number of constraints increases.
  warnings: Ensure that the assignments integer accurately reflects the current state
    of role distribution among players. Incorrectly formatted assignments can lead
    to false validation results. Also, be cautious when using large numbers of players
    or complex constraint sets, as this could impact performance.
