  brief: Adds a transmogrification block to the player's inventory.
  description: This method adds a transmog block (transmogrification item) to the
    player's inventory, allowing them to use it for transmogrifying equipment. The
    block value represents the specific transmog item that will be added to the player's
    collection. This method is typically used in conjunction with other transmog-related
    functions to manage player's transmog collections and ensure proper game mechanics
    are maintained.

  notes: The method is part of the transmogrification system and should be used carefully
    to maintain game balance. It's recommended to check if the player already has
    this block before adding it to avoid duplicates.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as adding duplicate blocks can cause
    issues with game mechanics and may lead to unexpected behavior in the player's
    inventory.
