documentation:
  brief: Invites queued players to join the battlefield war.
  description: The InvitePlayersInQueueToWar method is responsible for inviting players
    who are currently in the queue for a battlefield to actually participate in the
    ongoing battle. This method typically gets called when the battlefield is ready
    to start and there are enough queued players to form teams. It handles the process
    of removing players from the queue and adding them to the active battlefield instance,
    ensuring they are properly positioned and notified about their participation.
    The method may also perform necessary checks to ensure that the battlefield has
    not exceeded its maximum player capacity and that all queued players meet the
    required level or faction criteria.

  - title: Basic Usage in Battlefield Update Loop
    code: "void Battlefield::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic\
      \ ...\n    if (m_isActive && m_queue.size() >= m_minPlayersPerTeam)\n    {\n\
      \        InvitePlayersInQueueToWar();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the battlefield's update cycle when
    conditions are met for starting a battle. It assumes that the battlefield has
    already validated that there are sufficient players in queue and that the necessary
    preconditions for battle initiation have been satisfied.
