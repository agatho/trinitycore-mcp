  class: SplineChainMovementGenerator
  method: Finalize
  signature: void SplineChainMovementGenerator::Finalize(Unit * param0, bool param1,
    bool param2)
documentation:
  brief: Completes the spline chain movement generation process by cleaning up resources
    and finalizing the movement state.
  description: The Finalize method in SplineChainMovementGenerator is responsible
    for completing the movement generation process for a unit that is following a
    spline-based path. It ensures proper cleanup of internal resources, resets movement
    state flags, and prepares the unit for subsequent movement operations. This method
    is typically invoked when the movement chain has been fully processed or when
    an interruption occurs during the execution of the spline chain. The method takes
    into account whether the movement should be finalized with or without a final
    position update and whether it should trigger any post-movement callbacks.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement is being finalized. This
      represents the entity that was following the spline chain path.
  - name: param1
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether a final position update should be
      performed. If true, the unit's position will be updated to reflect the end of
      the spline chain.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether post-movement callbacks or events
      should be triggered. If true, any registered callbacks for movement completion
      will be invoked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Finalization of Spline Chain Movement
    code: 'Unit* target = ...; // Get the unit

      bool updatePosition = true;

      bool triggerCallbacks = false;

      splineChainGenerator->Finalize(target, updatePosition, triggerCallbacks);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete Finalization with Position Update and Callbacks
    code: 'Unit* unit = ...; // Get the unit

      splineChainGenerator->Finalize(unit, true, true); // Finalize with position
      update and callback trigger'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after all spline chain operations have
    been completed or interrupted. It is important to ensure that the Unit pointer
    passed in is valid and not null to avoid undefined behavior. The method internally
    manages memory cleanup for the movement chain, so developers should not manually
    free resources related to this movement generator.
  warnings: Calling Finalize with an invalid Unit pointer may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the unit is still valid and has not been destroyed before
    calling this method. Also, be cautious about calling this method multiple times
    on the same movement chain as it may cause resource leaks or inconsistent state.
