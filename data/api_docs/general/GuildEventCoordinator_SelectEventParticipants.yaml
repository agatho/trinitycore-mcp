  brief: Selects and returns the number of participants for a specified guild event.
  description: The SelectEventParticipants method retrieves the list of players who
    are registered or eligible to participate in a specific guild event identified
    by its unique event ID. This method is typically used during event management
    operations within the TrinityCore framework, such as preparing for event start
    times or determining participation eligibility. It may involve checking player
    guild membership, event registration status, and other game-specific conditions
    to compile a list of valid participants. The returned integer represents the count
    of selected participants, which can be zero if no eligible players are found or
    if the event does not exist.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of participants successfully selected
    for the guild event. Returns 0 if no participants are found or if an error occurs
    during participant selection.
  examples:

  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures such as player
    registries and event tracking systems. It may perform database queries or cache
    lookups to determine eligible participants based on guild membership and event
    rules.
