  brief: Returns the portrait display ID associated with the quest's turn-in requirements
  description: This method retrieves the unique portrait display ID that represents
    the visual appearance of the NPC or object associated with a quest's turn-in requirements.
    The returned value typically corresponds to the model or sprite displayed when
    players interact with quest givers, particularly in relation to quest completion.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other quest-related methods to determine
    how quests should be presented visually to players. This method does not require
    any parameters and returns a uint32 value representing the display ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents a unique display ID that corresponds to the
    portrait or model associated with the quest's turn-in requirements. This value
    is typically used in UI display logic and may be related to the quest giver's
    visual representation, such as NPC models or quest-related sprites.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 portraitId = quest->GetQuestTurnInPortrait();

      // Use portraitId in UI logic to display appropriate quest turn-in portrait'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Quest class and is typically used during quest
    completion or interaction processing. It may be affected by game mechanics such
    as quest givers' visual representation, and should be used in conjunction with
    other quest-related methods for full functionality.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no valid portrait display ID is associated
    with the quest turn-in requirements. Care should be taken when using this value
    in UI logic to ensure proper handling of invalid or null values.
