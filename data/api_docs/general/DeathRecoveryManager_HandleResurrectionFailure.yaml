  signature: void DeathRecoveryManager::HandleResurrectionFailure(const std::string
    & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the failure of a resurrection attempt by processing the provided
    reason and triggering appropriate game events.
  description: The HandleResurrectionFailure method is responsible for managing cases
    where a player's resurrection attempt fails. It takes a reason string that describes
    why the resurrection failed, and processes this information to notify the player,
    update relevant game states, and potentially trigger additional mechanics such
    as penalty systems or cooldowns. This method is typically invoked during death
    recovery scenarios when a resurrection cannot be completed due to various conditions
    like invalid target, insufficient resources, or server-side restrictions. The
    method does not return any value but performs internal state updates and communication
    with the client.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: A string describing the reason for the resurrection failure. This
      may include messages such as 'invalid target', 'insufficient resources', or
      'cooldown active'. The string is used to communicate the specific cause of failure
      to the player and may influence subsequent game behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when resurrection fails due to invalid target
    code: 'DeathRecoveryManager drMgr;

      drMgr.HandleResurrectionFailure("invalid target");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in a custom death handler with dynamic reason
    code: "void CustomDeathHandler(Player* player) {\n    // Simulate some condition\
      \ that prevents resurrection\n    if (!CanResurrect(player)) {\n        DeathRecoveryManager\
      \ drMgr;\n        drMgr.HandleResurrectionFailure(\"resurrection denied by server\
      \ rules\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the death recovery system and should only be called
    when a resurrection attempt has definitively failed. It assumes that appropriate
    checks have already been performed to determine failure conditions. The reason
    string should be localized for client display if needed.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the resurrection actually
    failed, as it may trigger unintended game state changes or player notifications.
    Ensure that the reason parameter is sanitized to prevent potential client-side
    issues or exploits.
