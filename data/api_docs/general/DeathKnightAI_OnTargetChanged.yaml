  signature: void DeathKnightAI::OnTargetChanged(Unit * newTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Death Knight's AI behavior when its target changes.
  description: The OnTargetChanged method is a callback function invoked by the TrinityCore
    AI system whenever a Death Knight's current target is updated. This method allows
    the AI to react to target transitions, such as switching from one enemy to another,
    and can be used to reset or adjust the AI's state, abilities, or strategy based
    on the new target. It plays a crucial role in maintaining proper combat behavior
    for Death Knights, especially when handling multiple targets or complex encounter
    mechanics. The method is typically called internally by the core AI framework
    and should not be invoked directly unless implementing custom AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: newTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the new target. Can be nullptr
      if no target is set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom Death Knight AI
    code: "class MyDeathKnightAI : public DeathKnightAI {\npublic:\n    void OnTargetChanged(Unit*\
      \ newTarget) override {\n        // Reset cooldowns or re-evaluate abilities\n\
      \        if (newTarget)\n            DoCast(newTarget, SPELL_DEATH_GRIP);\n\
      \        else\n            // Handle case when target is lost\n            DoCastSelf(SPELL_RAISE_DEAD);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI callback interface in TrinityCore.
    It's expected to be overridden by custom AI implementations to provide specific
    behavior for Death Knights. The method may be called multiple times during a single
    combat encounter, especially when targets are switched rapidly.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you're implementing a custom AI
    system. Overriding this method without proper handling of the new target can lead
    to unexpected behavior or crashes if the target is null or invalid.
