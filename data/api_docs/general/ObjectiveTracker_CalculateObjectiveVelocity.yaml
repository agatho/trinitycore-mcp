  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: CalculateObjectiveVelocity
  signature: float ObjectiveTracker::CalculateObjectiveVelocity(Player * bot, uint32
    questId, uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the velocity of a quest objective for a player bot.
  description: The CalculateObjectiveVelocity method computes the rate at which a
    specific quest objective is progressing for a given player bot. This calculation
    typically considers factors such as time elapsed, objective completion status,
    and player activity to determine how quickly the objective is being fulfilled.
    The method is used primarily in AI-driven quest management systems where bots
    need to evaluate progress and adjust their behavior accordingly. It returns a
    float value representing the velocity of progress toward completing the specified
    quest objective.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the objective
      velocity is calculated. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective. Must correspond
      to a valid active quest for the player.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Zero-based index of the specific objective within the quest. Must
      be a valid index for the given quest's objectives.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated velocity of the specified quest
    objective. Higher values indicate faster progress, while lower or negative values
    may indicate slow progress or no progress at all.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: float velocity = objectiveTracker->CalculateObjectiveVelocity(bot, 12345,
      0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (objectiveTracker->CalculateObjectiveVelocity(bot, questId, objIndex)\
      \ > 0.5f)\n{\n    // Objective is progressing quickly\n    bot->GetAI()->SetNextAction(AIAction::EXPLORE);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Objective is progressing slowly or stalled\n    bot->GetAI()->SetNextAction(AIAction::WAIT);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves time-based calculations and may cache results
    for performance reasons. It's important to ensure that the quest and objective
    indices are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid quest IDs or objective indices can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate inputs before calling this method. The returned velocity
    value is a relative measure and may not directly correspond to real-world time
    units.
