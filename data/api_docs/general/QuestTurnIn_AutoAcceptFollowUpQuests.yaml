  signature: void QuestTurnIn::AutoAcceptFollowUpQuests(Player * bot, uint32 completedQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Automatically accepts follow-up quests for a player after completing a specified
    quest.
  description: The AutoAcceptFollowUpQuests method is responsible for automatically
    accepting any available follow-up quests that are eligible for acceptance by the
    specified player character. This typically occurs after a player completes a quest
    which has subsequent quests in its chain. The method checks for eligible quests
    based on the completed quest ID and the player's current quest log status. It
    ensures that the player receives immediate notification and acceptance of these
    follow-up quests without requiring manual interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who will
      accept the follow-up quests.
  - name: completedQuestId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest that was just completed by
      the player. This ID is used to determine which follow-up quests should be accepted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Accepting Follow-Up Quests After Completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Automatically\
      \ accept any follow-up quests after completing a quest\n    QuestTurnIn::AutoAcceptFollowUpQuests(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in automated questing systems or AI scripts
    where quest progression needs to be handled without manual player intervention.
    The implementation relies on the internal quest system of TrinityCore and may
    depend on quest dependencies being properly defined in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the completedQuestId passed to this function corresponds to
    a valid quest that actually has follow-up quests available. Passing an invalid
    or non-existent quest ID might result in no action being taken, or could potentially
    cause unexpected behavior if the system attempts to process non-existent quest
    data.
