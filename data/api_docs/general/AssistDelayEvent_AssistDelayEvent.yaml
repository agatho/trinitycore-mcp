  method: AssistDelayEvent
  signature: void AssistDelayEvent::AssistDelayEvent(int victim, int & owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an assist delay event for a victim and owner.
  description: The AssistDelayEvent method is responsible for setting up a delayed
    assist mechanism within the TrinityCore AI system. It takes a victim identifier
    and a reference to an owner identifier, likely used to track which creature or
    player should receive assistance after a specified delay. This functionality is
    commonly used in AI behavior trees where creatures need to wait before assisting
    allies or targets. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    state related to the assist timing and ownership tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: An integer identifier representing the target or creature that requires
      assistance. This could be a GUID or index value used internally by the AI system.
  - name: owner
    description: A reference to an integer identifier representing the entity that
      owns or is responsible for triggering the assist delay event. This may be modified
      during execution to reflect updated ownership or tracking state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assist Delay Initialization
    code: 'int victimId = 12345;

      int ownerId = 67890;

      AssistDelayEvent assistEvent;

      assistEvent.AssistDelayEvent(victimId, ownerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Assist Delay with AI Behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ target) override {\n        int victim = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \        int& owner = m_owner;\n        assistDelayEvent.AssistDelayEvent(victim,\
      \ owner);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked within AI update loops or event handlers
    to schedule delayed actions. It may interact with internal timers or queues that
    manage when the actual assist action occurs. The 'owner' parameter might be updated
    during execution to maintain proper tracking of who initiated the assist behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both victim and owner identifiers are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid values could lead to undefined behavior or crashes in
    the AI system. Be cautious about modifying the owner reference outside of this
    context, as it may affect the intended assist delay logic.
