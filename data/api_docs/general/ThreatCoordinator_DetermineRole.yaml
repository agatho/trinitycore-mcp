  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: DetermineRole
  signature: ThreatRole ThreatCoordinator::DetermineRole(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines the threat role of a player bot within the threat coordination
    system.
  description: The DetermineRole method evaluates a Player bot's current combat state,
    class, and role-specific attributes to assign it a ThreatRole enum value. This
    role dictates how the bot should behave in threat management scenarios, such as
    whether it should focus on tanking, DPS, or support duties. The method considers
    factors like the bot's equipped gear, current target, and group composition to
    make this determination. It is typically used by AI systems to dynamically adjust
    bot behavior based on evolving combat conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ThreatRole enum value indicating the determined role of the player bot.
    Possible values may include TANK, DAMAGE, HEALING, or SUPPORT depending on the
    implementation and current context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ThreatRole role = threatCoordinator.DetermineRole(botPlayer);\nswitch (role)\n\
      {\n    case TANK:\n        // Handle tanking logic\n        break;\n    case\
      \ DAMAGE:\n        // Handle DPS logic\n        break;\n    default:\n     \
      \   // Handle other roles\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during combat to dynamically adjust
    bot behavior. It may cache results for performance reasons, but should be re-evaluated
    when significant changes occur in the bot's state or environment.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null.
    Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized player object may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes.
