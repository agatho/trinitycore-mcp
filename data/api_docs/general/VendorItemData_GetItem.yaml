documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a vendor item from the vendor's inventory at the specified slot
    index.
  description: The GetItem method retrieves a const pointer to a VendorItem object
    located at the specified slot index within the vendor's item list. This method
    is typically used when iterating through or accessing specific items offered by
    a vendor in the World of Warcraft game world. The slot parameter represents the
    zero-based index of the item in the vendor's inventory, and the method returns
    a null pointer if the slot is out of bounds or if no item exists at that position.
    It is important to note that the returned pointer is const, meaning the item data
    should not be modified through this interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the VendorItem object at the specified slot index, or
    nullptr if the slot is invalid or no item exists at that location.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing a specific vendor item
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorData = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nconst\
      \ VendorItem* item = vendorData->GetItem(0);\nif (item != nullptr)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the item\n    uint32 itemId = item->item;\n    float price = item->price;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all vendor items
    code: "VendorItemData* vendorData = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nfor (uint32\
      \ i = 0; i < vendorData->GetItemCount(); ++i)\n{\n    const VendorItem* item\
      \ = vendorData->GetItem(i);\n    if (item != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Process\
      \ each valid item\n        printf(\"Item ID: %u, Price: %.2f\\n\", item->item,\
      \ item->price);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct index-based lookup and is generally efficient.
    However, it does not perform bounds checking internally beyond returning nullptr
    for invalid indices. Developers should ensure that the slot index passed to this
    method is within valid range (0 to GetItemCount() - 1) to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned VendorItem object through the const pointer.
    If modifications are required, use appropriate setter methods or create a copy
    of the item data. Also, be cautious when using this method in multithreaded environments
    where the vendor's inventory might change concurrently.
