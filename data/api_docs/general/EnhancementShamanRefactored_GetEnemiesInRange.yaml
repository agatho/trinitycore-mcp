  class: EnhancementShamanRefactored
  method: GetEnemiesInRange
  signature: uint32 EnhancementShamanRefactored::GetEnemiesInRange(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of enemy units within a specified range of the EnhancementShamanRefactored
    unit.
  description: The GetEnemiesInRange method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the defined range of the
    EnhancementShamanRefactored instance. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes to determine optimal spell or ability usage based on enemy proximity.
    The range parameter defines the maximum distance from the shaman's position at
    which enemies are considered to be in range. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is safe for use in conditional logic or loop constructs. It relies on
    the underlying game engine's collision detection system to accurately identify
    nearby units.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the count of enemy units found within
    the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no enemies are present within
    range, while any positive integer represents the actual number of enemies detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Enemy Count
    code: "uint32 enemiesInRange = shaman.GetEnemiesInRange(10.0f);\nif (enemiesInRange\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Perform action when enemies are nearby\n    shaman.CastLightningBolt();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Enemy Count for Spell Selection Logic
    code: "uint32 enemies = shaman.GetEnemiesInRange(25.0f);\nif (enemies >= 3)\n\
      {\n    shaman.CastChainLightning();\n}\nelse if (enemies == 1)\n{\n    shaman.CastLightningBolt();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query using the game's internal unit positioning
    system. It may have performance implications when called frequently in tight loops
    or on units with many nearby enemies. The range value is typically measured in
    yards in World of Warcraft's coordinate system.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is positive and reasonable for gameplay
    balance. Using extremely large ranges might cause performance degradation or unexpected
    behavior in crowded areas. This method should not be used to directly manipulate
    unit positions or states.
