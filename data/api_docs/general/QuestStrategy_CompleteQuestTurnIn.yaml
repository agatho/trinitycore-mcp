  class: QuestStrategy
  method: CompleteQuestTurnIn
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::CompleteQuestTurnIn(BotAI * ai, uint32 questId, ::Unit
    * questEnder)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a quest turn-in process for a bot AI character.
  description: The CompleteQuestTurnIn method handles the finalization of a quest
    completion by a bot AI character. It processes the necessary actions to turn in
    the quest to the specified quest ender NPC, updates the quest status in the bot's
    quest log, and manages any associated rewards or follow-up quest triggers. This
    method ensures proper quest progression within the TrinityCore framework for AI-controlled
    characters.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot character performing
      the quest turn-in.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest being turned in, used to locate and
      validate the quest in the game database.
  - name: questEnder
    description: Pointer to the Unit instance representing the NPC that accepts the
      quest turn-in (e.g., quest giver).
  returns: Returns true if the quest turn-in was successfully processed and completed,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate invalid parameters, quest
    not found, or failure in the turn-in process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Turn-In
    code: "if (strategy->CompleteQuestTurnIn(ai, 12345, questGiver)) {\n    ai->GetBot()->GetSession()->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Quest completed!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Quest Turn-In
    code: "uint32 questId = 67890;\nUnit* questGiver = ai->GetBot()->GetNPCIfCanInteractWith(questId);\n\
      if (questGiver && strategy->CompleteQuestTurnIn(ai, questId, questGiver)) {\n\
      \    // Handle successful turn-in\n    ai->GetBot()->SetQuestStatus(questId,\
      \ QUEST_STATUS_COMPLETE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has already completed all quest requirements
    and that the quest giver is within interaction range. The method internally handles
    communication with the TrinityCore quest system and may trigger additional AI
    behaviors based on quest completion.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId corresponds to a valid quest in the database,
    and that the questEnder parameter points to a legitimate NPC capable of accepting
    quest turn-ins. Failure to validate these conditions may result in undefined behavior
    or failed quest completion.
