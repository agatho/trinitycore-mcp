  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleElementalBlast(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to cast Elemental Blast spell on a target unit.
  description: The HandleElementalBlast method is responsible for executing the Elemental
    Blast ability within the ShamanAI class. This method determines whether the shaman
    can cast the spell, selects an appropriate target, and initiates the casting process.
    It typically operates as part of the AI's combat decision-making loop, evaluating
    conditions such as mana availability, target validity, and spell cooldowns before
    proceeding with the cast. The method returns true if the spell was successfully
    initiated or is already in progress, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's ID. If null
      or invalid, the AI will attempt to select a suitable target from the current
      threat list.
  returns: Returns true if the Elemental Blast spell was successfully initiated or
    is already in progress; returns false if conditions prevent casting such as insufficient
    mana, invalid target, or cooldown.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with target selection
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleElementalBlast(nullptr)) {\n    // Spell cast started\
      \ successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with specific target ID
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Get target unit\nint targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      if (shamanAI->HandleElementalBlast(&targetId)) {\n    // Elemental Blast cast\
      \ on specified target\n} else {\n    // Could not cast Elemental Blast\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI behavior system and integrates with
    TrinityCore's spell casting framework. It assumes that the shaman unit has the
    necessary spell learned and that the target is within range and valid for casting.
    The method may perform internal checks like mana consumption, cooldowns, and line-of-sight
    validation.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid unit ID or is null;
    passing an invalid pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Also, calling this
    method without checking spell availability or resource constraints might result
    in failed casts or performance issues.
