  method: SpellAction
  signature: void SpellAction::SpellAction(const std::string & name, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SpellAction object with a spell name and ID for use in game
    mechanics.
  description: The SpellAction constructor initializes a new SpellAction instance
    by associating a human-readable spell name with its corresponding internal spell
    identifier. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to
    manage spell-related actions, particularly in AI scripts or custom spell handlers.
    The spell ID parameter corresponds to the unique identifier used internally by
    the game engine for spell lookup and execution. The name parameter allows for
    easier debugging and identification of spells during runtime. This constructor
    does not perform any validation on the provided spell ID, so it's expected that
    valid spell IDs are passed in order to ensure proper functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A string representing the human-readable name of the spell. This
      is used for identification and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore system.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique internal identifier for the spell in the TrinityCore database.
      This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the spell.dbc or related
      spell tables.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SpellAction Initialization
    code: 'SpellAction fireballAction("Fireball", 133);

      // Initializes a SpellAction object for the Fireball spell with ID 133'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SpellAction in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeSpellActions()\n\
      \    {\n        spellActions.push_back(SpellAction(\"Heal\", 12345));\n    \
      \    spellActions.push_back(SpellAction(\"Frostbolt\", 118));\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of a larger SpellAction class that likely manages
    spell execution logic. The spell ID should be validated against the game's spell
    database to ensure it exists and functions correctly. In TrinityCore, spell IDs
    are typically defined in the spell.dbc file or through the database schema.
  warnings: Passing an invalid spell ID may result in undefined behavior or failed
    spell execution. Always validate spell IDs before initialization if working with
    dynamic spell assignments.
