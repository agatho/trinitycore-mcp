documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the energy combo resource has reached its maximum combo points.
  description: The IsMaxComboPoints method determines if the current energy combo
    resource for a player or unit has reached the maximum number of combo points allowed.
    This is commonly used in game mechanics related to energy-based combo systems
    such as those found in Rogue class abilities or other energy-based gameplay elements
    within TrinityCore. The method performs a simple comparison against the maximum
    combo point threshold and returns true if the current resource level equals or
    exceeds this limit.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the energy combo resource has reached its maximum combo
    points, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check combo points
    code: "if (player->GetEnergyComboResource()->IsMaxComboPoints()) {\n    // Player\
      \ has maximum combo points\n    // Execute combo point based action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other energy combo resource
    management functions. It's important to note that the actual maximum value may
    vary depending on the specific class or game mechanics being implemented, as different
    classes might have different maximum combo point limits.
