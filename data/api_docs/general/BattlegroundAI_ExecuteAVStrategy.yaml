  method: ExecuteAVStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::ExecuteAVStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Alterac Valley AI strategy for a given player.
  description: The ExecuteAVStrategy method is responsible for implementing the artificial
    intelligence behavior specific to the Alterac Valley battleground. This method
    determines how NPCs and players should act during the battle, including objectives,
    movement patterns, and strategic decisions. It typically handles the logic for
    capturing objectives, defending key positions, and coordinating group actions
    within the context of the Alterac Valley game mode. The method operates on a provided
    player reference to apply appropriate AI behaviors based on the current battleground
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the battleground. This parameter is used to determine which player's
      AI strategy should be executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteAVStrategy
    code: 'BattlegroundAI* bgAI = new BattlegroundAI();

      int playerId = 12345;

      bgAI->ExecuteAVStrategy(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground updates or when specific
    events occur in Alterac Valley. It's important to ensure that the player reference
    passed is valid and corresponds to an active participant in the battleground.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player parameter may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect AI execution. Ensure that the player identifier is valid before calling
    this method.
