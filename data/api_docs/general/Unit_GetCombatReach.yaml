  class: Unit
  method: GetCombatReach
  signature: float Unit::GetCombatReach() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the combat reach distance of the unit, which determines how far the
    unit can attack from.
  description: The GetCombatReach method returns the combat reach distance of a Unit
    object, which represents the maximum distance at which the unit can perform melee
    attacks. This value is crucial for determining whether a unit is within range
    of its target for combat purposes. The combat reach is typically influenced by
    the unit's size and model, with larger units generally having greater reach distances.
    For player characters, this value may be affected by buffs, debuffs, or equipment
    modifications. The method is commonly used in combat calculations and AI logic
    to determine if a unit is within attack range of its target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the combat reach distance in yards.
    This value typically ranges from 0.5 to 10.0 yards depending on the unit's size
    and type, with default values around 1.5-2.0 yards for most humanoid units.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float reach = unit->GetCombatReach();\nif (reach > 0) {\n    // Use reach\
      \ to determine if target is within attack range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in combat calculations and AI logic. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply returns a stored value. Thread safety
    is assured as the method is const and does not modify any internal state.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with GetDistance(), which measures
    actual distance between units. The combat reach value may vary based on unit's
    size and model, and can be affected by buffs or debuffs in some cases.
