documentation:
  brief: Handles the application and management of defensive cooldowns for the Affliction
    Warlock class.
  description: The HandleDefensiveCooldowns method is responsible for managing all
    defensive abilities and cooldowns specific to the Affliction Warlock specialization.
    This includes checking if defensive spells such as Dark Regeneration, Soulstone,
    or other protective measures are available for use, evaluating their current cooldown
    status, and applying them when appropriate based on the warlock's current health
    state, threat level, and combat situation. The method ensures that defensive cooldowns
    are used efficiently to maximize survivability during intense encounters while
    respecting game balance and cooldown mechanics. It typically integrates with the
    AI decision-making process to determine optimal timing for defensive actions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Loop
    code: "void AfflictionWarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic\
      \ ...\n    if (m_isDefensiveCooldownsReady)\n        m_warlock->HandleDefensiveCooldowns();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to ensure
    timely application of defensive cooldowns. It is recommended that this method
    only be invoked when the warlock is in combat or under threat, as defensive cooldowns
    are typically not useful outside of active encounters.
  warnings: Improper use of defensive cooldowns can lead to unnecessary resource waste
    or missed opportunities for survival. Ensure that cooldowns are properly tracked
    and not used prematurely or too frequently to avoid violating game balance.
