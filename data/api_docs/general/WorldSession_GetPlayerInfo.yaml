documentation:
  brief: Returns a formatted string containing detailed information about the player
    associated with this session
  description: The GetPlayerInfo method retrieves comprehensive player identification
    and status information from the WorldSession object. This method typically constructs
    a string that includes the player's GUID, name, level, faction, and other relevant
    session data. The returned string is formatted for logging, debugging, or display
    purposes within the TrinityCore server environment. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is safe to call during active gameplay or session handling
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted player information including GUID, name,
    level, faction, and session status details. Returns an empty string if no player
    is associated with the session.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Logging
    code: "void HandlePlayerInfoCommand(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ playerInfo = session->GetPlayerInfo();\n    sLog->outString(\"Player Info:\
      \ %s\", playerInfo.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging Session Information
    code: "void DebugSession(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    if (session)\n    {\n\
      \        std::string info = session->GetPlayerInfo();\n        if (!info.empty())\n\
      \        {\n            sLog->outString(\"Active session player data: %s\",\
      \ info.c_str());\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      No player associated with session\");\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for debugging and logging purposes. The exact
    format of the returned string may vary based on TrinityCore version and configuration
    settings. It's recommended to check if the returned string is empty before processing,
    as sessions without active players will return an empty result.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid player object exists in the session. Calling
    this method on a session with no associated player will return an empty string,
    which may cause issues if not properly checked. This method should not be used
    for performance-critical operations due to string construction overhead.
