  class: Battlefield
  method: GetData
  signature: int Battlefield::GetData(int dataId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves specific data value associated with a Battlefield instance using
    an identifier.
  description: The GetData method is used to fetch a particular data value from a
    Battlefield object, identified by a numeric ID. This method allows access to various
    battlefield-related configuration or state information, such as objectives, rewards,
    or status flags. The data returned depends on the specific dataId provided and
    is typically used for synchronization, UI updates, or game logic decisions within
    the battlefield system. It is a read-only accessor that does not modify any internal
    state of the Battlefield object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the requested data value associated with
    the given dataId. The meaning of this value depends on the specific dataId passed
    to the method, and may represent counts, flags, identifiers, or other numeric
    battlefield properties.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Objective Count
    code: int objectiveCount = battlefield->GetData(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_OBJECTIVE_COUNT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Battlefield Status Flag
    code: "int status = battlefield->GetData(BATTLEFIELD_DATA_STATUS_FLAG);\nif (status\
      \ == BATTLEFIELD_STATUS_ACTIVE)\n{\n    // Handle active battlefield logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with predefined data ID constants
    defined within the Battlefield class or related enums. The implementation likely
    uses an internal lookup table or map to associate data IDs with their respective
    values, making it efficient for frequent access during gameplay loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the dataId parameter corresponds to a valid and supported
    identifier within the current Battlefield implementation, as invalid IDs may return
    unexpected or default values. Accessing data from a destroyed or uninitialized
    battlefield instance may lead to undefined behavior.
