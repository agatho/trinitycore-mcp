  signature: const DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GameObjectSnapshot * SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindGameObjectByGuid(Player
    * bot, int guid, float searchRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Finds a game object by its unique identifier within a specified search radius
    for the given player.
  description: The FindGameObjectByGuid method searches through the spatial grid system
    to locate a specific game object based on its GUID. It operates within the context
    of a player's current zone and uses a double-buffered spatial grid structure for
    efficient querying. The method takes into account the player's location and a
    defined search radius to limit the scope of the search, improving performance
    by avoiding unnecessary traversal of distant objects. This function is typically
    used in AI logic or quest scripts where specific game objects need to be located
    dynamically during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the game object search is being
      performed. The method uses this player's position and zone context to determine
      which spatial grid cells to query.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the target game
      object. This GUID must correspond to an existing GameObject in the world.
  - name: searchRadius
    description: Float value defining the maximum distance from the player's position
      within which to search for the game object. Objects beyond this radius will
      be ignored.
  returns: Returns a pointer to a DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GameObjectSnapshot structure
    if the specified game object is found within the search radius and zone. Returns
    nullptr if no matching game object is located or if the input parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find a specific GameObject by GUID
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nint targetGuid =\
      \ 12345;\nfloat radius = 50.0f;\nconst DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GameObjectSnapshot*\
      \ foundObject = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindGameObjectByGuid(player, targetGuid,\
      \ radius);\nif (foundObject != nullptr) {\n    // Process the found game object\n\
      \    printf(\"Found GameObject with GUID %d at position (%f, %f, %f)\\n\", \n\
      \           targetGuid, foundObject->GetPositionX(), foundObject->GetPositionY(),\
      \ foundObject->GetPositionZ());\n} else {\n    printf(\"GameObject with GUID\
      \ %d not found within radius %f\\n\", targetGuid, radius);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using FindGameObjectByGuid in AI decision making
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player pointer\nint chestGuid = 98765;\n\
      const DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GameObjectSnapshot* chest = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindGameObjectByGuid(bot,\
      \ chestGuid, 30.0f);\nif (chest != nullptr && chest->GetGoState() == GO_STATE_READY)\
      \ {\n    // AI can now interact with the chest\n    bot->GetMotionMaster()->MovePoint(0,\
      \ chest->GetPositionX(), chest->GetPositionY(), chest->GetPositionZ());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a double-buffered spatial grid system which may have
    slight delays in reflecting real-time changes to game object positions. The search
    is optimized by using the player's current zone and radius constraints, but performance
    can degrade if the search radius is too large or if many objects are present in
    the area. The returned GameObjectSnapshot should not be modified directly as it
    might cause inconsistencies in the spatial grid data structures.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-null return value guarantees the object is currently
    active or interactable; additional checks like GO_STATE_READY may be required.
    Be cautious when using large search radii as this can impact performance significantly.
    The method does not perform any locking internally, so concurrent access to the
    spatial grid during query execution should be managed by the caller.
