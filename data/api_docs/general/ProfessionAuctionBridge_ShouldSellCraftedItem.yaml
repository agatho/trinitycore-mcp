  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: ShouldSellCraftedItem
  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::ShouldSellCraftedItem(int * player, uint32
    itemId, uint32 materialCost) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a crafted item should be sold on the auction house based
    on player and item criteria.
  description: The ShouldSellCraftedItem method evaluates if a crafted item meets
    specific conditions for being listed on the auction house. It takes into account
    the player's status, the item ID, and the material cost to decide whether the
    item is worth selling. This method is typically used in conjunction with crafting
    professions to automate auction house listings. The decision-making process may
    consider factors such as item value, market demand, and player inventory capacity.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that crafted the item. Used to access
      player-specific data such as inventory and auction settings.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the crafted item. This is used to look up
      item properties and determine its market value.
  - name: materialCost
    description: The total cost of materials used to craft the item. This value helps
      determine if the item's potential profit justifies listing it on the auction
      house.
  returns: Returns true if the crafted item should be sold on the auction house, false
    otherwise. The decision is based on a combination of item value, material cost,
    and player-specific settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in crafting logic
    code: "if (ProfessionAuctionBridge::ShouldSellCraftedItem(&player, 12345, 500))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with auction listing\n    AuctionHouseMgr::AddAuctionItem(&player,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with crafting event handling
    code: "void OnCraftedItem(Player* player, uint32 itemId, uint32 materialCost)\
      \ {\n    if (ProfessionAuctionBridge::ShouldSellCraftedItem(player, itemId,\
      \ materialCost)) {\n        // Automatically list item on AH\n        AuctionHouseMgr::ListCraftedItem(player,\
      \ itemId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with auction house pricing algorithms and may
    be influenced by player reputation or auction house settings. Developers should
    ensure that the player object passed is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure all parameters are validated before use, especially
    when dealing with item IDs that may not exist in the database.
