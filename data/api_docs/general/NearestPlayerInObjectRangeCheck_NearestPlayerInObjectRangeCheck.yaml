documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of NearestPlayerInObjectRangeCheck by copying
    an existing instance.
  description: The NearestPlayerInObjectRangeCheck constructor is used to create a
    new instance of the class by copying the state from another existing instance.
    This is a copy constructor that ensures proper initialization of the object's
    internal data members and maintains consistency with the source object's configuration.
    The class is typically used in TrinityCore's AI and targeting systems to find
    the nearest player within a specified range of an object, such as a creature or
    game object. It is commonly employed in AI decision-making processes where proximity-based
    targeting is required.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing NearestPlayerInObjectRangeCheck instance to be copied
      from. This parameter must be a valid, initialized instance of the class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an Existing Instance
    code: 'NearestPlayerInObjectRangeCheck originalCheck(targetObject);

      NearestPlayerInObjectRangeCheck newCheck(originalCheck); // Copy constructor
      usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This copy constructor is essential for maintaining object state consistency
    when creating new instances of NearestPlayerInObjectRangeCheck. The implementation
    likely copies internal targeting parameters, range values, and other configuration
    settings from the source object to ensure identical behavior.
