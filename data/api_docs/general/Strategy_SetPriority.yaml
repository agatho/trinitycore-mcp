  method: SetPriority
  signature: void Strategy::SetPriority(uint32 priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the priority level for the AI strategy.
  description: The SetPriority method assigns a numerical priority value to an AI
    strategy, determining its execution order within the game's decision-making system.
    This priority influences how often and when the strategy is evaluated during AI
    processing cycles. Higher priority strategies are typically executed before lower
    priority ones, though the exact behavior may depend on the specific implementation
    of the AI framework. The method does not validate the input value, so developers
    should ensure that priority values are within expected ranges for optimal performance.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: A uint32 value representing the strategy's priority level. Lower
      numerical values typically indicate higher priority, though this can vary based
      on implementation details. Valid range is generally 0 to UINT32_MAX, with common
      usage between 0 and 1000.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Strategy Priority
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = new Strategy();

      myStrategy->SetPriority(50);

      // The strategy will now have a medium priority level'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Priority for Combat Strategy
    code: 'Strategy* combatStrategy = sAIConfig->GetStrategy("combat");

      combatStrategy->SetPriority(10);

      // Ensures combat strategy is prioritized over other strategies

      // This is useful when customizing AI behavior in battlegrounds or raids'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal priority member of the Strategy
    object. It should be called before the strategy is registered with the AI manager
    to ensure proper initialization. The priority value affects performance indirectly
    by influencing how frequently a strategy is considered during AI decision-making,
    so it's recommended to use sensible values (typically 0-1000) for better maintainability.
  warnings: Setting extremely high priority values may cause unintended behavior if
    the system expects specific ranges. Avoid setting negative values or very large
    numbers that could overflow or cause unexpected results in comparison operations.
    This method does not perform any validation on the input value, so developers
    must ensure proper bounds checking externally.
