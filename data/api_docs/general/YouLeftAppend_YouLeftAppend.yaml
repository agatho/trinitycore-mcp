documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from a channel when they leave it.
  description: The YouLeftAppend method is responsible for handling the removal of
    a player from a specific chat channel when they disconnect or explicitly leave
    the channel. This method ensures proper cleanup of channel membership data and
    may trigger notifications to other channel members about the player's departure.
    It typically operates within the context of TrinityCore's chat system, managing
    channel state and player associations.
  parameters:
  - name: channel
    description: Pointer to the Channel object from which the player is being removed.
      Must be a valid channel instance; null pointer results in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when player leaves a channel
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeaveChannel(Player* player, Channel* channel)\n{\n  \
      \  if (channel && player)\n    {\n        YouLeftAppend::YouLeftAppend(channel);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal channel membership lists and may broadcast
    a leave message to remaining channel members. It should only be called when a
    player is confirmed to be leaving the channel.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null channel pointer can lead to crashes or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the channel exists and is valid before invoking
    this method.
