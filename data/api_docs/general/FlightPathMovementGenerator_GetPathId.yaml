  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: GetPathId
  signature: uint32 FlightPathMovementGenerator::GetPathId(size_t index) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flight path ID at the specified index from the movement generator's
    internal path list.
  description: The GetPathId method retrieves a unique identifier for a specific flight
    path segment within the FlightPathMovementGenerator. This identifier corresponds
    to the path data used by the client to determine how a creature or player should
    move along a predefined flight route. The method accepts an index parameter that
    specifies which path segment's ID to retrieve from an internal collection of flight
    paths. It is commonly used during flight path processing and movement validation
    in World of Warcraft's AI and movement systems. The returned value represents
    the database identifier for the flight path, typically referencing entries in
    the `flightpath` or related tables within the TrinityCore database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier (ID) of the flight
    path at the specified index. This ID corresponds to an entry in the game's flight
    path database table and is used by the client to load and render the appropriate
    flight route.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving a Flight Path ID
    code: "uint32 pathId = movementGenerator.GetPathId(0);\nif (pathId != 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Use pathId to query flight path data\n    sLog->outString(\"Retrieved\
      \ flight path ID: %u\", pathId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the index parameter is within valid bounds of the
    internal path list. Accessing an invalid index may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect data retrieval. This method is typically used internally by movement
    generators and should not be called directly unless you are implementing custom
    flight path logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the index passed to this method does not exceed the size of
    the internal path collection, as doing so could lead to memory access violations
    or invalid data being returned. Always validate the index before calling this
    method if it comes from external input.
