  brief: Retrieves the expiration time of a player choice dialog in seconds since
    epoch
  description: The GetExpireTime method returns the timestamp at which a player choice
    dialog will expire. This is typically used to determine how much time remains
    before the choice options become unavailable. The returned value represents a
    Unix timestamp (seconds since January 1, 1970) indicating when the choice will
    no longer be accessible to the player. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with player choice systems such as those found in quest rewards or interactive
    NPC dialogues where time-sensitive decisions are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) when the
    player choice will expire. Returns 0 if no expiration time is set or if the choice
    has already expired.
  examples:
  - title: Check remaining time before player choice expires
    code: "PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = player->GetPlayerChoiceData();\nif (choiceData)\n\
      {\n    int expireTime = choiceData->GetExpireTime();\n    if (expireTime > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        time_t currentTime = time(nullptr);\n        int remainingSeconds\
      \ = expireTime - currentTime;\n        if (remainingSeconds > 0)\n        {\n\
      \            // Display remaining time to player\n            ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Choice expires in %d seconds.\", remainingSeconds);\n        }\n        else\n\
      \        {\n            // Choice has expired\n            ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      This choice has expired.\");\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method returns a Unix timestamp which is platform-independent. The expiration
    time may be set by the server when the player choice is initialized, or it might
    be determined dynamically based on game events or quest progress. This value should
    not be modified directly but rather managed through appropriate PlayerChoiceData
    setter methods.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value represents a Unix timestamp and not a
    relative time duration. Always verify that the returned value is greater than
    zero before performing calculations to avoid negative time values. The method
    may return 0 if no expiration was set, so proper null checking should be performed.
