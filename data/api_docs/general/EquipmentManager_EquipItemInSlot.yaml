  class: EquipmentManager
  method: EquipItemInSlot
  signature: void EquipmentManager::EquipItemInSlot(int * player, int * item, uint8
    slot)
documentation:
  brief: Equips an item in a specified slot for a player.
  description: The EquipItemInSlot method is responsible for equipping a given item
    into a specific inventory slot for a player character. This method handles the
    necessary updates to the player's equipment state, including updating the item's
    position in the inventory and triggering any relevant game mechanics such as stat
    modifications or visual changes. It ensures that the item is properly associated
    with the specified slot and that the player's equipment set reflects this change.
    The method does not perform validation on the slot or item parameters, so it's
    expected that callers provide valid inputs to avoid undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for which the item is being equipped.
      Must point to a valid Player instance.
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the item object that will be equipped. Must point to a
      valid Item instance.
  - name: slot
    description: The equipment slot index where the item should be equipped. Valid
      values are typically within the range of available equipment slots (e.g., 0-18
      for standard WoW equipment slots).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Equipment Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Item* item = ...;

      uint8 slot = EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND;

      EquipmentManager::EquipItemInSlot(&player, &item, slot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player and item pointers are valid and that
    the item is already in the player's inventory. It does not perform any checks
    to ensure the item can actually be equipped in the given slot (e.g., weapon type
    compatibility). The actual equipment logic may involve additional internal calls
    to update the player's stats, send packets to clients, or trigger other game systems.
  warnings: Passing invalid pointers for player or item will result in undefined behavior.
    Using an invalid slot index can cause memory corruption or unexpected gameplay
    effects. Always validate inputs before calling this method.
