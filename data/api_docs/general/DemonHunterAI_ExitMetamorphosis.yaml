  method: ExitMetamorphosis
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::ExitMetamorphosis()
documentation:
  brief: Exits the Demon Hunter's Metamorphosis state, reverting to normal form and
    restoring standard abilities.
  description: The ExitMetamorphosis method is responsible for transitioning a Demon
    Hunter character out of their Metamorphosis transformation state. When invoked,
    this method will revert the Demon Hunter back to their regular form, restore their
    normal attack speed and movement capabilities, and re-enable standard abilities
    that are not available while in metamorphosis. This method typically triggers
    when the metamorphosis duration expires or when the player explicitly chooses
    to exit the transformation early. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs no return value operations. It is an integral part of the Demon Hunter's
    class-specific gameplay mechanics, ensuring proper state management during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyDemonHunterAI::OnCombatEnd()\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_METAMORPHOSIS))\n\
      \    {\n        ExitMetamorphosis();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Demon Hunter is in a Metamorphosis
    state. Calling it outside of this context may result in undefined behavior or
    visual glitches. The implementation relies on internal state tracking and should
    not be invoked directly from outside the AI system without proper validation.
  warnings: Do not call ExitMetamorphosis while the Demon Hunter is in the middle
    of casting a spell that requires metamorphosis, as it may interrupt the cast or
    cause animation errors. Always verify the current unit state before invoking this
    method to prevent unexpected behavior.
