  class: SafeCorpseManager
  method: RemoveCorpseReference
  signature: void SafeCorpseManager::RemoveCorpseReference(int corpseGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a corpse reference from the safe corpse manager by its GUID.
  description: The RemoveCorpseReference method removes a specific corpse entry from
    the SafeCorpseManager's internal tracking system using the provided corpse GUID.
    This method is typically invoked when a player's corpse is collected, despawned,
    or otherwise no longer needs to be tracked by the safe corpse manager. The operation
    ensures that the corpse reference is cleared from memory and any associated data
    structures are updated accordingly. It plays a crucial role in maintaining clean
    state management for corpse objects within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: corpseGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the corpse to be removed from tracking.
      This value must correspond to an existing corpse entry managed by the SafeCorpseManager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SafeCorpseManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetCorpseManager();

      manager->RemoveCorpseReference(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided corpseGuid is valid and corresponds
    to an existing corpse in the manager's tracking system. It should be called only
    after verifying that the corpse exists to avoid potential undefined behavior or
    memory issues.
