  class: RollTheBonesTracker
  method: GetLowestBuffDuration
  signature: uint32 RollTheBonesTracker::GetLowestBuffDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the duration in seconds of the buff with the shortest remaining time.
  description: The GetLowestBuffDuration method retrieves the minimum duration value
    among all active buffs tracked by the RollTheBonesTracker instance. This is typically
    used to determine when the next buff will expire, allowing for proper timing of
    new buff applications or UI updates. The method operates on internal tracking
    data that maintains information about active buffs and their expiration times.
    It's commonly invoked during gameplay events where knowing the soonest expiring
    buff is necessary for strategic decisions or visual feedback.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the duration in seconds of the buff with the
    shortest remaining time. Returns 0 if no buffs are currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Next Buff Expiry
    code: "uint32 nextExpiry = tracker->GetLowestBuffDuration();\nif (nextExpiry >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Schedule a reminder or action for when this buff expires\n \
      \   printf(\"Next buff expires in %u seconds\\n\", nextExpiry);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"No active buffs\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the RollTheBonesTracker maintains an internal collection
    of active buffs with valid duration data. The returned value is in seconds and
    represents the absolute time remaining for the buff, not a relative time delta.
