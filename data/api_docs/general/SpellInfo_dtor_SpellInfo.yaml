documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpellInfo object and releases all associated memory resources.
  description: The SpellInfo destructor is responsible for cleaning up all dynamically
    allocated memory and resources that were used to store spell information within
    the TrinityCore framework. This includes releasing memory for spell effects, attributes,
    cooldowns, and any other data structures that are part of the spell definition.
    The destructor ensures proper resource management when a SpellInfo instance is
    no longer needed, preventing memory leaks in the game's spell system. It is automatically
    invoked when a SpellInfo object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = new SpellInfo();

      // ... use spellInfo ...

      delete spellInfo; // Triggers ~SpellInfo() destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Cleanup in Container
    code: 'std::vector<SpellInfo*> spellList;

      spellList.push_back(new SpellInfo());

      // ... populate spellList ...

      spellList.clear(); // Automatically calls ~SpellInfo() for each element'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when objects are
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. SpellInfo objects are typically managed through
    smart pointers or container classes in TrinityCore, so direct manual deletion
    is uncommon.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on a SpellInfo object unless you're
    implementing custom memory management. The destructor assumes all internal resources
    have been properly initialized and may cause undefined behavior if called on an
    uninitialized object.
