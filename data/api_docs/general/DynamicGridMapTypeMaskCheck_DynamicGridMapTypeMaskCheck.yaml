  class: DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck
  method: DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck
  signature: void DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck::DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck(int mask)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a dynamic grid map type mask check with the specified mask value.
  description: The DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck constructor initializes an instance
    of the DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck class with a given integer mask parameter.
    This mask is typically used to define which types of map elements (such as terrain,
    water, or objects) should be considered during grid-based spatial queries or collision
    detection in the game world. The mask value determines the filtering behavior
    for various map types within the dynamic grid system. This initialization is crucial
    for setting up proper map type checking logic that respects the game's spatial
    constraints and object interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: mask
    description: An integer value representing the bitmask configuration for map type
      checking. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a specific map type (e.g., terrain,
      water, objects). Valid values are typically defined by constants or bit flags
      that represent different map element categories.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck maskCheck(0x0001); // Initialize with terrain
      mask
    language: cpp
  - title: Combined Map Types
    code: 'const int TERRAIN_MASK = 0x0001;

      const int WATER_MASK = 0x0002;

      const int OBJECT_MASK = 0x0004;

      DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck maskCheck(TERRAIN_MASK | WATER_MASK); // Check terrain
      and water types'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore map system.
    The mask parameter should be constructed using predefined bit flags that correspond
    to valid map type identifiers in the game engine. Developers should ensure that
    the mask values align with the expected bit positions defined in the core map
    type constants.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the mask value can lead to unexpected behavior in
    spatial queries or collision detection. The mask must be properly constructed
    using valid bit flags, otherwise it may not correctly filter map types as intended.
