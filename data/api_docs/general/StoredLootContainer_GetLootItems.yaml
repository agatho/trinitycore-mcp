  signature: const StoredLootItemContainer & StoredLootContainer::GetLootItems() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the container of stored loot items associated with this loot container.
  description: The GetLootItems method provides access to the collection of loot items
    that have been stored within a specific StoredLootContainer instance. This method
    returns a constant reference to the internal container holding the loot item data,
    allowing read-only access to all items in the loot pool. The returned container
    typically contains information about each item's ID, stack count, and other relevant
    properties. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method is
    commonly used when processing loot drops from creatures or game objects, enabling
    scripts and systems to iterate through and distribute the stored loot items appropriately.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a StoredLootItemContainer that holds all the loot
    items currently stored in this container. This allows for safe read access to
    the loot data without modifying the original container.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Loot Items from a StoredLootContainer
    code: "StoredLootContainer* lootContainer = ...; // Assume this is initialized\n\
      const StoredLootItemContainer& items = lootContainer->GetLootItems();\nfor (const\
      \ auto& item : items)\n{\n    // Process each loot item\n    uint32 itemId =\
      \ item.itemid;\n    uint32 itemCount = item.count;\n    // ... perform actions\
      \ with item data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal data structure, so modifications
    to the container through this reference are not recommended as they may lead to
    undefined behavior. The method is typically used in read-only contexts during
    loot processing or distribution.
