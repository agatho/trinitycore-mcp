documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming chat messages for bot command handling within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The ProcessChatMessage method is responsible for interpreting and executing
    chat commands issued by players or bots in the World of Warcraft environment.
    It analyzes the provided CommandContext to determine the appropriate action, such
    as executing a specific bot command or triggering an in-game response. This method
    integrates with the broader TrinityCore command system to facilitate automated
    bot behavior through chat interactions. The function typically validates input,
    parses command arguments, and routes the request to the relevant handler within
    the bot subsystem. It ensures proper context handling and maintains consistency
    with existing game mechanics and command processing workflows.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a CommandResult enum value indicating the outcome of the chat message
    processing operation. Possible values may include COMMAND_OK for successful execution,
    COMMAND_FAILED for failed attempts, or COMMAND_PENDING for operations requiring
    further processing. The specific return codes depend on the implementation details
    of the bot command handler and the success/failure conditions of the executed
    commands.
  examples:
  - title: Basic chat message processing
    code: "CommandContext context;\n// ... populate context with chat message data\
      \ ...\nBotChatCommandHandler handler;\nCommandResult result = handler.ProcessChatMessage(context);\n\
      if (result == COMMAND_OK) {\n    // Message processed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not block execution
    for extended periods. It relies on the CommandContext being properly initialized
    with valid message data before invocation. The implementation may cache or store
    command state internally, so repeated calls with different contexts are expected
    to work correctly.
  warnings: Ensure that CommandContext contains valid and sanitized input data to
    prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Improperly formatted
    commands may lead to undefined behavior or failed processing attempts.
