  brief: Adds a garrison follower to the player's garrison using the spell effect.
  description: This method adds a garrison follower to the player's garrison through
    the spell effect, typically used in conjunction with other garrison-related spells
    or effects. The method is part of the Spell class and operates within the context
    of World of Warcraft's garrison system, where followers are added to the player's
    garrison based on specific spell mechanics. It does not require any parameters
    and is generally invoked when a spell effect triggers the addition of a follower
    to the garrison.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during spell execution and may involve interaction
    with garrison system mechanics. The implementation relies on internal spell effects
    and should be used carefully within the context of garrison-related gameplay.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper spell handling;
    it is part of a larger spell effect system and must be used in conjunction with
    other related methods or effects to function correctly.
