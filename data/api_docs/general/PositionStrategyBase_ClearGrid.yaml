documentation:
  brief: Clears all grid-related data and resets the position strategy base state.
  description: The ClearGrid method is responsible for resetting the internal grid
    data structure within the PositionStrategyBase class. This operation typically
    invalidates any cached grid information, clears existing grid references, and
    prepares the strategy base for a fresh grid initialization. The method ensures
    that subsequent grid-based positioning calculations start with a clean slate,
    which is essential when switching between different grid configurations or during
    cleanup operations. This method does not take any parameters and performs no return
    value operations.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionStrategyBase strategy;

      strategy.ClearGrid();

      // Grid data has been cleared and reset'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before reinitializing grid data to ensure no
    stale references remain. It's commonly used during map transitions or when resetting
    positioning strategies in dynamic environments.
