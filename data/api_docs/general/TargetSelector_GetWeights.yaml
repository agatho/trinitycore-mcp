  method: GetWeights
  signature: const TargetWeights & TargetSelector::GetWeights() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weight configuration used by the target selector for evaluating
    potential targets.
  description: The GetWeights method provides access to the internal TargetWeights
    object that defines how different factors are weighted when selecting targets
    in combat. This method is typically used by AI systems to determine which target
    is most suitable based on various criteria such as threat level, distance, health
    percentage, and other combat-related metrics. The returned reference allows read-only
    access to the current weight configuration without modifying it. The weights are
    usually pre-configured based on the creature's AI behavior type and difficulty
    settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the TargetWeights object containing all weight
    values used for target selection calculations. This reference remains valid for
    the lifetime of the TargetSelector instance and should not be modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Target Weights in AI Logic
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ target) override {\n        const TargetWeights& weights = selector->GetWeights();\n\
      \        // Use weights for custom target selection logic\n        if (weights.threatWeight\
      \ > 0.5f) {\n            // Apply specific behavior based on threat weight\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TargetWeights reference points to internal data that may be
    shared across multiple AI components. Modifications to the weights should be done
    through dedicated setter methods rather than direct access. This method is thread-safe
    as it only returns a constant reference to existing data.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned TargetWeights object directly, as this can
    lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistent AI decision-making. Always use proper
    setter methods if weight modifications are required.
