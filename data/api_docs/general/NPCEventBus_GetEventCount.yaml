  method: GetEventCount
  signature: uint64 NPCEventBus::GetEventCount(NPCEventType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of events registered for a specific NPC event type.
  description: The GetEventCount method returns the number of events currently registered
    within the NPCEventBus for a given NPCEventType. This method is typically used
    to monitor or debug event registration, ensuring that the correct number of events
    are active for a particular event type. It does not modify any internal state
    and is safe for read-only access. The method is designed to work with the TrinityCore's
    event system, which manages various NPC-related triggers such as gossip events,
    quest events, and combat-related events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total number of events registered for the
    specified NPCEventType. Returns zero if no events are registered for the given
    type or if an invalid event type is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Get Count of Gossip Events
    code: 'uint64 gossipCount = eventBus.GetEventCount(NPCEventType::GOSSIP);

      std::cout << "Gossip events registered: " << gossipCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Event Registration Before Adding New Events
    code: "if (eventBus.GetEventCount(NPCEventType::QUEST) == 0)\n{\n    // No quest\
      \ events registered, safe to add new ones\n    eventBus.RegisterEvent(...);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup operation and is generally fast. It
    should not be called frequently in performance-critical sections of code due to
    potential locking mechanisms in the underlying event bus implementation. The returned
    count reflects only events registered at the time of the call.
  warnings: Ensure that NPCEventType values passed to this method are valid, as invalid
    types may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect counts. This method does not
    validate input parameters, so callers should ensure proper event type usage.
