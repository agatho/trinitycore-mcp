documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the interrupt database for spell and ability interruption
    handling in TrinityCore.
  description: The LoadInterruptDatabase method is responsible for initializing and
    loading the interrupt database used by the TrinityCore server to manage spell
    and ability interruptions. This method typically reads data from database tables
    containing information about which spells or abilities can interrupt others, including
    their priorities, conditions, and interaction rules. It ensures that all interruption
    mechanics are properly set up before gameplay begins, allowing for accurate handling
    of interrupts during combat scenarios. The method is usually invoked during server
    startup or when the game world is initialized, ensuring that all relevant data
    is loaded into memory for efficient runtime processing.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadAllData()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n   \
      \ InterruptUtils::LoadInterruptDatabase();\n    // Continue with other data\
      \ loading...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup and should not be invoked
    repeatedly during runtime. The database loading process may involve reading from
    multiple SQL tables and caching the results in memory for fast lookup during combat.
    It's important to ensure that the underlying database tables contain valid data,
    as malformed entries could cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime can lead to memory leaks
    or inconsistent state. Ensure that all required database tables are properly populated
    with valid interruption rules before calling this method. Improperly configured
    interrupt data may result in incorrect spell behavior during combat.
