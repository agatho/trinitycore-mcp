  signature: void ThreadSafeClassAI::UpdateUtilities(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal utility systems and performs periodic AI calculations for
    the thread-safe class AI instance.
  description: The UpdateUtilities method is responsible for managing and updating
    various internal utility systems within the ThreadSafeClassAI. This method typically
    handles periodic AI logic, state management, and utility computations that are
    essential for maintaining the AI's functionality. It processes time-based updates
    using the provided delta time (diff) parameter to ensure smooth operation of AI
    behaviors. The method is designed to be thread-safe, allowing it to be called
    from multiple threads without causing race conditions or data corruption. This
    function is commonly invoked during game loop iterations to keep AI systems synchronized
    with the current game state.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based AI behaviors and ensure consistent timing
      across different system performance conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateUtilities Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastDiff();\n    if (ai)\n\
      \        ai->UpdateUtilities(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Update Loop
    code: "class MyAI : public ThreadSafeClassAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateUtilities(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        // Perform utility updates\n        if (diff\
      \ > 0)\n        {\n            // Update timers and cooldowns\n            UpdateTimers(diff);\n\
      \            // Process AI decisions\n            ProcessAIDecisions();\n  \
      \      }\n        ThreadSafeClassAI::UpdateUtilities(diff);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain proper
    AI behavior. The diff parameter is crucial for ensuring consistent timing regardless
    of system load or frame rate variations. As a thread-safe implementation, it can
    be safely invoked from different threads, but developers should ensure that any
    shared resources are properly synchronized.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter may cause inconsistent AI behavior
    or timing issues. Never call this method without providing a valid time delta
    value. Be cautious when overriding this method to avoid breaking existing AI functionality.
