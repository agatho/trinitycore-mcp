  method: LoadCreatureFormations
  signature: void FormationMgr::LoadCreatureFormations()
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature formations from the database into memory for AI behavior.
  description: The LoadCreatureFormations method initializes and populates the formation
    data structure with creature group configurations stored in the database. This
    method is typically called during server startup or when reloading formation data.
    It retrieves formation information including leader GUIDs, member GUIDs, formation
    types, and positioning parameters, then constructs internal data structures that
    are used by the AI system to manage group behavior such as following, flanking,
    or defensive formations. The method ensures that all creature formations are properly
    loaded before any AI logic attempts to utilize them.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    sFormationMgr->LoadCreatureFormations();\n    // Continue with other systems...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked during server startup or via a reload command.
    It's important to ensure that the database tables containing formation data (like
    creature_formations) are properly populated before calling this method. The method
    performs no locking internally, so it should be called from a single-threaded
    context during initialization.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started and creatures are already
    in formation may cause inconsistent AI behavior. Avoid calling this method while
    active combat or movement is occurring. Ensure that database entries are valid
    to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.
