  brief: Sends a spirit resurrect message to the player's client indicating they are
    about to be resurrected.
  description: The SendSpiritResurrect method is used by the WorldSession class to
    notify a connected player's client that they are about to be resurrected. This
    method is typically invoked when a player dies and is in the process of being
    revived, either through natural resurrection (such as at a graveyard) or through
    other means like spirit healers. The method prepares and sends the appropriate
    network packet to the client, which triggers visual and auditory effects related
    to resurrection. It's part of the core game mechanics that handle player death
    and revival in World of Warcraft. This method does not perform the actual resurrection
    logic itself but rather communicates the state change to the client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death handling
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // ... other death handling code ...\n\
      \    GetSession()->SendSpiritResurrect();\n    // ... continue with resurrection\
      \ logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the player death sequence before
    the actual resurrection process begins. It's important to note that this method
    only sends the client-side notification and does not affect the server-side player
    state directly. The actual resurrection logic should be handled separately by
    calling appropriate methods like ResurrectPlayer().
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context or after the player has already
    been fully resurrected may cause client-side issues or unexpected behavior. Ensure
    that the session is valid and the player is in a proper death state before invoking
    this method.
