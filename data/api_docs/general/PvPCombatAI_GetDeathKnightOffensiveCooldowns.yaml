  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: GetDeathKnightOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetDeathKnightOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive cooldowns currently active for a Death
    Knight player in PvP combat.
  description: The GetDeathKnightOffensiveCooldowns method is used to determine how
    many offensive abilities are currently on cooldown for a Death Knight class player
    within a PvP environment. This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and is
    typically invoked during AI decision-making processes to evaluate available offensive
    options. The method takes a pointer to a player object and returns an integer
    representing the count of active offensive cooldowns. It's important to note that
    this method only considers offensive abilities that are relevant in PvP combat
    scenarios, excluding defensive or utility cooldowns. The implementation likely
    checks the player's current spell cooldowns and filters them based on the Death
    Knight's offensive ability set.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the Death Knight whose
      offensive cooldowns are being evaluated. This parameter must point to a valid
      Player instance with Death Knight class data.
  returns: An integer value representing the count of offensive cooldowns currently
    active for the specified Death Knight player. Returns 0 if no offensive cooldowns
    are active or if the input player pointer is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myDeathKnight = ...; // Assume this points to a valid Death Knight\
      \ player\nint cooldownCount = pvpCombatAI->GetDeathKnightOffensiveCooldowns(myDeathKnight);\n\
      if (cooldownCount > 0) {\n    // Process the cooldown information\n    printf(\"\
      Death Knight has %d offensive cooldowns active\\n\", cooldownCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void PvPCombatAI::MakeOffensiveDecision(Player* player) {\n    if (player->getClass()\
      \ == CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT) {\n        int cooldowns = GetDeathKnightOffensiveCooldowns(player);\n\
      \        // If no offensive cooldowns, use powerful abilities\n        if (cooldowns\
      \ == 0) {\n            UseFrostStrike(player);\n        } else {\n         \
      \   // Choose alternative based on cooldown state\n            UseBloodStrike(player);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is specifically designed for PvP combat scenarios and may not
    accurately reflect the full cooldown state of a Death Knight in PvE situations.
    The implementation likely uses internal tracking mechanisms to identify which
    abilities are considered 'offensive' for PvP purposes. Developers should ensure
    that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and represents a Death
    Knight class before calling to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null player pointer to this method may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the player object is properly
    initialized and represents a Death Knight class before invoking this method. The
    returned count may not include all possible cooldowns if certain abilities are
    excluded from PvP-specific tracking.
