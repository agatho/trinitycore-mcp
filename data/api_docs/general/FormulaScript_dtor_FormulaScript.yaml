documentation:
  brief: Destroys a FormulaScript instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The FormulaScript destructor is responsible for cleaning up any dynamically
    allocated memory or resources that were used by the FormulaScript instance. This
    method is automatically invoked when a FormulaScript object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource management and prevents memory
    leaks within the TrinityCore framework's scripting system. The destructor typically
    handles cleanup of internal data structures, registered callbacks, or any other
    resources that may have been allocated during the object's lifetime.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of FormulaScript
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    FormulaScript* script = new FormulaScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }\n\n// Or with automatic storage:\nvoid AnotherFunction()\n{\n    FormulaScript\
      \ script;\n    // Destructor automatically called when script goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was allocated
    on the heap. It is important to ensure that all references to the FormulaScript
    are cleared before destruction to avoid dangling pointers. The implementation
    may include cleanup of registered event handlers or other internal state management.
