documentation:
  brief: Initializes the client opcode table with all supported client-to-server opcodes.
  description: The InitializeClientOpcodes method sets up the internal mapping of
    client opcodes used in the TrinityCore server. This function is responsible for
    populating the opcode table with all known client-to-server message types that
    the server can receive and process. It typically runs during server initialization
    to ensure that all supported network protocols are correctly registered. The method
    prepares the server's ability to interpret incoming packets from connected clients
    based on their protocol version and supported opcodes.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'OpcodeTable opcodeTable;

      opcodeTable.InitializeClientOpcodes();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server startup. It's typically
    invoked automatically by the core initialization process and shouldn't be called
    manually in most cases. The method may perform operations that are not thread-safe,
    so it should be executed before any client connections are accepted.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times or after the server has started processing
    connections can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. It's crucial to ensure
    this initialization happens only once during the server's boot sequence.
