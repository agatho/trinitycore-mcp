  class: Ticket
  method: GetAssignedPlayer
  signature: Player * Ticket::GetAssignedPlayer() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Player object assigned to handle this ticket.
  description: The GetAssignedPlayer method returns a pointer to the Player object
    that is currently assigned to process and manage this support ticket. In the context
    of TrinityCore's ticketing system, tickets are created by players to report issues
    or request assistance, and they can be assigned to specific staff members (Players)
    for resolution. This method allows code to access the assigned staff member's
    data directly, which may be useful for checking availability, logging actions,
    or determining if a ticket is still being handled. The returned pointer may be
    null if no player has been assigned to the ticket yet.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object assigned to this ticket, or nullptr if no
    player is currently assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Check Assigned Player Before Processing
    code: "if (Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid)) {\n    Player*\
      \ assignedPlayer = ticket->GetAssignedPlayer();\n    if (assignedPlayer) {\n\
      \        // Ticket is assigned, proceed with handling\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Ticket %u is assigned to %s.\", ticketGuid, assignedPlayer->GetName());\n  \
      \  } else {\n        // No assignment yet, assign this player\n        ticket->SetAssignedPlayer(this);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any locking or thread safety checks internally.
    If used in a multi-threaded environment where tickets might be modified concurrently,
    external synchronization should be considered. The returned Player pointer is
    valid only as long as the assigned player object exists and has not been deleted.
  warnings: The returned Player pointer can be null, so always check for nullptr before
    dereferencing it. Failing to do so will result in a crash if no player is assigned
    to the ticket.
