  method: GetContainer
  signature: uint64 StoredLootContainer::GetContainer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the stored loot container.
  description: The GetContainer method retrieves the globally unique identifier (GUID)
    associated with a StoredLootContainer instance. This GUID represents the specific
    game object or entity that holds the loot, such as a corpse, chest, or container.
    The method is typically used in loot management systems to identify which container's
    contents are being accessed or processed. It provides a consistent way to reference
    the container across different parts of the TrinityCore system without needing
    to maintain additional lookup tables.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the GUID of the stored loot container. This
    identifier uniquely identifies the game object that contains the loot, such as
    a creature's corpse or a game object like a treasure chest.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and log container GUID
    code: 'StoredLootContainer* container = player->GetLoot();

      uint64 containerGuid = container->GetContainer();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("loot", "Container GUID: %u", containerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly returns the internal GUID member
    variable. It does not perform any validation or lookup operations, making it very
    efficient. The returned GUID can be used to query the GameObject or Unit that
    owns this loot container through the ObjectAccessor system.
