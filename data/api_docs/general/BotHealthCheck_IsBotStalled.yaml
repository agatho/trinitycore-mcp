  signature: bool BotHealthCheck::IsBotStalled(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot is stalled or stuck in its current position
  description: The IsBotStalled method determines whether a specific bot, identified
    by its GUID, is currently stalled or unable to make progress. This check typically
    evaluates the bot's movement state, position changes over time, and other relevant
    factors to detect if the bot has become stuck. The method returns true when the
    bot is determined to be stalled, which may trigger corrective actions such as
    repositioning or path recalculation. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    bot behavior quality in World of Warcraft environments where bots must navigate
    complex terrain and avoid getting trapped.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to check for stalling status.
      This should be a valid GUID representing a bot entity within the TrinityCore
      framework.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot is detected as stalled or stuck, false
    otherwise. A stalled bot typically cannot make progress in its movement path and
    may require intervention.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a bot is stalled
    code: "if (botHealthCheck->IsBotStalled(botGuid)) {\n    // Handle the stalled\
      \ bot case\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Bot with GUID {} is stalled.\", botGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsBotStalled in a periodic health check loop
    code: "void BotHealthCheck::UpdateBotStatus() {\n    for (auto& bot : activeBots)\
      \ {\n        if (IsBotStalled(bot->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n            //\
      \ Trigger recovery mechanism\n            bot->ResetMovement();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of bot movement deltas, time
    intervals, and possibly collision detection to determine stalling. It may be called
    frequently during AI update cycles, so performance is important. The implementation
    might use a threshold-based approach where if no significant position change occurs
    over multiple updates, the bot is considered stalled.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid parameter corresponds to an actual active bot
    entity; passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior.
    This method should not be used as the sole indicator for bot recovery since false
    positives might occur due to network latency or temporary pathfinding issues.
