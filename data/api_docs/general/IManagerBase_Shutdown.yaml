  signature: void IManagerBase::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the shutdown sequence for the manager, gracefully terminating all
    active processes and cleaning up resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for safely shutting down a manager
    instance by terminating any running processes, releasing allocated memory, and
    performing necessary cleanup operations. This method ensures that all subsystems
    managed by the IManagerBase are properly closed in an orderly fashion to prevent
    resource leaks or data corruption. It is typically invoked during server shutdown
    or when a manager needs to be restarted. The method does not return any value
    and should only be called once per manager instance, as subsequent calls may result
    in undefined behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'IManagerBase* manager = GetManager();

      manager->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    with other manager operations. It is recommended to call Shutdown before destroying
    the manager instance to ensure proper cleanup.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown multiple times on the same manager instance may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all dependent systems are properly
    disconnected before invoking this method.
