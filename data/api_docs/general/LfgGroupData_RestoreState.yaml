  method: RestoreState
  signature: void LfgGroupData::RestoreState()
documentation:
  brief: Restores the LFG group's previous state, including all queued players and
    role assignments.
  description: The RestoreState method is used to revert an LFG (Looking for Group)
    group data object back to its previously saved state. This typically occurs when
    a group member leaves or is removed from a dungeon finder queue, allowing the
    system to restore the group's original configuration including all queued players,
    their roles, and other relevant LFG data. The method ensures that the group can
    continue functioning as if no disruptions occurred during the queue process. It
    is commonly invoked internally by the TrinityCore LFG system when managing group
    stability and player rejoining scenarios.

  examples:
  - title: Restoring LFG Group State After Player Departure
    code: "LfgGroupData* groupData = sLFGMgr->GetGroupData(playerGuid);\nif (groupData)\n\
      {\n    groupData->RestoreState();\n    // Group state has been restored to previous\
      \ configuration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a prior state has been saved using a corresponding
    SaveState() function. The implementation relies on internal data structures maintained
    by the LFG manager and should only be called in appropriate contexts where group
    state restoration is required.
  warnings: Calling RestoreState without a previously saved state may result in undefined
    behavior or loss of group data. This method should not be used outside of the
    LFG subsystem's control flow to avoid corrupting queue management logic.
