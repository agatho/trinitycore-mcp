  signature: uint32 DeathKnightAI::GetRunicPowerCost(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the runic power cost for a specified Death Knight
    spell.
  description: The GetRunicPowerCost method determines the amount of runic power required
    to cast a specific Death Knight spell. This method is used internally by the AI
    system to evaluate spell viability and resource management during combat. It takes
    into account various factors such as spell properties, player specialization,
    and current game state to accurately compute the cost. The returned value represents
    the exact runic power expenditure needed for the spell execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the runic power cost required to cast
    the specified Death Knight spell. A value of 0 indicates no runic power cost or
    an invalid spell ID was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 cost = ai->GetRunicPowerCost(49998); // Frost Strike\nif (cost >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n    if (player->GetRunicPower()\
      \ >= cost)\n        player->CastSpell(target, 49998, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Management Check
    code: "uint32 spellId = 50842; // Death Coil\nuint32 cost = ai->GetRunicPowerCost(spellId);\n\
      if (cost > 0 && player->GetRunicPower() >= cost)\n{\n    // Spell can be cast\
      \ safely\n    player->CastSpell(target, spellId, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Insufficient runic power, consider alternative spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI decision-making
    logic to ensure proper resource allocation. The calculation may be affected by
    talents, buffs, or debuffs that modify runic power costs. This function should
    only be called when the Death Knight AI has valid access to spell data and player
    state information.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    Death Knight spell; invalid IDs may return unexpected results. The method assumes
    the AI context is properly initialized and that the player object has valid runic
    power state information.
