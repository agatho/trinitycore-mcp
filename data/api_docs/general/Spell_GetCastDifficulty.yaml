documentation:
  brief: Returns the cast difficulty level of the spell
  description: This method retrieves the difficulty level associated with a spell's
    casting, which determines the game mode and difficulty settings for spell execution.
    The returned value represents the specific difficulty tier that the spell is configured
    to use, such as normal, heroic, or mythic modes. This is particularly relevant
    when dealing with spells that have different effects based on difficulty levels,
    such as those used in raid encounters or dungeon instances. The method ensures
    proper handling of game mechanics related to spell casting and difficulty selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the Difficulty enum value representing the cast difficulty level
    of the spell. This typically corresponds to normal, heroic, or mythic difficulty
    settings, with possible values including DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL, DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC,
    and DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_MYTHIC.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Difficulty diff = spell->GetCastDifficulty();\nif (diff == DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL)\n\
      {\n    // Handle normal difficulty spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine the full context of spell execution. It is commonly used during spell
    casting or when determining spell effects based on difficulty settings.
  warnings: This method may return invalid difficulty values if the spell has not
    been properly initialized or configured for difficulty-based effects. Care should
    be taken when using this method in conjunction with other spell-related APIs to
    ensure proper handling of difficulty settings.
