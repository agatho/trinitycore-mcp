  class: ConditionMgr
  method: IsObjectMeetToConditionList
  signature: bool ConditionMgr::IsObjectMeetToConditionList(ConditionSourceInfo &
    sourceInfo, const ConditionContainer & conditions) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether an object meets all conditions in a given condition list.
  description: The IsObjectMeetToConditionList method checks if a specified object,
    represented by ConditionSourceInfo, satisfies all the conditions defined in a
    ConditionContainer. This method is used extensively in TrinityCore for validating
    various game mechanics such as quest requirements, item usage restrictions, NPC
    gossip options, and spell targeting rules. It iterates through each condition
    in the container and evaluates them against the provided source information, returning
    true only if all conditions are met. The method supports complex conditional logic
    including logical operators and nested conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceInfo
    description: Reference to ConditionSourceInfo containing the object context and
      data needed for condition evaluation. This includes the type of object, its
      GUID, and associated variables that conditions may reference.
  - name: conditions
    description: Const reference to ConditionContainer holding the list of conditions
      that must be evaluated against the source object. Each condition in the container
      defines a specific requirement or constraint.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether all conditions in the container are satisfied
    by the provided source object. Returns true if all conditions pass, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Quest Requirements
    code: 'ConditionSourceInfo sourceInfo;

      sourceInfo.SetType(CONDITION_SOURCE_TYPE_QUEST);

      sourceInfo.SetGUID(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));


      ConditionContainer questConditions;

      // Add conditions for quest requirements

      bool meetsRequirements = sConditionMgr->IsObjectMeetToConditionList(sourceInfo,
      questConditions);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating NPC Gossip Options
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->IsObjectMeetToConditionList(sourceInfo, gossipConditions))\n\
      {\n    // Show gossip option\n    player->ADD_GOSSIP_ITEM(GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT,\
      \ \"This option is available\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs deep evaluation of all conditions in the container,
    which may have performance implications for large condition sets. The method assumes
    that sourceInfo and conditions are properly initialized before calling. It's commonly
    used in conjunction with other ConditionMgr methods like GetConditionMap() to
    retrieve pre-defined condition sets.
  warnings: Ensure that ConditionSourceInfo is correctly populated with valid object
    data, as invalid or missing data may lead to unexpected evaluation results. Be
    cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths due to potential
    iteration over multiple conditions.
