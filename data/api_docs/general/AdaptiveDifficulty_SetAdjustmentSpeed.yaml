  class: AdaptiveDifficulty
  method: SetAdjustmentSpeed
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::SetAdjustmentSpeed(float speed)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the adjustment speed for adaptive difficulty scaling in World of Warcraft.
  description: The SetAdjustmentSpeed method configures how quickly the adaptive difficulty
    system modifies the difficulty level of encounters based on player performance.
    This parameter controls the rate at which the system responds to changes in group
    composition, player skill, or encounter completion times. The adjustment speed
    affects the smoothness and responsiveness of difficulty scaling during dynamic
    content such as raids or dungeons. A higher value results in more aggressive adjustments,
    while a lower value leads to smoother but slower transitions. This method is typically
    used internally by the adaptive difficulty system and may be called during instance
    initialization or configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: speed
    description: A float value representing the rate at which difficulty adjustments
      occur. Higher values (e.g., 2.0) cause faster adjustments, while lower values
      (e.g., 0.5) result in slower, more gradual changes. Values should typically
      be positive and greater than zero.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Fast Difficulty Adjustment
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty* diff = sWorld->GetAdaptiveDifficulty();

      diff->SetAdjustmentSpeed(2.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Slow Adaptive Response
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty* diff = sWorld->GetAdaptiveDifficulty();

      diff->SetAdjustmentSpeed(0.5f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive difficulty system that dynamically adjusts
    encounter difficulty based on player performance metrics. It's important to note
    that adjustment speed only affects how quickly changes are applied, not the actual
    difficulty calculation logic. The value should be tuned carefully to avoid abrupt
    difficulty shifts that could impact player experience.
  warnings: Setting extremely high adjustment speeds may cause difficulty fluctuations
    that disrupt gameplay balance. Values too low might make the system unresponsive
    to meaningful changes in group performance. Ensure that this setting is consistent
    with your server's intended difficulty curve and player skill distribution.
