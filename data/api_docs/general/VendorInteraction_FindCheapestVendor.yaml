api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: FindCheapestVendor
  signature: uint32 VendorInteraction::FindCheapestVendor(uint32 itemId, const int
    & vendorGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the GUID of the cheapest vendor offering a specified item.
  description: The FindCheapestVendor method searches through all available vendors
    in the game world to locate the one selling a specific item at the lowest price.
    It takes an item ID as input and returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the vendor
    offering that item for the least amount of money. This functionality is commonly
    used by players or NPCs to optimize purchasing decisions, ensuring they obtain
    items at the most cost-effective rates. The method iterates through vendor inventories,
    compares prices, and selects the vendor with the minimal cost for the given item.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to search for among vendors. Must
      be a valid item entry from the game's database.
  - name: vendorGuids
    description: A reference to an integer representing a list or set of vendor GUIDs
      to consider in the search. This parameter may be used to limit the scope of
      vendors searched, such as filtering by faction or specific vendor types.
  returns: Returns the GUID (unique identifier) of the vendor who offers the specified
    item at the lowest price. If no vendor is found with the given item, it returns
    0, indicating an error or invalid result.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nint vendorGuids = 0; // Search all vendors\nuint32\
      \ cheapestVendor = VendorInteraction::FindCheapestVendor(itemId, vendorGuids);\n\
      if (cheapestVendor != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with purchase from the returned\
      \ vendor\n    printf(\"Cheapest vendor GUID: %u\\n\", cheapestVendor);\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    printf(\"No vendor found for item %u\\n\", itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Specific Vendor Filter
    code: "uint32 itemId = 12345;\nint vendorGuids = 1000; // Example filter for a\
      \ specific faction or group\nuint32 cheapestVendor = VendorInteraction::FindCheapestVendor(itemId,\
      \ vendorGuids);\nif (cheapestVendor != 0)\n{\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(cheapestVendor);\n\
      \    if (player && player->IsVendor())\n    {\n        // Perform transaction\
      \ logic here\n        printf(\"Found cheapest vendor for item %u at GUID %u\\\
      n\", itemId, cheapestVendor);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that vendors are properly initialized and accessible
    within the game world. It may not account for temporary discounts or dynamic pricing
    changes during runtime. Performance can be impacted when searching across a large
    number of vendors, especially if vendorGuids is not filtered.
  warnings: "Ensure that the itemId provided corresponds to an actual item in the\
    \ database; otherwise, the method will return 0. Be cautious when using vendorGuids\
    \ as a filter\u2014incorrectly formatted or invalid GUIDs may lead to unexpected\
    \ behavior or incomplete results."
