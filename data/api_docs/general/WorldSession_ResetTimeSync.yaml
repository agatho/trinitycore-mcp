  method: ResetTimeSync
  signature: void WorldSession::ResetTimeSync()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the time synchronization state for the session, clearing any previously
    recorded time offsets.
  description: The ResetTimeSync method clears the time synchronization data associated
    with a WorldSession. This is typically used when a client reconnects or when time
    synchronization needs to be restarted. The method ensures that subsequent time-related
    communications between the server and client are properly synchronized. It resets
    internal time offset tracking variables, which are crucial for maintaining accurate
    game time across networked sessions. This function is part of TrinityCore's network
    time management system, helping to prevent time drift issues in multiplayer environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset time sync on player disconnect
    code: "void HandlePlayerDisconnect(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    // Reset time\
      \ sync when player disconnects\n    session->ResetTimeSync();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset time sync during reconnection process
    code: "void HandleReconnect(WorldSession* session)\n{\n    // Clear existing time\
      \ sync data before reinitializing\n    session->ResetTimeSync();\n    // Proceed\
      \ with reconnection logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a new time synchronization sequence
    is about to begin. It's typically invoked during session initialization or reconnection
    scenarios. The method does not perform any network operations itself but prepares
    internal state for new time synchronization.
  warnings: Calling this method while active time synchronization is in progress may
    cause temporary time drift issues until the next synchronization cycle completes.
    Ensure that this method is only called when it's safe to reset the time offset
    tracking.
