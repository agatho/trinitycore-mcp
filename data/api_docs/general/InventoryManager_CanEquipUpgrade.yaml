  signature: bool InventoryManager::CanEquipUpgrade(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item can be equipped as an upgrade for the player's
    current equipment.
  description: The CanEquipUpgrade method evaluates if a given item is eligible to
    be equipped in place of the player's currently equipped items. This check considers
    factors such as item level requirements, class and race restrictions, inventory
    slot compatibility, and whether the item is already equipped. The method does
    not perform actual equipment changes but returns a boolean indicating if the upgrade
    would be valid. It is typically used before attempting to equip an item to prevent
    invalid operations or to provide feedback to the player about why an item cannot
    be equipped.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item can be equipped as an upgrade, false otherwise.
    A return value of false indicates that the item either does not meet requirements
    for equipping (e.g., level too low, class restriction, incompatible slot) or is
    already equipped in a higher priority slot.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Item Can Be Equipped
    code: "Item* newItem = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);\nif (newItem && player->GetInventory()->CanEquipUpgrade(newItem))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with equipping the item\n    player->GetInventory()->EquipItem(newItem);\n\
      } else {\n    // Inform player that item cannot be equipped\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Cannot equip this item.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not check for inventory space or whether the item is in
    the player's bag. It only evaluates if the item can be equipped in a valid slot
    based on existing equipment and item properties. The method may perform checks
    against the player's current gear to determine upgrade eligibility.
  warnings: Do not rely solely on this method for final validation before equipping
    an item, as other conditions (like inventory space or cooldowns) might still prevent
    the actual equip operation. This method does not modify any state and is purely
    a check function.
