documentation:
  brief: Creates an area trigger effect associated with the spell.
  description: The EffectCreateAreaTrigger method is responsible for spawning an area
    trigger object in the game world when a spell effect is applied. This method is
    typically invoked during the execution of spells that require persistent area-based
    effects, such as aura triggers, trap placements, or environmental effects. The
    created area trigger will remain active for a specified duration and can be configured
    to affect players or creatures within its radius. It integrates with TrinityCore's
    spell system to ensure proper lifecycle management and interaction with other
    game systems.

    code: "void Spell::EffectCreateAreaTrigger()\n{\n    if (!m_caster || !m_targets.GetDst())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Create area trigger at target location\n    AreaTrigger*\
      \ trigger = new AreaTrigger();\n    trigger->SetOwner(m_caster);\n    trigger->SetSpellId(m_spellInfo->Id);\n\
      \    trigger->SetPosition(m_targets.GetDst()->GetPosition());\n    trigger->SetDuration(m_spellInfo->GetDuration());\n\
      \    m_caster->AddGameObject(trigger);\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the spell effect processing pipeline and should only
    be called during active spell execution. The area trigger created will automatically
    clean up after its duration expires, but developers must ensure proper ownership
    and reference management to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Improper handling of area triggers can lead to memory leaks or invalid
    object references. Always verify that m_caster and target positions are valid
    before creating the trigger. Do not call this method outside of spell effect execution
    context.
