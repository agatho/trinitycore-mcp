  method: SetPlayerLocalFlag
  signature: void Player::SetPlayerLocalFlag(PlayerLocalFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a player local flag to control specific gameplay behaviors and states.
  description: The SetPlayerLocalFlag method allows developers to set specific flags
    that influence player behavior within the game world. These flags are used internally
    by TrinityCore to manage various gameplay mechanics, such as player state, visibility,
    and interaction with the environment. The method operates on a predefined set
    of flags that determine how the player interacts with the game system, including
    but not limited to visibility settings, movement restrictions, and interaction
    states. This method is typically used during player initialization or when changing
    player states to ensure proper gameplay behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The PlayerLocalFlags enum value that defines which flag to set. This
      parameter determines the specific behavior being controlled by the flag, such
      as visibility, movement, or interaction state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetPlayerLocalFlag(PLAYER_LOCAL_FLAG_1);

      // This sets a specific flag to control player behavior'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetPlayerLocalFlag(PLAYER_LOCAL_FLAG_2);

      // This sets a flag that affects player movement and visibility

      // The flag is used to control how the player interacts with the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method directly modifies internal player flags
    that are used by TrinityCore''s core systems. Developers should be aware that
    these flags are not exposed through standard API interfaces but rather controlled
    through internal mechanisms. Performance considerations: The method is lightweight
    and does not involve complex operations, making it safe to use in frequent calls
    during gameplay. Thread safety: This method is generally thread-safe as long as
    the player object itself is properly synchronized.'
  warnings: This method should only be used when explicitly required by game mechanics
    or when working with specific flags that are known to affect player behavior.
    Using incorrect flags can lead to unexpected player behavior or state issues.
    Common mistakes include setting flags without understanding their effects, which
    may cause players to become invisible or unable to interact with the world.
