  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetWalk
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetWalk(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables walking mode for a spline movement.
  description: The SetWalk method configures whether a character's movement uses walking
    or running speed. When enabled, the character will move at walk speed; when disabled,
    the character will use run speed. This method affects the movement spline initialization
    and is typically used during pathfinding or movement state changes. The setting
    takes effect immediately on subsequent movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable walking mode (true) or
      disable it (false). When true, movement speed is reduced to walk speed; when
      false, movement speed returns to run speed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Walking Mode
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetWalk(true); // Enable walking mode'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Walking Mode
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetWalk(false); // Disable walking mode (return to running)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal movement state of the spline initializer.
    It does not directly affect the character's current movement but will influence
    any new movement operations that use this initializer. The change is applied to
    subsequent path calculations and movement execution.
