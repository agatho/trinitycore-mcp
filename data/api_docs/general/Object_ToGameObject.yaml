documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the GameObject object if the current Object is a game
    object, otherwise returns nullptr.
  description: The ToGameObject method serves as a type conversion utility that allows
    developers to safely cast an Object pointer to a GameObject pointer when the Object
    is actually a GameObject instance. This method is essential for performing type-specific
    operations on game objects within the TrinityCore framework. It is commonly used
    in scenarios where object types need to be determined dynamically, such as in
    event handling or when dealing with various object types that share a common base
    class. The method performs a dynamic cast and returns nullptr if the object is
    not a GameObject, making it a safe way to access GameObject-specific properties
    and methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const pointer to the GameObject object if the current Object
    instance is a GameObject; otherwise returns nullptr. This indicates that the method
    can be used to determine if an Object is actually a GameObject or not, allowing
    for safe type casting operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* gameObj = obj->ToGameObject();\nif (gameObj != nullptr)\n{\n\
      \    // Object is a GameObject\n    // Perform GameObject-specific operations\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Object is not a GameObject\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires careful handling as it involves dynamic casting. The
    implementation checks if the object is actually a GameObject before returning
    the pointer, which may have performance implications in high-frequency operations.
    It should be used judiciously in performance-critical code sections.
  warnings: The method does not perform any validation or safety checks beyond the
    type conversion itself. Using this method without proper checks can lead to undefined
    behavior if the object is not actually a GameObject. Developers should ensure
    that they properly validate the object type before using this method.
