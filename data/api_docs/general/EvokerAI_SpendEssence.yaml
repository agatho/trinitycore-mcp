  method: SpendEssence
  signature: void EvokerAI::SpendEssence(int amount)
documentation:
  brief: Spends the specified amount of essence for an evoker AI.
  description: The SpendEssence method is used by the EvokerAI class to consume a
    given amount of essence, which is a core resource in the evoker's gameplay mechanics.
    This method likely reduces the evoker's current essence pool and may trigger related
    actions such as casting spells or updating UI elements. It serves as a fundamental
    part of the evoker's ability management system within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of essence to be spent. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the quantity of essence units to consume.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Essence Spending
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = ...;

      evoker->SpendEssence(50); // Spend 50 units of essence'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Essence Spending
    code: "EvokerAI* evoker = ...;\nif (evoker->GetEssence() >= 100) {\n    evoker->SpendEssence(100);\
      \ // Spend 100 units if enough essence is available\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the evoker's internal essence tracking
    system and may have side effects such as updating spell cooldowns or triggering
    aura effects. Ensure that the amount passed does not exceed the current essence
    available to prevent negative values.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may cause undefined behavior
    or resource corruption. Always validate the amount parameter before invoking this
    method to ensure it represents a valid, non-negative quantity of essence.
