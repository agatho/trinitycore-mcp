  class: Creature
  method: GetCorpseDelay
  signature: uint32 Creature::GetCorpseDelay() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the delay before a creature's corpse disappears after death.
  description: The GetCorpseDelay method retrieves the time in seconds that a creature
    will remain as a corpse before it is removed from the world. This value is typically
    determined by the creature's level and the game rules for corpse decay timing.
    The delay is usually set to a default value based on the creature's level, with
    higher-level creatures having longer corpse delays. This method is used primarily
    in game mechanics to control how long corpses remain visible and accessible to
    players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the number of seconds that the creature's corpse will remain before
    being removed from the world. This value represents the delay time between death
    and corpse disappearance, typically ranging from 10-30 seconds depending on creature
    level and game rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 delay = creature->GetCorpseDelay();\n// This will return the corpse\
      \ delay in seconds\nif (delay > 0)\n{\n    // Process the delay value\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's core game mechanics and affects how
    long corpses remain visible to players. The delay is typically set based on creature
    level and can be modified by game rules or server settings. This method should
    be used carefully as it affects player experience and loot behavior.
  warnings: The returned value may vary depending on creature level and server configuration.
    Be aware that this value might be different from what you expect if the creature
    is a high-level boss or elite creature, which could affect loot distribution timing.
