  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ActivateStrategy
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ActivateStrategy(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a behavior strategy based on the provided flags for adaptive AI
    decision making.
  description: The ActivateStrategy method in AdaptiveBehaviorManager is responsible
    for enabling or activating specific behavioral strategies within the AI system.
    It takes a set of flags that define which strategies should be active, allowing
    the AI to dynamically adjust its behavior based on game conditions, player actions,
    or other environmental factors. This method typically integrates with the broader
    adaptive AI framework to ensure that appropriate behaviors are triggered at the
    right time during gameplay. The activation process may involve initializing strategy
    components, setting internal state variables, and potentially modifying the AI's
    decision-making logic.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask value representing the strategies to be activated. Each
      bit corresponds to a specific behavior strategy within the adaptive AI system.
      Valid values are defined by the AI strategy flag constants, such as STRATEGY_FLAG_COMBAT,
      STRATEGY_FLAG_MOVEMENT, etc. The method will activate all strategies represented
      by the set bits in the flags parameter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activate Combat and Movement Strategies
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAI()->GetBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->ActivateStrategy(STRATEGY_FLAG_COMBAT | STRATEGY_FLAG_MOVEMENT);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Activate All Available Strategies
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = player->GetAI()->GetBehaviorManager();

      behaviorManager->ActivateStrategy(STRATEGY_FLAG_ALL);

      // This would activate all defined strategies in the AI system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or when game conditions
    change that require new behaviors to be enabled. The implementation may involve
    checking for existing active strategies and avoiding redundant activation. It's
    important to understand that activating a strategy doesn't immediately change
    the AI's behavior; it merely makes the strategy available for selection by the
    AI decision-making process.
  warnings: Calling ActivateStrategy with invalid or undefined flag values may result
    in unexpected behavior or errors. Ensure that all flags used are properly defined
    within the AI system. Additionally, activating too many strategies simultaneously
    might impact performance, especially in high-density combat scenarios where multiple
    AI entities are active.
