documentation:
  brief: Destroys the bot spawner instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotSpawner interface is responsible for releasing
    all allocated memory and cleaning up any internal resources used by the bot spawner.
    This method ensures that when a bot spawner object is no longer needed, all associated
    data structures, pointers, and system resources are properly deallocated to prevent
    memory leaks. In the context of TrinityCore's AI framework, this destructor may
    also handle cleanup of spawned bots or related game entities. The method should
    be called automatically by the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of bot spawner
    code: 'IBotSpawner* spawner = new BotSpawnerImpl();

      // ... use the spawner ...

      delete spawner; // Triggers ~IBotSpawner()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic destruction via smart pointer
    code: '#include <memory>

      std::unique_ptr<IBotSpawner> spawner = std::make_unique<BotSpawnerImpl>();

      // ... use the spawner ...

      // Destructor called automatically when spawner goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically invoked by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    Developers should ensure that no virtual methods are called from within this destructor,
    as the object's vtable may already be partially destroyed. It's recommended to
    avoid throwing exceptions in destructors.
  warnings: Never call virtual methods from a destructor, as the derived class portion
    of the object may already be destroyed. Also, ensure that any cleanup performed
    by this destructor does not rely on other objects that might have already been
    destroyed.
