  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: CreateTurnInBatch
  signature: TurnInBatch QuestTurnIn::CreateTurnInBatch(Player * bot, const int &
    questIds)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a TurnInBatch object for processing multiple quest turn-ins
    for a specified player.
  description: The CreateTurnInBatch method is used to initialize a TurnInBatch object
    that manages the processing of multiple quest turn-ins for a given player. This
    method allows bots or automated systems to efficiently handle several quest completions
    in a single operation, reducing overhead and improving performance. The TurnInBatch
    object returned can then be used to iterate through available quests, validate
    requirements, and process turn-ins sequentially. It is particularly useful in
    botting scenarios where multiple quests need to be turned in automatically without
    manual intervention.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or character that
      will be processing the quest turn-ins.
  - name: questIds
    description: 'Reference to an integer containing the quest ID(s) to be included
      in the batch. Note: This parameter appears to be incorrectly defined as a single
      int rather than a collection, which may limit functionality.'
  returns: Returns a TurnInBatch object that encapsulates the batch processing context
    for quest turn-ins. This object provides methods to iterate over quests, validate
    prerequisites, and execute turn-in operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      int questId = 12345;

      TurnInBatch batch = QuestTurnIn::CreateTurnInBatch(myBot, questId);

      // Use batch to process turn-ins'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Quests
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint questIds[] = {12345, 12346, 12347};\nfor (int i\
      \ = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    TurnInBatch batch = QuestTurnIn::CreateTurnInBatch(bot,\
      \ questIds[i]);\n    // Process each quest turn-in\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in automated systems such as bots. The parameter
    definition suggests it might be intended to accept multiple quest IDs but is currently
    defined as a single integer, which could limit its utility. Consider updating
    the signature to accept a collection of quest IDs for full functionality.
  warnings: The current method signature accepts only one quest ID, which may not
    align with typical batch processing expectations. Ensure that the questIds parameter
    correctly handles multiple values if this is intended behavior. Improper usage
    may result in incomplete or incorrect turn-in processing.
