  signature: int PathfindingManager::ClampToWorldBounds(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Clamps a position value to valid world boundaries.
  description: The ClampToWorldBounds method ensures that a given position value remains
    within the acceptable range of world coordinates. This is particularly important
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment where invalid positions could lead
    to undefined behavior or client disconnections. The method typically validates
    and adjusts coordinate values against predefined minimum and maximum bounds for
    the current map or zone. It serves as a safety mechanism to prevent out-of-bounds
    errors during pathfinding operations or object placement.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer position value that needs to be clamped to
      valid world boundaries. This parameter represents a coordinate value (such as
      X, Y, or Z axis position) that may exceed the valid range of the game world.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the clamped position value that is guaranteed
    to be within valid world bounds. If the input position was already within bounds,
    it returns the original value unchanged.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for clamping a coordinate
    code: 'int xCoord = 15000;

      PathfindingManager* pathfinder = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager();

      int clampedX = pathfinder->ClampToWorldBounds(xCoord);

      // clampedX will be within valid world bounds, even if xCoord exceeds them'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a pathfinding context
    code: "class MyPathfinder\n{\npublic:\n    void ValidateAndProcessPath(std::vector<int>&\
      \ waypoints)\n    {\n        for (auto& waypoint : waypoints)\n        {\n \
      \           waypoint = sObjectMgr->GetPathfindingManager()->ClampToWorldBounds(waypoint);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by pathfinding algorithms to ensure
    that calculated waypoints remain within valid world boundaries. It's crucial for
    maintaining game stability and preventing client-side errors caused by invalid
    coordinates. The actual boundary limits are determined by the current map's configuration
    and may vary between different zones or instances.
  warnings: Using this method with incorrect parameter types or without proper validation
    can lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that the input position represents a valid
    coordinate before calling this method, as passing invalid data types could cause
    undefined behavior.
