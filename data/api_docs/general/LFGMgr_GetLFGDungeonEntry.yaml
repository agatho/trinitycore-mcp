  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetLFGDungeonEntry
  signature: uint32 LFGMgr::GetLFGDungeonEntry(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the dungeon entry ID associated with a given LFG dungeon identifier.
  description: The GetLFGDungeonEntry method is used to obtain the corresponding dungeon
    entry ID for a specified LFG (Looking For Group) dungeon ID. This function serves
    as a lookup mechanism within the TrinityCore's LFG system, mapping internal dungeon
    identifiers to their respective dungeon entry values which are often required
    for dungeon-related operations such as group matching, queue management, and reward
    distribution. The method is typically invoked when processing LFG dungeon data
    or validating player dungeon requests. It assumes that the provided ID corresponds
    to a valid LFG dungeon entry within the system's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier of the LFG dungeon for which to retrieve the
      dungeon entry. This value should correspond to a valid dungeon ID defined in
      the LFG system's configuration.
  returns: Returns the dungeon entry ID associated with the provided LFG dungeon ID.
    If the input ID does not map to a valid dungeon entry, the method may return zero
    or trigger an assertion depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 dungeonEntry = sLFGMgr->GetLFGDungeonEntry(1234);\nif (dungeonEntry\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with dungeon operations using the entry ID\n    printf(\"\
      Dungeon Entry ID: %u\\n\", dungeonEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG Queue
    code: "uint32 lfgId = player->GetLFGDungeon();\nuint32 entryId = sLFGMgr->GetLFGDungeonEntry(lfgId);\n\
      if (entryId != 0)\n{\n    // Validate dungeon eligibility or prepare for instance\
      \ creation\n    player->SetDungeonEntry(entryId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal LFG dungeon data structures and should only
    be called after the LFG system has been initialized. The returned entry ID is
    typically used in conjunction with other LFG or instance-related APIs to manage
    player groupings and dungeon access.
  warnings: Ensure that the input ID parameter is validated before calling this method,
    as invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This function
    does not perform bounds checking on the input ID.
