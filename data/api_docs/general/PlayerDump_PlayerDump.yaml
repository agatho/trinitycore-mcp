  brief: Moves a player dump object to another player dump object, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The PlayerDump::PlayerDump constructor is a move constructor that transfers
    ownership of resources from a temporary PlayerDump object to a new PlayerDump
    instance. This allows for efficient resource management by avoiding unnecessary
    copying of data structures. The method is typically used internally during object
    creation or assignment operations where a temporary PlayerDump object needs to
    be moved into a persistent one. It's part of the standard C++ move semantics implementation
    and follows the typical pattern of consuming an rvalue reference to efficiently
    transfer state without deep copying.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to a PlayerDump object that will be moved from.
      This parameter represents the source of the resource transfer and is consumed
      during the move operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Constructor Usage
    code: 'PlayerDump dump1;

      // ... populate dump1 with data ...

      PlayerDump dump2 = std::move(dump1); // Move constructor called here'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in Function Context
    code: "PlayerDump createDump() {\n    PlayerDump dump;\n    // ... populate dump\
      \ ...\n    return dump; // Move constructor used for return value optimization\n\
      }\n\nPlayerDump mainDump = createDump();"
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no
    user-defined move constructor exists. It performs a member-wise move of all data
    members, which is efficient for simple classes. The source object after a move
    operation should not be used in any meaningful way as its resources have been
    transferred.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source PlayerDump object should
    not be accessed or used, as its internal state has been moved and may be left
    in an undefined or unusable state.
