  method: SendChatRestricted
  signature: void WorldSession::SendChatRestricted(ChatRestrictionType restriction)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a chat restriction notification to the connected client.
  description: "The SendChatRestricted method is used to inform a player's client\
    \ that they are currently restricted from sending chat messages. This typically\
    \ occurs when a player has been muted, silenced, or otherwise prevented from chatting\
    \ due to game rules, moderation actions, or temporary restrictions. The method\
    \ sends a specific protocol message to the client that displays an appropriate\
    \ error message and prevents further chat input until the restriction is lifted.\
    \ This functionality is integral to maintaining game\u79E9\u5E8F and enforcing\
    \ chat policies within the World of Warcraft environment."
  parameters:
  - name: restriction
    description: The type of chat restriction to apply. This parameter specifies the
      nature of the restriction (e.g., muted, silenced) which determines the appropriate
      client-side message and behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a mute restriction
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      session->SendChatRestricted(ChatRestrictionType::CHAT_RESTRICTION_MUTE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending a silence restriction
    code: "if (player->HasAura(SPELL_AURA_SILENCE)) {\n    session->SendChatRestricted(ChatRestrictionType::CHAT_RESTRICTION_SILENCE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly communicates with the client's chat system and should
    only be called when a player's chat privileges are actually restricted. The restriction
    type parameter must correspond to valid enum values defined in the TrinityCore
    chat system. This method does not modify any server-side state; it only sends
    the appropriate message to the client.
  warnings: Ensure that the restriction type passed is valid and corresponds to actual
    game restrictions. Sending incorrect restriction types may cause client-side errors
    or unexpected behavior. This method should not be called for players who have
    no active chat restrictions, as it may confuse the client's state management.
