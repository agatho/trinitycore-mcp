  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateLevelingEvent(int * leader, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates a guild leveling event by processing the leader's data and event
    identifier.
  description: The CoordinateLevelingEvent method in the GuildEventCoordinator class
    is responsible for managing guild-related leveling events within the TrinityCore
    framework. It processes input parameters to determine how a guild should respond
    to a leveling event, potentially updating guild member levels, distributing rewards,
    or triggering related game mechanics. The method takes a pointer to an integer
    representing the guild leader's identifier and a uint32 event ID to specify the
    type of leveling event occurring. This function is typically invoked during gameplay
    when guild members reach new level thresholds or when specific guild events are
    triggered that affect member progression.
  parameters:
  - name: leader
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild leader's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to identify which guild leader's data should
      be processed during the leveling event.
  - name: eventId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific type of leveling
      event to coordinate. This ID corresponds to predefined event types within the
      TrinityCore system that dictate how the guild members' progression should be
      handled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int guildLeaderGuid = 12345;

      uint32 eventId = 1001;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateLevelingEvent(&guildLeaderGuid, eventId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild data structures and may
    trigger additional game events or updates. It should be called only when a valid
    guild leader GUID is provided to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer for the leader parameter may result
    in segmentation faults or corrupted data. Ensure that the eventId corresponds
    to a valid event type defined in the TrinityCore system.
