  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureTemplate(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature template data from the database into memory for use in the
    game world.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplate method initializes and populates creature
    templates within the ObjectMgr class by reading data from the database. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when reloading creature data to ensure
    that all creature definitions are available for spawning NPCs in the game world.
    It processes the raw database fields and constructs internal representations of
    creature templates, which are then used by other systems to create and manage
    creature instances. The method operates on a per-creature-template basis, ensuring
    that each unique creature type has its properties properly configured before being
    referenced during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureTemplate();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the data loading sequence. It's important to note that this method should only
    be called after the database connection has been established and is functional.
    The method modifies internal data structures in ObjectMgr, so concurrent access
    during execution should be avoided.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries. Additionally, if the database contains invalid
    or corrupted creature template data, this method may fail silently or cause unexpected
    behavior in creature spawning.
