  class: SmartAI
  method: SetData
  signature: void SmartAI::SetData(uint32 id, uint32 value, Unit * invoker)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a data value associated with a specific ID for use in SmartAI behavior
    scripting.
  description: The SetData method allows SmartAI to store and retrieve integer data
    values associated with unique identifiers. This functionality is commonly used
    in AI scripts to track state information, such as quest progress, event triggers,
    or custom flags that influence NPC behavior. The method accepts an ID to identify
    the data slot, a value to store, and an optional invoker unit which may be used
    for context or validation purposes. Data set via this method can typically be
    retrieved later using GetAI()->GetData() or similar accessors within SmartAI scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: A unique identifier (ID) used to associate and retrieve the data
      value. This ID is typically defined by the scripter and must match between SetData
      and GetData calls.
  - name: value
    description: The integer value to be stored under the specified ID. This can represent
      any numeric state information relevant to the AI behavior.
  - name: invoker
    description: An optional pointer to a Unit that invoked this action. May be used
      for context or validation within SmartAI scripts, but not always required.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetData to track quest progress
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    // Mark\
      \ that the quest has been accepted\n    SetData(QUEST_ACCEPTED_ID, 1, player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a custom flag for AI decision making
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* who)\n{\n    // Set a flag indicating combat has\
      \ started\n    SetData(COMBAT_STARTED_FLAG, 1, who);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The data stored using this method is typically persistent within the AI context
    for the duration of the creature's existence or until overwritten. It is not automatically
    saved to database and should be used carefully in scenarios where state persistence
    across reloads is required.
  warnings: Ensure that ID values are unique and consistent between SetData and GetData
    calls to avoid data corruption or unexpected behavior. Avoid using large or negative
    values for IDs as they may cause issues with internal storage mechanisms.
