  signature: void RuneResource::ConsumeRunes(uint32 blood, uint32 frost, uint32 unholy)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes specified amounts of blood, frost, and unholy runes for a player's
    death knight class ability usage.
  description: The ConsumeRunes method is used to deduct specified quantities of blood,
    frost, and unholy runes from a player's rune resource pool. This method is typically
    invoked when a death knight uses an ability that requires rune consumption, such
    as Death Strike, Blood Boil, or other rune-based spells. The method updates the
    internal rune state by reducing the available count of each rune type according
    to the provided parameters. It ensures that sufficient runes are available before
    consumption and handles the logic for rune regeneration timers if applicable.
    This method is integral to the death knight's resource management system in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: blood
    description: The number of blood runes to consume (0-128). Valid values are integers
      representing the count of blood runes required for the ability being used.
  - name: frost
    description: The number of frost runes to consume (0-128). Valid values are integers
      representing the count of frost runes required for the ability being used.
  - name: unholy
    description: The number of unholy runes to consume (0-128). Valid values are integers
      representing the count of unholy runes required for the ability being used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune consumption for a death knight ability
    code: 'RuneResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneResource();

      // Consume 1 blood rune and 1 frost rune for a basic attack

      runeResource->ConsumeRunes(1, 1, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming all three rune types for a powerful death knight spell
    code: 'RuneResource* runeResource = player->GetRuneResource();

      // Consume 1 of each rune type for a high-damage ability

      runeResource->ConsumeRunes(1, 1, 1);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has sufficient runes available before
    calling. The actual rune consumption logic may involve checking rune cooldowns
    and updating internal timers. This method is part of the death knight's resource
    management system and should only be called on players with the death knight class.
    The method does not directly handle visual effects or sound cues; these are managed
    separately by the client.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that sufficient runes exist may
    lead to negative rune counts, which could cause undefined behavior in the game's
    resource management system. Always ensure proper validation of rune availability
    before calling this method. Improper usage can result in character state corruption
    or unexpected gameplay behavior.
