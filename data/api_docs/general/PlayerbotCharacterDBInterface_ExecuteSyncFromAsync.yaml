  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: ExecuteSyncFromAsync
  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::ExecuteSyncFromAsync(int * stmt,
    int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a database statement synchronously from an asynchronous context
    within the player bot character interface.
  description: The ExecuteSyncFromAsync method allows execution of a database statement
    that was initiated asynchronously, ensuring thread-safe and synchronous completion
    of the operation. This is particularly useful in TrinityCore's playerbot system
    where database operations must be carefully managed to avoid race conditions or
    deadlocks. The method handles the transition from asynchronous execution context
    back to synchronous execution, making it suitable for scenarios where immediate
    database results are required after background processing. It ensures that database
    transactions and queries are properly synchronized with the main game thread while
    maintaining performance by deferring actual execution until needed.
  parameters:
  - name: stmt
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the database statement identifier
      or handle that needs to be executed synchronously
  - name: callback
    description: Integer value representing a callback function identifier or index
      used to handle completion events of the synchronous execution
  returns: void, indicating no return value is provided by this method
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteSyncFromAsync
    code: 'int statementId = 12345;

      int callbackId = 67890;

      playerbotCharacterDBInterface->ExecuteSyncFromAsync(&statementId, callbackId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within an asynchronous execution context
    where database operations are pending. It's designed to bridge the gap between
    async-initiated operations and synchronous completion requirements in TrinityCore's
    playerbot framework. The implementation likely involves internal thread synchronization
    mechanisms to ensure safe access to database resources.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may lead to deadlocks or race conditions
    if not properly coordinated with the asynchronous execution flow. Developers must
    ensure that the statement handle and callback identifiers are valid before calling
    this method, as invalid parameters could cause undefined behavior in the database
    subsystem.
