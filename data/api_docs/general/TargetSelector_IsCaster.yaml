documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified unit is a caster class or has caster abilities.
  description: The IsCaster method evaluates whether a given Unit object represents
    a character or creature that is classified as a caster. This typically includes
    classes such as Mages, Priests, Warlocks, and other spellcasters in World of Warcraft.
    The method checks various attributes and flags associated with the unit to determine
    if it can cast spells or possesses caster-specific behavior. It's commonly used
    in AI decision-making processes for target selection and spell casting logic within
    TrinityCore's combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is classified as a caster, false otherwise.
    A caster unit typically has spell-casting capabilities and may possess specific
    flags or class types that distinguish it from melee or ranged attackers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (targetSelector->IsCaster(victim)) {\n    // Prioritize casting damaging\
      \ spells on this target\n    DoSpellAttack(victim, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Use melee attack instead\n    DoMeleeAttack(victim);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Filtering Caster Targets for AoE Spells
    code: "std::vector<Unit*> casterTargets;\nfor (auto& target : possibleTargets)\
      \ {\n    if (targetSelector->IsCaster(target)) {\n        casterTargets.push_back(target);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Now use casterTargets for area-of-effect spell targeting"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal class flags and spell casting capabilities
    defined in the TrinityCore database. It may not account for temporary status effects
    that change a unit's casting ability. The implementation likely checks against
    predefined caster classes or spell school affiliations rather than dynamic behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths,
    as it may involve multiple internal checks. Also, ensure the target pointer is
    valid before calling to avoid crashes.
