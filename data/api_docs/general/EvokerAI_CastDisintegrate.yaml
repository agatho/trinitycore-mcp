  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastDisintegrate
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastDisintegrate(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Disintegrate spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastDisintegrate method is responsible for executing the Disintegrate
    spell cast by an Evoker AI unit. This method takes a pointer to an integer representing
    the target unit and performs the necessary actions to initiate the spell casting
    sequence, including validating the target, checking if the spell can be cast,
    and applying the spell effect. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this method would typically be invoked during the AI's decision-making process
    when it determines that Disintegrate is an appropriate ability to use against
    the current target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit for the Disintegrate
      spell. The value pointed to should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature,
      or Player GUID.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastDisintegrate
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        CastDisintegrate(&target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's spell casting system and may include
    checks for line of sight, mana availability, and target validity. It is expected
    to be called from within an AI update loop or decision-making context.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit before calling this
    method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. The method assumes proper initialization of the AI's spell casting capabilities.
