  brief: Updates the mistweaver monk's current state including mana, cooldowns, and
    active abilities.
  description: The UpdateMistweaverState method is responsible for maintaining and
    updating the internal state of a Mistweaver Monk class instance within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes managing resource levels such as mana, tracking active
    buffs and debuffs, handling ability cooldowns, and ensuring that the monk's spellcasting
    behavior aligns with current game mechanics and player actions. The method typically
    runs during each AI update cycle to ensure real-time accuracy of the character's
    condition and readiness for next actions. It may also synchronize state changes
    with the game server to maintain consistency across all connected clients.
