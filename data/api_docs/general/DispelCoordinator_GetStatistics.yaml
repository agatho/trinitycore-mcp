  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & DispelCoordinator::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistical data of the dispel coordinator.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics object that holds various performance and usage metrics for the DispelCoordinator.
    This method allows external systems or modules to access aggregated data about
    dispel operations, such as total dispels performed, success rates, and other relevant
    statistics without modifying the underlying data structure. The returned Statistics
    object is immutable, ensuring that callers cannot alter the internal state of
    the coordinator through this interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing aggregated dispel
    operation metrics including counts, success rates, and performance data.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing dispel statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = dispelCoordinator.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalDispels = stats.totalDispels;

      float successRate = stats.successRate;

      printf("Total dispels: %u, Success rate: %.2f%%\n", totalDispels, successRate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is a snapshot of the current state and does
    not update automatically. Callers should be aware that subsequent calls to GetStatistics()
    may return different values if the coordinator's internal state has changed.
