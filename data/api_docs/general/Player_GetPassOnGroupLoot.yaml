api:
  class: Player
  method: GetPassOnGroupLoot
  signature: bool Player::GetPassOnGroupLoot() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the player is set to pass on group loot.
  description: This method checks if the player has enabled the "pass on group loot"
    option, which means they will not receive loot from group instances and will instead
    let other players in their group pass on the loot. This setting is typically used
    when players want to avoid taking loot that might be better suited for other group
    members, or when they are trying to prevent loot distribution conflicts within
    their group. The method returns true if the player has set this option, false
    otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has enabled pass on group loot, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "bool passOnGroupLoot = player->GetPassOnGroupLoot();\nif (passOnGroupLoot)\n\
      {\n    // Player will not receive loot from group instances\n    // This is\
      \ useful for managing loot distribution in groups\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related settings
    and can be toggled via the player's loot settings menu. It is important to note
    that this setting only affects group loot, not solo loot or world loot.
  warnings: This method does not directly affect the player's ability to receive loot
    from instances; it only affects their behavior when they are in a group with other
    players. Be careful when using this method in conjunction with other loot settings,
    as it may lead to unexpected loot distribution outcomes.
