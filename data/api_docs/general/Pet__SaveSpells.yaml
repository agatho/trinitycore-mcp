documentation:
  brief: Saves the pet's spell database to the database with an optional transaction.
  description: The _SaveSpells method persists the current state of a pet's spell
    book to the database. It is typically invoked when changes to the pet's learned
    spells need to be committed, such as when a spell is added or removed from the
    pet's spell list. The method accepts an optional transaction parameter that allows
    the save operation to be part of a larger database transaction, ensuring data
    consistency across multiple related operations. This method is generally called
    internally by the Pet class and should not be invoked directly by external code
    unless specifically required for transactional integrity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Transaction Context
    code: "void SavePetSpells(Pet* pet)\n{\n    // Begin a transaction\n    WorldDatabaseTransaction\
      \ trans = WorldDatabase.BeginTransaction();\n    \n    // Save pet spells with\
      \ transaction\n    pet->_SaveSpells(trans);\n    \n    // Commit the transaction\n\
      \    WorldDatabase.CommitTransaction(trans);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal helper function and should not be called directly
    by external systems. It assumes that the pet's spell data has already been modified
    and is ready to be persisted. The transaction parameter allows for atomic updates
    when multiple database changes are required.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method without proper transaction handling may
    lead to inconsistent data states in the database. This method should only be used
    within a valid database transaction context to ensure data integrity.
