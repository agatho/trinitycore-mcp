documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is too high level for the player to accept.
  description: The IsQuestTooHighLevel method checks if the specified quest's required
    level exceeds the player's current level, making the quest ineligible for acceptance.
    This method is typically used during quest interaction to validate whether a player
    can take on a given quest based on their character's level. It helps enforce game
    balance by preventing players from accepting quests that are significantly above
    their capability level. The check considers the quest's minimum required level
    and compares it against the player's actual level.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest's required level is higher than the player's
    current level, indicating the quest is too high level for the player to accept.
    Returns false if the quest's level requirement is within acceptable range for
    the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest acceptance logic
    code: "if (!player->GetQuestManager()->IsQuestTooHighLevel(quest)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Inform\
      \ player that quest is too high level\n    player->SendNotification(\"This quest\
      \ is too high level for you.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the player's current level and the quest's minimum
    required level to make the comparison. It may also consider other factors such
    as quest level scaling or player's level cap. The implementation should be efficient
    since it's called frequently during quest interactions.
