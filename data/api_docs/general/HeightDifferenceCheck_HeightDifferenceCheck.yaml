  class: HeightDifferenceCheck
  method: HeightDifferenceCheck
  signature: void HeightDifferenceCheck::HeightDifferenceCheck(int * go, float diff,
    bool reverse)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the height difference between two objects meets a specified threshold.
  description: The HeightDifferenceCheck method evaluates whether the vertical distance
    between two game objects (such as a player and a GameObject) exceeds a given threshold.
    This functionality is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore for determining
    if an object is at a sufficient height difference to trigger certain game mechanics,
    such as spell effects, quest conditions, or environmental interactions. The method
    takes a pointer to a GameObject, a float representing the required height difference,
    and a boolean flag indicating whether the check should be reversed (i.e., if the
    height difference should be less than or equal to the threshold).
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject whose height will be compared. This parameter
      must point to a valid GameObject instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: diff
    description: The minimum required height difference (in yards) between the player
      and the GameObject. Must be a non-negative value.
  - name: reverse
    description: If true, checks if the height difference is less than or equal to
      the specified threshold. If false, checks if it's greater than the threshold.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Height Difference Check
    code: 'HeightDifferenceCheck* check = new HeightDifferenceCheck();

      GameObject* go = player->GetMap()->GetGameObject(ObjectGuid(12345));

      check->HeightDifferenceCheck(go, 5.0f, false); // Check if height difference
      is > 5 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reverse Height Difference Check
    code: 'HeightDifferenceCheck* check = new HeightDifferenceCheck();

      GameObject* go = player->GetMap()->GetGameObject(ObjectGuid(12345));

      check->HeightDifferenceCheck(go, 2.0f, true); // Check if height difference
      is <= 2 yards'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning data from both the player and
    the GameObject. It should be used carefully in performance-critical code paths
    as it may involve multiple coordinate calculations. The method assumes that both
    entities have valid position data and are within the same map instance.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'go' will result in undefined behavior. Ensure
    that the GameObject exists and is properly initialized before calling this method.
    The 'diff' parameter should be carefully chosen to avoid false positives or negatives
    in game logic.
