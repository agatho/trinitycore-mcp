  signature: bool CorpsePreventionManager::PreventCorpseAndResurrect(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Prevents a player's corpse from being created and stops resurrection mechanics
    for that player.
  description: The PreventCorpseAndResurrect method is designed to inhibit the normal
    corpse creation process and associated resurrection behavior for a specified player
    character. This functionality is typically used in bot management systems or custom
    game mechanics where players should not be able to create corpses or be resurrected
    through standard means. The method likely modifies internal flags or state variables
    within the CorpsePreventionManager to disable these behaviors. It returns true
    if the prevention was successfully applied, and false otherwise. This method is
    particularly relevant in automated bot systems or custom game modes where normal
    player death mechanics need to be overridden.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the corpse and resurrection prevention was successfully
    applied to the player, false if the operation failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot System
    code: "if (corpsePreventionManager.PreventCorpseAndResurrect(botPlayer)) {\n \
      \   // Corpse and resurrection are now prevented for botPlayer\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Corpse and resurrection prevented for bot: %s\", botPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n\
      } else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to prevent corpse and resurrection for\
      \ bot: %s\", botPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player state flags and may require
    proper initialization of the CorpsePreventionManager before use. It should be
    called before a player dies to prevent corpse creation, or during death processing
    to override default behavior.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method could lead to inconsistent game state or
    unexpected behavior in player death mechanics. Ensure that the player parameter
    is valid and that the manager has been properly initialized before calling this
    method.
