  class: WorldSession
  method: SendTaxiStatus
  signature: void WorldSession::SendTaxiStatus(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends taxi status information to the client for a specified GUID.
  description: The SendTaxiStatus method is used to transmit taxi service availability
    and status information to a player's client. This method typically sends data
    about whether the player can use taxi services, which taxi nodes are available,
    and any restrictions or requirements for using those services. It is part of the
    WorldSession class and is invoked when the server needs to update the client on
    taxi-related game state changes. The method takes a GUID parameter that identifies
    the specific object (usually a player or NPC) whose taxi status should be sent.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier of the object (typically a player or NPC) for
      which taxi status information is being sent. This value determines which taxi
      data will be transmitted to the client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Taxi Status for a Player
    code: "WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();\nif (session)\n{\n    session->SendTaxiStatus(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the server when taxi-related
    events occur, such as when a player enters a taxi node area or when their taxi
    service status changes. The actual implementation likely constructs and sends
    a packet containing taxi node data to the client.
