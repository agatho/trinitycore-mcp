  class: Creature
  method: SetLootMode
  signature: void Creature::SetLootMode(uint16 lootMode)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot mode for a creature, determining how loot is distributed among
    players.
  description: The SetLootMode method configures the loot mode for a Creature object,
    which controls how loot is distributed when the creature is killed. This method
    affects the behavior of loot distribution within the game world, particularly
    in relation to group loot rules and individual player loot settings. The loot
    mode determines whether players receive loot through rolling, free loot, or other
    distribution mechanisms based on the creature's configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: lootMode
    description: The loot mode value to set for the creature. Valid values are typically
      0-255, where 0 represents default loot mode (no special behavior), and higher
      values may indicate specific loot modes such as 'LootMode' or 'Group Loot' settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Loot Mode to 1
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetLootMode(1);

      // This sets the creature''s loot mode to a specific value, enabling group loot
      distribution'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods
    and should be called before the creature is killed. The implementation may vary
    depending on the TrinityCore version and specific game mechanics being applied.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot distribution behavior,
    potentially causing players to receive no loot or unexpected loot items. Care
    must be taken when setting loot modes to ensure compatibility with group loot
    rules and player settings.
