  brief: Sorts vendor items by their sell priority for optimal inventory management.
  description: The SortBySellPriority method reorders the items in a vendor's inventory
    based on predefined sell priorities, typically used to determine the most profitable
    sequence for selling items to players. This method is part of the VendorInteraction
    class and modifies the internal item list to reflect the sorted order. It ensures
    that items with higher sell values or strategic importance are prioritized during
    transactions. The sorting algorithm considers factors such as item value, rarity,
    and demand to optimize the vendor's selling behavior.

    method. The sorting logic may vary depending on the vendor type and game context.
  warnings: Calling this method with an uninitialized or invalid item array can lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure all items are valid before invoking the sort operation.
