documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a snapshot of global quest completion metrics across the entire
    server instance
  description: The GetGlobalCompletionMetrics method returns a comprehensive snapshot
    of quest completion statistics for the entire TrinityCore server. This includes
    overall completion rates, player participation data, and aggregated quest progress
    information. The returned snapshot is a read-only representation of the current
    state at the time of the call, capturing metrics such as total quests completed,
    active quests, and completion percentages across all players in the realm. This
    method is typically used for administrative monitoring, server analytics, and
    tracking overall player engagement with the quest system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestCompletionMetrics::Snapshot object containing aggregated quest completion
    statistics including total quests, completed quests, active quests, and various
    completion percentages across all players in the realm. The snapshot is immutable
    and represents a point-in-time view of global quest metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Server Analytics
    code: 'QuestCompletionMetrics::Snapshot metrics = sQuestCompletion->GetGlobalCompletionMetrics();

      uint32 totalQuests = metrics.totalQuests;

      uint32 completedQuests = metrics.completedQuests;

      float completionRate = (float)completedQuests / totalQuests * 100.0f;

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Global Quest Completion Rate: %.2f%%", completionRate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full aggregation of all player quest data, which may
    have performance implications on high-traffic servers. The returned snapshot is
    thread-safe and does not reflect real-time changes during the call. For frequent
    monitoring, consider caching results or using periodic sampling rather than calling
    this method excessively.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently can cause performance degradation on large
    servers with many active players. The snapshot data may become stale immediately
    after retrieval since it represents a static point-in-time view. Avoid using this
    in high-frequency loops or combat-related code paths.
