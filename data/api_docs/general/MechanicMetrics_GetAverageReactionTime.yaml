  class: MechanicMetrics
  method: GetAverageReactionTime
  signature: float MechanicMetrics::GetAverageReactionTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average reaction time of mechanics in milliseconds.
  description: The GetAverageReactionTime method computes the mean reaction time across
    all tracked mechanical interactions within the system. This value represents how
    quickly the game's AI or systems respond to specific triggers or events, typically
    measured in milliseconds. The method aggregates data from internal tracking mechanisms
    and returns a floating-point representation of this average. It is commonly used
    for performance monitoring, debugging, or tuning gameplay responsiveness. The
    calculation may include various reaction types such as spell casting delays, movement
    reactions, or interaction responses depending on the implementation scope.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the average reaction time in milliseconds. Returns
    zero if no valid data points exist to compute an average.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float avgReactionTime = mechanicMetrics.GetAverageReactionTime();

      std::cout << "Average reaction time: " << avgReactionTime << " ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "MechanicMetrics metrics;\n// ... some gameplay events occur ...\nfloat\
      \ average = metrics.GetAverageReactionTime();\nif (average > 100.0f) {\n   \
      \ // Log warning for high reaction times\n    sLog->outString(\"Warning: High\
      \ average reaction time detected (%.2f ms)\", average);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking data that must be populated before
    calling. The accuracy of the result depends on sufficient data points being recorded.
    The implementation may cache results for performance, so frequent calls might
    return stale values if new data is not regularly added.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior initialization or data collection may
    lead to inaccurate or misleading results. Ensure that the MechanicMetrics object
    has been properly updated with relevant reaction time measurements before invoking
    this function.
