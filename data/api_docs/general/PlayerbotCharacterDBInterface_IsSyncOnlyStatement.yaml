  signature: bool PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::IsSyncOnlyStatement(uint32 statementId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a database statement is synchronized only and should not
    be executed in asynchronous context.
  description: The IsSyncOnlyStatement method checks if a given database statement
    ID corresponds to a statement that must be executed synchronously. This is used
    in the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface to ensure certain database operations are
    completed before proceeding, particularly important for character state management
    and bot behavior synchronization. The method typically returns true for statements
    that modify critical player data or require immediate consistency. It helps maintain
    data integrity when dealing with concurrent access patterns in a multi-threaded
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the statement identified by statementId is designated as
    synchronous-only, meaning it must be executed in a blocking manner rather than
    being queued for asynchronous execution. Returns false if the statement can be
    safely executed asynchronously.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Statement Requires Synchronous Execution
    code: "uint32 myStatementId = 12345;\nif (playerbotDbInterface->IsSyncOnlyStatement(myStatementId))\
      \ {\n    // Handle this statement synchronously\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbots\"\
      , \"Statement {} requires synchronous execution\", myStatementId);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Allow asynchronous processing\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"playerbots\", \"Statement\
      \ {} can be processed asynchronously\", myStatementId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the database interface to determine
    execution context for statements. It's important to understand that synchronous
    statements may impact performance if overused, as they block other operations
    until completion.
