  class: BloodDeathKnight
  method: BloodDeathKnight
  signature: void BloodDeathKnight::BloodDeathKnight(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Blood Death Knight AI bot with the specified player character.
  description: The BloodDeathKnight constructor initializes a Death Knight AI bot
    specifically configured for the Blood specialization. This method sets up the
    bot's behavior, abilities, and combat strategy tailored for Blood Death Knights.
    It typically handles initialization of the AI state, ability selection, resource
    management, and combat routines specific to the Blood specialization. The method
    expects a valid Player pointer representing the bot character that will be controlled
    by this AI implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Blood Death Knight
      AI bot to be initialized. Must not be null and must represent a valid Death
      Knight character with Blood specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = new Player();

      // ... initialize bot properties ...

      BloodDeathKnight bloodDK(myBot);

      // Bot is now initialized with Blood Death Knight AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal AI state variables, sets up
    ability cooldown tracking, and configures combat routines specific to the Blood
    Death Knight's damage mitigation and self-healing mechanics. The implementation
    may also set up target selection logic optimized for Blood specialization priorities.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and represents a properly
    initialized Death Knight character before calling this constructor. Passing a
    null or invalid pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
