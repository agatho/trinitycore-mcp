  signature: float AuctionHouse::GetCompetitorUndercutRate(uint32 sellerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the rate at which competitor auctions are undercut
    by the specified seller.
  description: The GetCompetitorUndercutRate method determines the frequency with
    which a given seller's auction items are undercut by other sellers in the auction
    house system. This metric is used to evaluate competitive behavior within the
    auction house, helping to understand how aggressively a seller is pricing their
    items relative to others. The method likely analyzes historical auction data and
    price comparisons to compute this rate, which can be useful for balancing gameplay
    economics and player behavior analysis. It does not require any input parameters
    beyond the seller's GUID, which identifies the specific player whose undercutting
    behavior is being evaluated.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the rate of competitor undercutting
    for the specified seller. A value of 0.0 indicates no undercutting occurred, while
    higher values indicate more frequent undercutting by competitors. The exact scale
    and interpretation may depend on internal auction house calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Undercut Rate for a Seller
    code: 'uint32 sellerGuid = 123456;

      float undercutRate = auctionHouse->GetCompetitorUndercutRate(sellerGuid);

      TC_LOG_INFO("auctionhouse", "Seller %u has undercut rate: %.2f", sellerGuid,
      undercutRate);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries or accesses cached auction data
    to determine undercutting patterns. It may be computationally expensive if called
    frequently for many sellers. The returned value is typically used internally by
    the auction house system for balancing purposes and may not directly correspond
    to a player-facing statistic.
  warnings: The method assumes that sellerGuid refers to a valid player in the auction
    house system. Invalid or non-existent GUIDs may result in undefined behavior or
    incorrect calculations. This function should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    code paths.
