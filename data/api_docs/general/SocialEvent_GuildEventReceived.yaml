  class: SocialEvent
  method: GuildEventReceived
  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::GuildEventReceived(int player, uint64 guildId,
    std::string message)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a SocialEvent object representing a guild event received
    by a player.
  description: The GuildEventReceived method constructs a SocialEvent instance that
    represents a guild-related event notification sent to a player. This method is
    typically used within the TrinityCore framework to handle in-game guild communications,
    such as guild announcements, member join/leave events, or other guild-specific
    notifications. The returned SocialEvent object can then be processed by the social
    system to display appropriate messages or trigger related game mechanics. The
    method requires a player identifier, guild identifier, and an event message to
    properly construct the event.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who received the guild
      event. This should be a valid player account ID or character GUID.
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild associated with the event.
      This represents the specific guild that generated or is related to the notification.
  - name: message
    description: A string containing the message content of the guild event. This
      text is typically displayed to the player in the social interface or chat system.
  returns: A SocialEvent object representing the guild event received by the specified
    player. The returned object contains all necessary information about the event
    including player, guild, and message details for further processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GuildEventReceived
    code: "SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::GuildEventReceived(12345, 67890, \"Guild\
      \ meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 20:00\");\n// Process the event through\
      \ social system\nif (event.IsValid()) {\n    // Display or handle the guild\
      \ event\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling guild event in a game context
    code: "void HandleGuildEvent(int playerId, uint64 guildId, const std::string&\
      \ msg) {\n    SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::GuildEventReceived(playerId,\
      \ guildId, msg);\n    // Send to player's social interface\n    Player* player\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player, playerId));\n  \
      \  if (player) {\n        player->SendSocialEvent(event);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore social system and should be used in
    conjunction with other SocialEvent methods for complete event handling. The SocialEvent
    object returned by this method may require additional processing before being
    displayed to players. Ensure that player and guild identifiers are valid before
    calling this method to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid player or guild IDs may result in undefined
    behavior or failed event delivery. Always validate input parameters before invoking
    this method. The returned SocialEvent object must be properly managed to avoid
    memory leaks or access violations.
