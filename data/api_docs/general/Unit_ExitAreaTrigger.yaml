  class: Unit
  method: ExitAreaTrigger
  signature: void Unit::ExitAreaTrigger(int * areaTrigger)
documentation:
  brief: ExitAreaTrigger instructs a unit to leave an area trigger.
  description: This method handles the process of a unit exiting an area trigger,
    typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework for managing player
    or creature interactions with area triggers. It allows for proper cleanup and
    notification of the area trigger's exit event, ensuring that the game state is
    correctly updated when a unit leaves an area trigger's influence. The method is
    commonly used in conjunction with EnterAreaTrigger to manage area trigger behavior
    during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTrigger
    description: Pointer to the area trigger object that the unit is exiting. This
      parameter represents the specific area trigger being exited by the unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      int* areaTrigger = nullptr;

      unit->ExitAreaTrigger(areaTrigger);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a unit (player or NPC) leaves the radius
    of an area trigger. It may be used in conjunction with other methods like EnterAreaTrigger
    to manage trigger state transitions. The implementation should ensure proper cleanup
    of trigger references and notify relevant systems.
  warnings: Improper handling of area trigger references can lead to memory leaks
    or invalid memory access. Care must be taken when using this method in conjunction
    with other area trigger related methods.
