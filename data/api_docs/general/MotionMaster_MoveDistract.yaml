  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveDistract
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveDistract(uint32 time, float orientation)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a distracted movement behavior for a creature, causing it to move
    in a random direction for a specified duration.
  description: The MoveDistract method instructs a creature's AI to enter a distracted
    state where it will move in a random direction for the given time period. This
    movement is typically used to simulate a creature being momentarily distracted
    by external factors such as noise or visual stimuli. The orientation parameter
    allows setting a specific facing direction, though it may be overridden during
    the distraction animation. This method is commonly used in AI scripting to create
    more dynamic and realistic creature behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: time
    description: Duration in milliseconds for which the creature will remain in the
      distracted state. Specifies how long the movement animation should last before
      returning to normal AI behavior.
  - name: orientation
    description: The facing direction (in radians) that the creature should orient
      towards during the distraction. If set to 0, the creature will use its current
      facing direction or a random orientation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distraction Usage
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveDistract(3000, 0.0f); // Distract for 3 seconds

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Directed Distraction with Specific Orientation
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->GetMotionMaster()->MoveDistract(2000, M_PI); // Distract for 2 seconds
      facing backwards

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interrupts any current movement or AI behavior. The distraction
    animation typically uses a predefined idle animation with random movement offsets.
    The time parameter should be carefully chosen to avoid excessive disruption of
    normal gameplay flow.
  warnings: Calling MoveDistract while the creature is already in motion may cause
    unexpected behavior or animation glitches. This method does not guarantee that
    the creature will actually move; it only initiates the distraction state which
    may be overridden by other AI events.
