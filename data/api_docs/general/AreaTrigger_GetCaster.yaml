  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetCaster
  signature: Unit * AreaTrigger::GetCaster() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit that cast the AreaTrigger.
  description: The GetCaster method retrieves the Unit object that originally cast
    or triggered the AreaTrigger. This is typically used to determine the source of
    the area trigger effect, such as identifying which player or creature cast a spell
    that created the trigger. The returned Unit pointer can be used to access caster
    properties like position, health, faction, or other unit-specific data. In some
    cases, the caster may be null if the AreaTrigger was not created by a Unit (e.g.,
    environmental triggers).
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit that cast the AreaTrigger, or nullptr if no valid
    caster exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check caster type
    code: "if (Unit* caster = areaTrigger->GetCaster()) {\n    if (caster->IsPlayer())\
      \ {\n        // Handle player caster logic\n    } else if (caster->IsCreature())\
      \ {\n        // Handle creature caster logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing caster's position
    code: "Unit* caster = areaTrigger->GetCaster();\nif (caster) {\n    Position casterPos\
      \ = caster->GetPosition();\n    // Use caster position for further calculations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Unit pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the AreaTrigger
    and its caster. If the caster is destroyed or removed from the world, the pointer
    may become invalid. Always check for null before using the returned pointer.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned Unit is always a valid object. It can
    be nullptr if the AreaTrigger was created without a proper caster, such as in
    certain environmental or scripted scenarios.
