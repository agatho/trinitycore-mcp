  signature: bool Player::SatisfyQuestClass(const Quest * qInfo, bool msg) const
documentation:
  brief: Satisfies a quest class for the player, returning true if quest requirements
    are met.
  description: This method checks whether the player meets all requirements for a
    specific quest class. It evaluates the quest's requirements against the player's
    current state, including level, race, class, and other relevant factors. The method
    returns true if all requirements are satisfied, false otherwise. When msg is set
    to true, it sends messages to the player about quest completion or failure. This
    method is crucial for determining quest eligibility and handling quest progression
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object containing quest information to evaluate
      against player's requirements
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send messages to player about
      quest completion or failure
  returns: Returns true if all quest requirements are met for the player, false otherwise.
    The method may return false due to missing requirements, level mismatch, or other
    restrictions.
  examples:

    code: bool result = player->SatisfyQuestClass(quest, true);

  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (player->SatisfyQuestClass(quest, false)) {\n    // Quest requirements\
      \ met\n    // Proceed with quest completion\n} else {\n    // Quest requirements\
      \ not met\n    // Handle accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest system and should be used in conjunction
    with other quest-related methods. The method may involve complex checks for quest
    requirements including level, race, class, and other factors. It's important to
    note that this method does not actually complete the quest but only evaluates
    whether requirements are met.
  warnings: This method should not be used to directly complete quests. It is meant
    to evaluate whether a player meets requirements for a quest. Using it incorrectly
    can lead to quest progression issues or incorrect quest completion.
