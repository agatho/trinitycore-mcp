documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of bot accounts managed by the BotAccountMgr instance.
  description: The GetTotalBotAccounts method retrieves the total number of bot accounts
    currently tracked by the BotAccountMgr. This method provides a simple way to determine
    how many automated player characters are being managed within the system. The
    value returned represents the cumulative count of all bot accounts, including
    those that may be inactive or in various states of operation. This functionality
    is typically used for administrative purposes, monitoring, or to enforce limits
    on the number of bots allowed in the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total count of bot accounts managed by
    this BotAccountMgr instance. Returns zero if no bot accounts are currently registered.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 totalBots = sBotAccountMgr->GetTotalBotAccounts();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, "Total bot accounts: %u", totalBots);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Bot Account Limits
    code: "uint32 currentCount = sBotAccountMgr->GetTotalBotAccounts();\nif (currentCount\
      \ >= MAX_BOT_ACCOUNTS)\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_BOTS, \"Maximum bot account\
      \ limit reached!\");\n    // Handle overflow logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically implemented as a read-only operation that does not
    modify any internal state. It may involve iterating through an internal collection
    or maintaining a cached count for performance reasons. The returned value reflects
    the current state and may change if bot accounts are added or removed.
