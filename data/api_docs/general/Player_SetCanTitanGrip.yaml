  notes: This method directly affects the player's ability to use Titan's Grip, which
    is a key mechanic in World of Warcraft. It should be used carefully as it impacts
    gameplay balance and player experience. The penalty spell ID parameter is typically
    used for game mechanics adjustments or testing.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can affect player gameplay balance and may
    result in unexpected behavior during combat. Care should be taken when applying
    penalty spells to avoid unintended consequences.
