  class: BotSession
  method: IsLoginComplete
  signature: bool BotSession::IsLoginComplete() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session has completed the login process and is ready
    for gameplay.
  description: The IsLoginComplete method determines if a bot session has successfully
    finished the login sequence and is fully initialized within the game world. This
    includes verifying that the bot's character data has been loaded, authentication
    is complete, and all necessary subsystems are operational. The method typically
    returns true once the session reaches a stable state where commands can be safely
    executed. It serves as a synchronization point for bot operations, ensuring that
    actions are not attempted before the session is properly established.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session has completed login and is ready for gameplay;
    otherwise returns false if the login process is still in progress or has failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check login status
    code: "if (botSession->IsLoginComplete()) {\n    // Proceed with bot commands\n\
      \    botSession->SendChatMessage(\"Hello, World!\");\n} else {\n    // Wait\
      \ or handle incomplete login\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot login not complete yet.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a loop to wait for login completion
    code: "while (!botSession->IsLoginComplete()) {\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      \    // Optionally log progress\n}\nsLog->outString(\"Bot is now fully logged\
      \ in and ready.\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called from any thread, but it's recommended to check
    the login status on the main game thread for consistency. The implementation likely
    involves checking internal flags or state variables that are set during the login
    sequence completion.
  warnings: Calling bot commands before IsLoginComplete() returns true may result
    in undefined behavior or failed operations. This method should not be used as
    a blocking mechanism without proper timeout handling to prevent deadlocks.
