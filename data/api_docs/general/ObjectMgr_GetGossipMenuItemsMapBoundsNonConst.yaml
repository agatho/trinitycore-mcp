  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetGossipMenuItemsMapBoundsNonConst
  signature: int ObjectMgr::GetGossipMenuItemsMapBoundsNonConst(uint32 uiMenuId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of gossip menu items associated with a specified menu
    ID from the non-const map container.
  description: This method accesses the internal non-constant map structure that stores
    gossip menu items in the ObjectMgr class. It returns the count of entries for
    a given menu ID, which represents how many options or actions are available within
    that specific gossip menu. This is typically used during runtime to determine
    the size of dynamic gossip menus, particularly when iterating through or validating
    menu contents. The method assumes that the menu ID has already been validated
    and exists in the internal data structures. It's important to note that this method
    operates on a non-const map, implying it may modify or access mutable state within
    the ObjectMgr instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of gossip menu items associated with
    the specified menu ID. Returns zero if no items are found for the given menu ID,
    or if the menu ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Check Gossip Menu Item Count
    code: "uint32 menuId = 1001;\nint itemCount = sObjectMgr->GetGossipMenuItemsMapBoundsNonConst(menuId);\n\
      if (itemCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process the gossip menu items\n    printf(\"Menu\
      \ %u has %d items\\n\", menuId, itemCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No items\
      \ found for menu %u\\n\", menuId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is intended to be used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    and should not typically be called directly from custom modules unless working
    at a low-level data access level. Since it operates on a non-const map, concurrent
    access may require synchronization if multiple threads are involved.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid menu ID may result in undefined behavior
    or incorrect counts. Ensure that the menu ID is valid and exists in the gossip
    menu system before invoking this method to avoid potential issues.
