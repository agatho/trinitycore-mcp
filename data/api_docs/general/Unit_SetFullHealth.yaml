documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit's health to its maximum value
  description: The SetFullHealth method restores a unit's health to its full, maximum
    amount. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to reset a creature or
    player's health after damage or when preparing for combat. It ensures that the
    unit has full health points without any damage or depletion. The method typically
    affects both the current and maximum health values of the unit, making it useful
    for scenarios where health needs to be reset to its original state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetUnit();

      target->SetFullHealth();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other health-related functions
    such as SetHealth or SetMaxHealth. It should be noted that this method does not
    necessarily reset the unit's mana or other resource values, only health. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply sets health values without complex calculations.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with methods like SetHealth or SetMaxHealth,
    which may require specific values to be passed in. Using this method incorrectly
    can lead to unexpected behavior in combat situations where health is expected
    to be managed differently.
