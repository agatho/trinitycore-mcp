  class: QuestCompletion
  method: CanExecuteObjective
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::CanExecuteObjective(Player * bot, const QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player can execute a specific quest objective based
    on current game state and requirements.
  description: The CanExecuteObjective method evaluates if a given player bot is capable
    of completing a specified quest objective. It checks various conditions such as
    quest availability, player level, required items, quest flags, and other prerequisite
    states. This method is typically used in AI systems to decide which objectives
    to pursue or attempt next during quest completion. The evaluation considers both
    static quest data and dynamic player state to ensure logical progression through
    quests.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is being evaluated
      for objective execution capability.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing details about
      the specific quest objective to be checked.
  returns: Returns true if the bot can execute the given objective, false otherwise.
    The result depends on various checks including quest status, player level, inventory
    requirements, and other game conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest AI logic
    code: "if (questCompletion.CanExecuteObjective(bot, objective)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with executing the objective\n    bot->CompleteQuestObjective(objective);\n\
      } else {\n    // Skip or find alternative objectives\n    bot->FindNextAvailableObjective();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest progression system
    code: "bool canExecute = questCompletion.CanExecuteObjective(playerBot, currentQuestObjective);\n\
      if (canExecute && playerBot->HasRequiredItems(currentQuestObjective)) {\n  \
      \  // Execute the objective\n    questCompletion.ExecuteObjective(playerBot,\
      \ currentQuestObjective);\n} else if (!canExecute) {\n    // Log why it can't\
      \ be executed\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u cannot execute objective %u\", playerBot->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ currentQuestObjective.Id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest completion AI system and should be called
    before attempting to execute any quest objective. It's designed to prevent bots
    from attempting impossible or invalid actions, improving overall quest completion
    efficiency. The method may perform multiple internal checks including quest state
    validation, item availability, and player condition verification.
  warnings: This method assumes that the provided Player object is valid and properly
    initialized. Calling it with a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior.
    Additionally, the method does not modify any game state directly - it only evaluates
    conditions for execution.
