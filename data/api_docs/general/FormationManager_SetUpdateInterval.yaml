  class: FormationManager
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void FormationManager::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for the formation manager's periodic updates.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the FormationManager
    performs its periodic updates, measured in milliseconds. This interval controls
    the frequency at which formations are recalculated and applied to units within
    the manager's scope. The value must be a positive integer representing the time
    between updates. Setting this value too low may cause performance degradation
    due to excessive processing, while setting it too high may result in noticeable
    delays in formation adjustments. This method is typically used during initialization
    or configuration of formation behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Must be a positive integer value.
      Lower values increase update frequency and responsiveness but may impact performance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = new FormationManager();

      manager->SetUpdateInterval(1000); // Update every second'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = sObjectMgr->GetFormationManager();

      manager->SetUpdateInterval(50); // High frequency for responsive formations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the internal timer used by the FormationManager.
    The actual update timing may be subject to the game's main loop timing and frame
    rate. Changes take effect immediately without requiring a restart or reinitialization
    of the manager.
  warnings: Setting very low interval values (e.g., below 10ms) can cause significant
    performance issues and should be avoided in production environments. Ensure that
    the interval value is appropriate for your specific use case and target server
    performance requirements.
