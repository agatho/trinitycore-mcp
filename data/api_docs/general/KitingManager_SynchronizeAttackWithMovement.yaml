  signature: void KitingManager::SynchronizeAttackWithMovement()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes attack timing with player movement to optimize kiting behavior
    in combat.
  description: The SynchronizeAttackWithMovement method adjusts the timing of melee
    attacks to align with the player's movement patterns, ensuring that attacks are
    executed at optimal moments during kiting. This is crucial for maintaining damage
    output while avoiding enemy aggro or positional disadvantages. The method typically
    modifies attack speed or cooldowns based on movement state and distance to target.
    It may also adjust auto-attack timing to prevent clipping with movement animations
    or to ensure proper positioning during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n  \
      \  {\n        kitingManager.SynchronizeAttackWithMovement();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat updates and should be invoked
    regularly to maintain proper synchronization. It may interact with other AI systems
    such as threat management or positioning logic.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without checking combat state could lead to
    unexpected behavior or performance issues. Ensure that movement and attack states
    are properly synchronized before calling.
