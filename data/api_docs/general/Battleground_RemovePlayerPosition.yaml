  class: Battleground
  method: RemovePlayerPosition
  signature: void Battleground::RemovePlayerPosition(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player's position data from the battleground.
  description: The RemovePlayerPosition method removes stored positional information
    for a specific player within the battleground context. This method is typically
    invoked when a player leaves or is removed from a battleground, ensuring that
    stale position data does not persist in the system. The method operates on the
    player's unique identifier (GUID) to locate and eliminate their position records.
    It plays a crucial role in maintaining accurate battleground state management
    and preventing memory leaks from orphaned position data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose position data should
      be removed from the battleground.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing Player Position on Leave
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeave(Battleground* bg, uint64 guid)\n{\n    bg->RemovePlayerPosition(guid);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Removal During Battleground Cleanup
    code: "void CleanupBattleground(Battleground* bg, std::vector<uint64>& playerGuids)\n\
      {\n    for (uint64 guid : playerGuids)\n    {\n        bg->RemovePlayerPosition(guid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that track player
    positions during battleground events. It's important to ensure the GUID passed
    is valid and corresponds to an actual player currently in the battleground to
    avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the player exists in the battleground
    before calling this method.
