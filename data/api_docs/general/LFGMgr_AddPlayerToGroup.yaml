documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to a specific LFG group by their GUIDs
  description: The AddPlayerToGroup method is responsible for associating a player
    with a specific Looking For Group (LFG) dungeon group. This method takes two integer
    parameters representing the group GUID and the player GUID, respectively. It updates
    internal LFG data structures to reflect that the specified player has joined the
    given group. The method is typically invoked during LFG queue processing when
    players are matched into groups for dungeons or raids. This operation is crucial
    for maintaining synchronization between the player's LFG status and their actual
    group participation in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global unique identifier of the LFG group to which the player
      will be added
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player who will be added to the
      LFG group
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: LFGMgr::instance()->AddPlayerToGroup(12345, 67890);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with LFG Queue Processing
    code: "void HandleLFGMatch(int groupGuid, int playerGuid)\n{\n    // Validate\
      \ that both GUIDs are valid\n    if (groupGuid > 0 && playerGuid > 0)\n    {\n\
      \        LFGMgr::instance()->AddPlayerToGroup(groupGuid, playerGuid);\n    \
      \    // Additional logic for notifying player and updating UI\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system and should only be called
    after proper validation of group and player existence. It assumes that both the
    group and player are already registered in the LFG system. The implementation
    likely performs internal bookkeeping to track group membership, player status,
    and synchronization with the game's dungeon finder subsystem.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that both the group and player exist
    may result in undefined behavior or system instability. Ensure proper error handling
    and validation before invoking this function. This method does not perform any
    network communication or UI updates directly; it only modifies internal data structures.
