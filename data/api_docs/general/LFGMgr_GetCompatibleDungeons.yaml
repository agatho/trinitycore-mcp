  signature: void LFGMgr::GetCompatibleDungeons(LfgDungeonSet * dungeons, const int
    & players, LfgLockPartyMap * lockMap, int * playersMissingRequirement, bool isContinue)
documentation:
  brief: Fills a set of compatible LFG dungeons based on player count, lock map, and
    requirements.
  description: The GetCompatibleDungeons method populates a provided set of LFG (Looking
    For Group) dungeons with those that are compatible with the specified number of
    players, considering any existing lock mappings. It evaluates dungeon requirements
    such as player count, level ranges, and group composition to determine which dungeons
    can be joined by the given party. This method is used internally by the LFG system
    to filter valid dungeon options for players seeking group content. The method
    modifies the provided dungeons set in-place and may also update a counter for
    players missing specific requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeons
    description: Pointer to a set that will be filled with compatible LFG dungeon
      IDs. This set is modified in-place.
  - name: players
    description: The number of players in the group for which compatibility is being
      checked.
  - name: lockMap
    description: Pointer to a map containing lock information for party members. Used
      to determine if certain dungeons are locked due to previous selections or restrictions.
  - name: playersMissingRequirement
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be updated with the number of players
      who do not meet specific dungeon requirements (e.g., level, gear).
  - name: isContinue
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this is a continuation of a previous
      LFG search. Affects how certain restrictions are applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get compatible dungeons for a group of 5 players
    code: 'LfgDungeonSet dungeons;

      LfgLockPartyMap lockMap;

      int missingPlayers = 0;

      LFGMgr::instance()->GetCompatibleDungeons(&dungeons, 5, &lockMap, &missingPlayers,
      false);

      // Dungeons now contains all compatible LFG dungeons for a group of 5 players'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetCompatibleDungeons with lock map and checking missing requirements
    code: 'LfgDungeonSet dungeons;

      LfgLockPartyMap lockMap;

      lockMap[12345] = 100; // Player ID 12345 locked to dungeon 100

      int missingPlayers = 0;

      LFGMgr::instance()->GetCompatibleDungeons(&dungeons, 3, &lockMap, &missingPlayers,
      true);

      // Dungeons filtered based on group size and lock map, with missingPlayers updated'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal LFG system logic and should not be called
    directly by external modules unless implementing custom LFG behavior. The method
    assumes valid input parameters and modifies the provided containers in-place without
    returning them.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided dungeon set and lock map are properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid or uninitialized data can lead to undefined
    behavior. The playersMissingRequirement parameter is updated by reference and
    should be checked after the call to determine if any group members are excluded
    due to requirements.
