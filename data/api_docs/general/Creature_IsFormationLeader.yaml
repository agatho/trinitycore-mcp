  method: IsFormationLeader
  signature: bool Creature::IsFormationLeader() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is a formation leader.
  description: This method checks if the current creature instance is the leader of
    a formation, which is a group of creatures that are linked together through specific
    formation behaviors. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, formations
    are used to manage creature groups that move together as a unit, often with shared
    AI behavior or specific positioning rules. This method returns true when the creature
    serves as the leader for its formation, and false otherwise. The check is typically
    performed during AI execution or formation-related operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is the formation leader, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsFormationLeader()) {\n    // Do something specific to formation\
      \ leaders\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of creature AI and formation
    management. It's important to note that the method may return false even if a
    creature has formation-related behavior, as it specifically checks for leadership
    status rather than general formation membership.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a direct replacement for checking formation
    membership; it only indicates leadership status. The method may not work correctly
    in all scenarios involving multiple creatures or complex formation setups.
