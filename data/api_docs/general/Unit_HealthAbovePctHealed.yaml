  class: Unit
  method: HealthAbovePctHealed
  signature: bool Unit::HealthAbovePctHealed(int32 pct, uint32 heal) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if unit's health is above a specified percentage after being healed.
  description: This method determines whether a unit's current health percentage exceeds
    a given threshold after applying a heal amount. It is commonly used in AI scripts
    to evaluate if a unit has sufficient health to continue combat or perform specific
    actions. The method returns true when the unit's health percentage is above the
    specified value, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for implementing
    conditional logic in creature AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: pct
    description: The health percentage threshold to compare against. Valid values
      range from 0 to 100, representing a percentage of maximum health.
  - name: heal
    description: The heal amount applied to the unit's current health before checking
      the percentage. This value represents the healing effect that will be added
      to the unit's health.
  returns: Returns true if the unit's health percentage is above the specified threshold
    after applying the heal, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->HealthAbovePctHealed(30, 100)) {\n    // Do something when health\
      \ is above 30%\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "if (unit->HealthAbovePctHealed(50, 250)) {\n    // Check if health is above\
      \ 50% after healing 250 points\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI scripts to determine whether a unit has
    sufficient health to perform certain actions. It may be affected by the unit's
    maximum health value and can be influenced by various healing mechanics.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method as it depends on the unit's current
    health and heal amount. The method may not behave as expected if the heal amount
    is negative or if the unit's health is already above the threshold before healing.
