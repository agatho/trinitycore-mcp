  class: AnyGroupedUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  method: AnyGroupedUnitInObjectRangeCheck
  signature: void AnyGroupedUnitInObjectRangeCheck::AnyGroupedUnitInObjectRangeCheck(const
    int * obj, const int * funit, float range, bool raid, bool playerOnly, bool incOwnRadius,
    bool incTargetRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a check for any grouped unit within a specified range of an object.
  description: The AnyGroupedUnitInObjectRangeCheck constructor initializes a predicate
    that can be used to determine whether any unit belonging to the same group (such
    as a raid or party) exists within a given distance from a specified object. This
    functionality is commonly used in AI and targeting systems where group-based detection
    logic is required, particularly in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The check considers optional parameters such as raid membership, player-only filtering,
    and inclusion of radius offsets for more precise targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the object (such as a unit or game object) from which
      the range is measured.
  - name: funit
    description: Pointer to the unit being checked for group membership and proximity.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance within which units are considered to be in range.
  - name: raid
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include raid members (true) or
      only party members (false).
  - name: playerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to consider only player-controlled
      units (true) or all units (false).
  - name: incOwnRadius
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include the radius of the object
      when calculating range.
  - name: incTargetRadius
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to include the radius of the target
      unit when calculating range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group targeting logic
    code: "AnyGroupedUnitInObjectRangeCheck check(&player, &target, 30.0f, true, false,\
      \ true, true);\nif (check(player)) {\n    // Perform action if a grouped unit\
      \ is within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This class is typically used in conjunction with other predicate-based systems
    for AI decision-making. It's important to ensure that the pointers passed are
    valid and not null, as invalid references can lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using large ranges or player-only filters in performance-critical
    code paths, as these checks may iterate through many units. Also, incorrect handling
    of radius inclusion flags might cause unexpected targeting behavior.
