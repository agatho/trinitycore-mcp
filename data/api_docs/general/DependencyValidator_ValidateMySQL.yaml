  class: DependencyValidator
  method: ValidateMySQL
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::ValidateMySQL()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the MySQL database connection and dependencies for TrinityCore.
  description: The ValidateMySQL method checks whether the MySQL database connection
    is properly configured and accessible within the TrinityCore environment. It verifies
    that required database tables, schemas, and connection parameters are correctly
    set up to support core game functionality. This validation typically occurs during
    server startup or configuration loading phases to ensure all database dependencies
    are met before proceeding with normal operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the MySQL database connection and all required dependencies
    are successfully validated; otherwise returns false if any validation check fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Startup
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->ValidateMySQL()) {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"server\"\
      , \"MySQL dependency validation failed. Server cannot start.\");\n    exit(1);\n\
      }\nLOG_INFO(\"server\", \"MySQL dependencies validated successfully.\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization and may perform
    database queries to verify schema integrity. It's important to ensure that the
    MySQL configuration in the TrinityCore configuration files (such as config.lua
    or worldserver.conf) is correct before this method is invoked.
  warnings: If this method returns false, the server should not proceed with normal
    operation as it indicates critical database connectivity or schema issues. Failure
    to properly validate MySQL dependencies can lead to runtime errors or data corruption.
