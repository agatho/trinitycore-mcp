  brief: Adds a passenger to a mounted player's vehicle
  description: The AddPassenger method attempts to add a specified player as a passenger
    to a mounted player's vehicle. This method is typically used in the context of
    vehicle management within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
    It handles the logic for assigning a passenger to a vehicle and updating the necessary
    game state variables. The method requires both the mounted player and the passenger
    to be valid entities within the game world, and it performs checks to ensure that
    the passenger can legally occupy the vehicle seat.
  parameters:
  - name: mountedPlayer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the player who is
      currently mounted and acting as the vehicle
  - name: passenger
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the player who wishes
      to become a passenger on the mounted player's vehicle
  returns: Returns true if the passenger was successfully added to the vehicle, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if either player is invalid, not in a valid
    state, or if the passenger cannot be seated due to vehicle restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddPassenger
    code: "int mountedGuid = 12345;\nint passengerGuid = 67890;\nbool result = mountManager.AddPassenger(&mountedGuid,\
      \ &passengerGuid);\nif (result) {\n    // Passenger successfully added\n   \
      \ printf(\"Passenger added to vehicle\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to add\
      \ passenger\n    printf(\"Failed to add passenger\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal vehicle systems and may trigger
    game events or updates related to vehicle state changes. It assumes that both
    players are valid and within the same game session context.
  warnings: Ensure that both player GUIDs point to valid, active players in the game
    world. Attempting to add a passenger to an invalid or non-existent mounted player
    will likely result in undefined behavior or failure.
