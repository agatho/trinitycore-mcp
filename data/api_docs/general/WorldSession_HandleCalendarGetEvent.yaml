documentation:
  brief: Retrieves calendar event data from the server for a specified event ID.
  description: The HandleCalendarGetEvent method processes incoming client requests
    to fetch detailed information about a specific calendar event. It is part of the
    WorldSession's calendar handling system and responds to client requests by retrieving
    event details such as title, description, date, time, invitees, and other metadata
    from the server's calendar database. This method typically handles authentication
    checks to ensure the requesting player has permission to view the event, and may
    also validate that the event exists before sending back the data. The method operates
    within the context of World of Warcraft's calendar system where players can organize
    and manage events like raids, guild activities, or social gatherings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleCalendarGetEvent(WorldPackets::Calendar::CalendarGetEvent\
      \ & calendarGetEvent)\n{\n    // Validate event ID\n    if (calendarGetEvent.EventID\
      \ == 0)\n        return;\n    \n    // Fetch and send event details\n    CalendarEvent\
      \ const* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(calendarGetEvent.EventID);\n    if (!event)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    WorldPackets::Calendar::CalendarEventInfo packet;\n\
      \    // Populate packet with event data\n    SendPacket(packet.Write());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's calendar system implementation and
    relies on proper session authentication to ensure only authorized players can
    access event information. The method assumes that the client has already validated
    the event ID format and that the server-side calendar manager is properly initialized.
  warnings: Improper handling of event IDs may lead to crashes or data corruption.
    Always validate that the event exists before attempting to retrieve its details.
    This method should not be called directly without proper session context as it
    relies on session-specific authentication checks.
