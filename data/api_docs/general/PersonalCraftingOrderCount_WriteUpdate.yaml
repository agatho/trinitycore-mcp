  class: PersonalCraftingOrderCount
  method: WriteUpdate
  signature: void PersonalCraftingOrderCount::WriteUpdate(ByteBuffer & data, bool
    ignoreChangesMask, const Player * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes personal crafting order count data into a ByteBuffer for network
    transmission to a player.
  description: The WriteUpdate method serializes the current state of a PersonalCraftingOrderCount
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to either the
    owner or receiver player. This method is typically invoked when sending updates
    about crafting orders to clients in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The serialization process respects change masks and can optionally ignore them
    based on the ignoreChangesMask parameter. It ensures that only relevant data is
    sent, optimizing bandwidth usage. The method requires both owner and receiver
    players to be provided for proper context during serialization.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where serialized crafting order count data
      will be written. This buffer is used for network packet construction.
  - name: ignoreChangesMask
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to ignore the change tracking mask
      during serialization. When true, all fields are serialized regardless of their
      changed status.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the crafting
      orders. Used for context and validation during serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized data.
      Determines the target audience for the update packet.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Crafting System Update
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      PersonalCraftingOrderCount orderCount;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      orderCount.WriteUpdate(data, false, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Force Update with Ignore Mask
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      PersonalCraftingOrderCount orderCount;

      Player* owner = ...;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      orderCount.WriteUpdate(data, true, owner, receiver);

      // Send full update regardless of changes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the World of Warcraft TrinityCore framework's object
    update system. It should only be called when crafting order data has changed or
    needs to be synchronized with clients. The method assumes that both owner and
    receiver players are valid and properly initialized. Performance-wise, this method
    avoids unnecessary serialization by checking change masks unless explicitly overridden.
  warnings: Calling this method without valid player pointers can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that both owner and receiver parameters are non-null
    before invoking the method. The ignoreChangesMask parameter should be used sparingly
    as it may cause unnecessary network traffic.
