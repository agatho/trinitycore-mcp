  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: ExecuteEOTSStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::ExecuteEOTSStrategy(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the end-of-the-season strategy for battleground AI, handling player-related
    logic and state transitions.
  description: The ExecuteEOTSStrategy method is responsible for managing the end-of-the-season
    behavior within a battleground's AI system. This function typically handles cleanup
    operations, player state updates, reward distribution, or any season-specific
    logic that should be executed when a battleground session concludes. It may also
    manage transitions between different game states or prepare the battleground for
    the next season cycle. The method operates on a provided integer pointer to a
    player identifier, which is likely used to determine which player's data needs
    to be processed during this end-of-season transition.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier for whom
      the end-of-season strategy should be executed. This value is typically used
      to locate and process specific player data within the battleground AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      BattlegroundAI bgAI;

      bgAI.ExecuteEOTSStrategy(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger battleground AI framework and may
    be invoked automatically during battleground cleanup or season transition events.
    The player pointer should be validated before use to avoid null dereference issues.
  warnings: Ensure that the player identifier passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an active player in the battleground, otherwise undefined behavior may occur.
