    hidden)
documentation:
  brief: Updates a battleground's world state value for all players in the arena.
  description: The UpdateWorldState method is used to update a specific world state
    variable within a battleground. This method sends the updated value to all players
    currently participating in the battleground, allowing for real-time display of
    game information such as scores, timers, or resource counts. The hidden parameter
    determines whether the world state is visible to players (false) or hidden from
    view (true). This functionality is essential for dynamic UI updates during battleground
    events and matches.
  parameters:
  - name: worldStateId
    description: The unique identifier of the world state variable to update. Each
      battleground has its own set of predefined world state IDs that correspond to
      specific game elements like score counters, timers, or resource levels.
  - name: value
    description: The new integer value to assign to the specified world state ID.
      This value is typically a numeric representation of game data such as points,
      time remaining, or quantities of resources.
  - name: hidden
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the world state should be hidden
      from players (true) or displayed visibly (false). When true, the value is sent
      to clients but not shown in the UI, useful for internal tracking without visual
      clutter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Score Display
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->UpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_TEAM_1_SCORE, 10, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Hide Timer Value
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->UpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_TIMER, 60, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from battleground event handlers or periodic
    update loops. It's important to note that world state updates are sent over the
    network and should be used sparingly to avoid excessive bandwidth usage. The method
    operates on a per-battleground basis, so it must be called on an active battleground
    instance.
  warnings: Incorrect worldStateId values may result in undefined behavior or UI glitches.
    Always ensure that the world state ID corresponds to a valid variable defined
    for the specific battleground type. Avoid calling this method too frequently during
    high-frequency updates as it could impact performance.
