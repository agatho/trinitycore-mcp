  method: UpdateMaxPower
  signature: void Player::UpdateMaxPower(int power)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum power value for the player based on the specified power
    type.
  description: The UpdateMaxPower method adjusts the maximum power value for a player
    character, typically used when changing power types such as mana, rage, or energy.
    This method is commonly invoked during class changes, level-ups, or when applying
    buffs/debuffs that modify power capacity. The method internally recalculates and
    updates the player's power statistics to reflect the new maximum value. It ensures
    that the player's power bar displays correctly and that all power-based mechanics
    function properly with the updated maximum values.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The power type identifier (e.g., POWER_MANA, POWER_RAGE, POWER_ENERGY)
      for which to update the maximum value. This parameter determines which power
      statistic is modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update maximum mana for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateMaxPower(POWER_MANA);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update all power types after class change
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_POWERS; ++i)\n{\n    player->UpdateMaxPower(i);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically triggers internal recalculations of power statistics
    and may send updates to the client. It should be called after modifying any power-related
    attributes such as level, class, or buffs that affect maximum power values. The
    method does not directly modify the current power value, only the maximum allowed
    value.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may cause visual inconsistencies
    in the player's UI. Ensure that all related power modifications are properly synchronized
    with the client to prevent display issues. Avoid calling this method excessively
    during combat as it might trigger unnecessary network updates.
