documentation:
  brief: Stops real-time monitoring of AI decision-making processes within the AIDecisionProfiler.
  description: The StopRealTimeMonitoring method halts the ongoing collection and
    analysis of AI decision data that was previously initiated through a corresponding
    StartRealTimeMonitoring call. This method is typically used to cease performance
    profiling or debugging of AI behaviors in real-time, allowing developers or administrators
    to finalize measurements or switch to different monitoring modes. It ensures that
    no further AI decision events are recorded or processed by the profiler instance.
    The method does not require any parameters and has no return value. It is generally
    expected to be called after a monitoring session has been started to properly
    conclude the profiling activity.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.StartRealTimeMonitoring();

      // ... AI behavior execution and monitoring ...

      profiler.StopRealTimeMonitoring();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a matching StartRealTimeMonitoring()
    has been invoked. Calling StopRealTimeMonitoring without prior initialization
    may lead to undefined behavior or errors depending on the internal state management
    of the profiler. The profiler's internal state is reset upon stopping, which may
    affect subsequent profiling sessions.
  warnings: Calling this method without having started real-time monitoring first
    might result in inconsistent internal state or unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    all monitoring sessions are properly managed to avoid resource leaks or data corruption.
