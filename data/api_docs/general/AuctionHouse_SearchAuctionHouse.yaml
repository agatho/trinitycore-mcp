documentation:
  brief: Initiates a search query on the auction house system for items matching specified
    criteria.
  description: The SearchAuctionHouse method processes a given auction search query
    and retrieves matching auction items for the specified player. This function is
    typically invoked when a player interacts with the auction house interface to
    filter or browse available items. The method handles various search parameters
    including item type, quality, level range, and other filters defined in the AuctionSearchQuery
    structure. It updates internal state or sends relevant data packets to the client
    to display results.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Used to associate the search results with the correct player session.
  - name: query
    description: Reference to an AuctionSearchQuery object containing filter criteria
      such as item class, subclass, quality, level range, and other searchable attributes.

    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionSearchQuery query;

      query.itemClass = ITEM_CLASS_WEAPON;

      query.minLevel = 10;

      query.maxLevel = 50;

      AuctionHouse::SearchAuctionHouse(&playerId, query);'

  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to retrieve auction listings
    based on the provided query. It may also trigger UI updates or packet sends to
    the client for displaying results.
  warnings: Ensure that the player ID is valid and the query parameters are within
    acceptable ranges to prevent invalid data access or crashes.
