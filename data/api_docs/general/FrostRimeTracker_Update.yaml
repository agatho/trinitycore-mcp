  class: FrostRimeTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void FrostRimeTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the FrostRimeTracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the FrostRimeTracker for a given player bot. This typically involves
    checking the current status of frost-related effects, updating cooldowns, managing
    resource usage, or adjusting behavior based on the player's current condition.
    The method likely integrates with TrinityCore's AI and spell systems to ensure
    proper tracking and response to frost mechanics during gameplay. It is commonly
    called during AI update cycles or when specific frost-related events occur.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose FrostRimeTracker
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_bot)\n        m_frostRimeTracker->Update(m_bot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Tracker After Spell Cast
    code: "void FrostRimeTracker::OnSpellCast(Player* bot, SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n\
      {\n    if (spellInfo->Id == 20570) // Ice Lance\n        Update(bot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the AI update loop or in response to
    specific game events. It may perform operations that affect spell cooldowns, resource
    management, or bot behavior decisions based on frost mechanics. Ensure that the
    Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will result in undefined behavior.
    This method should only be called when the player object is fully initialized
    and active within the game world.
