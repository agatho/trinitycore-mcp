  class: MistweaverSoothingMistTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void MistweaverSoothingMistTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the soothing mist tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in MistweaverSoothingMistTracker is responsible for
    refreshing and maintaining the internal state of the soothing mist ability tracking
    system for a given player bot. This method typically evaluates the current status
    of the soothing mist effect, checks for any changes in the player's aura state,
    updates cooldown information, and ensures that the tracker accurately reflects
    the current game state. It is commonly invoked during AI decision-making cycles
    or when specific events related to the mist ability occur, such as casting, refreshing,
    or losing the effect. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    member variables of the tracker object based on the player's current condition
    and abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose soothing
      mist state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_soothingMistTracker)\n        m_soothingMistTracker->Update(m_bot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Ability Cooldown Checks
    code: "void MistweaverSoothingMistTracker::Update(Player* bot)\n{\n    if (!bot\
      \ || !bot->HasAura(SOOTHING_MIST_AURA_ID))\n        return;\n\n    // Update\
      \ cooldown and effect duration\n    m_lastCastTime = getMSTime();\n    m_remainingDuration\
      \ = bot->GetAura(SOOTHING_MIST_AURA_ID)->GetDuration();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid Player objects that are actively
    using the Mistweaver specialization. The internal state of the tracker may depend
    on specific aura IDs and spell mechanics unique to the Mistweaver class. It is
    recommended to call this method regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    accurate tracking.
  warnings: Calling Update with a null or invalid player pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid,
    active player object before invoking this method.
