  method: GetScenario
  signature: Scenario * WorldObject::GetScenario() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Scenario object associated with this WorldObject, or nullptr
    if the object is not part of a scenario.
  description: The GetScenario method retrieves the Scenario instance that the current
    WorldObject belongs to. This is commonly used in scenarios such as world events,
    dungeons, or achievements where objects need to be tracked within a specific scenario
    context. The method returns a pointer to the Scenario object if the WorldObject
    is currently participating in a scenario, or nullptr if it is not associated with
    any active scenario. This allows developers to query and interact with scenario-specific
    data or logic tied to the object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Scenario object if the WorldObject is part of a scenario;
    otherwise, returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an object belongs to a scenario
    code: "Scenario* scenario = player->GetScenario();\nif (scenario != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Object is part of a scenario\n    sLog->outString(\"Player is in scenario:\
      \ %u\", scenario->GetID());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Object is not in any scenario\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Player is not in any scenario.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing scenario data for custom event handling
    code: "WorldObject* object = ...; // some WorldObject\nScenario* scenario = object->GetScenario();\n\
      if (scenario && scenario->IsScenarioActive())\n{\n    // Perform scenario-specific\
      \ logic\n    scenario->UpdateObjective(object, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with scenario-based systems
    such as world events or dungeon scenarios. It's important to check for nullptr
    before dereferencing the returned pointer to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Always verify that the returned Scenario pointer is not null before using
    it, as many WorldObjects may not be part of a scenario at any given time.
