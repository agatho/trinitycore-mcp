  class: InventoryManager
  method: SetAutoEquipEnabled
  signature: void InventoryManager::SetAutoEquipEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic equipping of items in the player's inventory.
  description: The SetAutoEquipEnabled method controls whether the game automatically
    equips newly acquired items into the appropriate inventory slots for the player.
    When enabled, items such as weapons, armor, and accessories are automatically
    moved to their correct equipment positions upon acquisition or when added to the
    inventory. This behavior is commonly used during character creation, item looting,
    or when using certain in-game actions that result in new gear being added to the
    inventory. The method does not validate the item type or slot compatibility; it
    simply toggles this automatic behavior on or off for the player's inventory management
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value that determines whether auto-equip functionality
      is active. When true, items will be automatically equipped in appropriate slots.
      When false, new items will remain in the inventory without automatic equipping.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Equip for Player
    code: 'InventoryManager* invMgr = player->GetInventory();

      invMgr->SetAutoEquipEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Equip During Inventory Management
    code: 'InventoryManager* invMgr = player->GetInventory();

      invMgr->SetAutoEquipEnabled(false);

      // Perform manual item placement

      invMgr->SetAutoEquipEnabled(true); // Re-enable after manual operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects only the automatic equipping behavior and does not modify
    existing equipment or inventory contents. It is typically used in conjunction
    with other inventory management functions to control how items are handled during
    gameplay. The setting persists across sessions unless explicitly changed.
  warnings: Disabling auto-equip may cause items to remain in the inventory without
    being properly equipped, potentially leading to suboptimal character performance.
    Use this method carefully when performing bulk item operations or custom inventory
    logic.
