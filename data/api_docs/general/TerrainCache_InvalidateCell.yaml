  class: TerrainCache
  method: InvalidateCell
  signature: void TerrainCache::InvalidateCell(uint32 x, uint32 y)
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates the specified cell in the terrain cache, removing cached data
    for that cell.
  description: The InvalidateCell method removes all cached terrain data for a specific
    cell identified by its x and y coordinates. This is typically used when terrain
    modifications occur in the game world, ensuring that subsequent requests for that
    cell's data will fetch fresh information from the source rather than using stale
    cached values. The method operates on a per-cell basis and does not affect other
    cells in the cache. This functionality is essential for maintaining data consistency
    in dynamic environments where terrain features may change during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The x-coordinate of the cell to invalidate. Represents the horizontal
      position in the terrain grid system.
  - name: y
    description: The y-coordinate of the cell to invalidate. Represents the vertical
      position in the terrain grid system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cell Invalidation
    code: 'TerrainCache* cache = TerrainCache::Instance();

      cache->InvalidateCell(10, 15);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Invalidating Multiple Cells
    code: "TerrainCache* cache = TerrainCache::Instance();\nfor (int x = 0; x < 5;\
      \ ++x)\n{\n    for (int y = 0; y < 5; ++y)\n    {\n        cache->InvalidateCell(x,\
      \ y);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. It's
    recommended to call this method when terrain modifications occur to prevent rendering
    artifacts or incorrect collision detection based on stale cached data.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid coordinates may result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that x and y values are within valid bounds for the current map's grid
    system before invoking this method.
