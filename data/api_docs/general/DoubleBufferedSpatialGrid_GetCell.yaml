  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetCell
  signature: const CellContents & DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetCell(uint32 x, uint32
    y) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the contents of a specified cell within the spatial grid.
  description: The GetCell method retrieves the CellContents object associated with
    the given grid coordinates (x, y). This method is used to access the data stored
    in a particular cell of the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid, which is typically employed
    for efficient spatial partitioning and object management in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore. The returned reference provides direct access to the cell's contents,
    allowing for fast retrieval of entities or objects located within that specific
    grid cell. This method assumes valid coordinates are provided and does not perform
    bounds checking.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The x-coordinate of the grid cell to retrieve. Must be a valid grid
      index within the spatial grid boundaries.
  - name: y
    description: The y-coordinate of the grid cell to retrieve. Must be a valid grid
      index within the spatial grid boundaries.
  returns: A constant reference to the CellContents object representing the contents
    of the specified grid cell. The returned object may be empty if no entities are
    present in that cell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const CellContents& cell = grid.GetCell(5, 10);\n// Access objects within\
      \ the cell\nfor (auto const& obj : cell)\n{\n    // Process each object in the\
      \ cell\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Object Presence
    code: "uint32 cellX = 15;\nuint32 cellY = 20;\nconst CellContents& cell = grid.GetCell(cellX,\
      \ cellY);\nif (!cell.empty())\n{\n    // Cell contains objects\n    // Perform\
      \ operations on the contents\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a double-buffered spatial grid implementation, which
    may involve synchronization considerations when used in multi-threaded environments.
    The returned reference is valid only as long as the grid and its contents remain
    unmodified. Performance is optimized for frequent lookups but assumes that coordinates
    are within valid ranges.
  warnings: Ensure that x and y coordinates are within the valid range of the spatial
    grid to avoid undefined behavior or memory access violations. Do not modify the
    returned CellContents reference directly unless you understand the implications
    of modifying shared data structures.
