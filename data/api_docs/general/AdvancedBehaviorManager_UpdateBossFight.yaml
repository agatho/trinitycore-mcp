documentation:
  brief: Updates the state and behavior of active boss fights in the game world
  description: The UpdateBossFight method is responsible for managing the progression
    and logic of ongoing boss encounters within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    typically handles AI decision-making, health tracking, phase transitions, and
    interaction with player actions during boss battles. It is called regularly by
    the core game loop to ensure that boss fights evolve properly according to their
    defined behavior patterns. The method processes time-based events, checks for
    victory/defeat conditions, and updates the overall encounter state as needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateBossFight(diff);\n\
      \    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat System
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_bossFightActive)\n   \
      \ {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->UpdateBossFight(diff);\n        // Additional\
      \ AI logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently during boss encounters to maintain
    proper game state. It's designed to be lightweight and efficient, typically processing
    only active boss fights rather than iterating through all possible encounters.
    The method may internally manage multiple boss instances concurrently.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the main game update loop context as
    it may cause race conditions or inconsistent behavior. Ensure that boss fight
    states are properly initialized before calling this method.
