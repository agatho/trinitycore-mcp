  class: InterruptUtils
  method: GetEmergencyInterruptSpells
  signature: int InterruptUtils::GetEmergencyInterruptSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of emergency interrupt spells available for use.
  description: The GetEmergencyInterruptSpells method returns an integer value representing
    the number of emergency interrupt spells currently configured or available for
    use within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically used in combat-related
    systems where immediate spell interruption is required, such as during player
    versus player encounters or scripted boss fights. The return value indicates how
    many interrupt abilities are ready to be executed without delay, which may affect
    gameplay decisions and AI behavior. The method does not require any parameters
    and operates on internal spell data structures maintained by the core engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the count of emergency interrupt spells that
    can be immediately used. A return value of zero means no emergency interrupts
    are available, while positive values represent the number of usable emergency
    interrupt abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int interruptCount = InterruptUtils::GetEmergencyInterruptSpells();\nif\
      \ (interruptCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with interrupt logic\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"\
      world\", \"Available emergency interrupts: {}\", interruptCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal spell databases or caches maintained
    by TrinityCore's spell system. It may be called frequently during combat processing,
    so performance considerations should be taken into account when using this in
    tight loops. The actual implementation details depend on how emergency interrupts
    are defined and managed within the core spell framework.
  warnings: Ensure that any logic relying on this method's return value properly handles
    zero or negative values, as these may indicate an invalid state or missing configuration.
    This method should not be used outside of appropriate combat contexts where interrupt
    mechanics apply.
