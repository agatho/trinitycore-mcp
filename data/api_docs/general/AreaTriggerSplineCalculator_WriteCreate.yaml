  class: AreaTriggerSplineCalculator
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerSplineCalculator::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const
    AreaTrigger * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes area trigger create data to a byte buffer for transmission to a player.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of an AreaTrigger
    object into a ByteBuffer format suitable for sending to a specific Player client.
    This method is typically used during packet construction for area trigger creation
    messages, ensuring that the client receives all necessary information about the
    area trigger's position, spline path, duration, and other relevant attributes.
    The serialized data includes the owner's GUID, trigger type, duration, and spline
    information needed by the client to render and manage the area trigger effect.
    This method is part of the network synchronization system that keeps client-side
    area triggers in sync with server-side state.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized area trigger create
      data will be written. This buffer is typically used to construct network packets
      sent to the player.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that contains the data to be serialized.
      This represents the actual area trigger being created in the world.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this area trigger create
      packet. Used for determining visibility and client-specific serialization details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet construction
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      AreaTriggerSplineCalculator calculator;

      AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // some area trigger

      Player* player = ...; // target player


      calculator.WriteCreate(data, trigger, player);

      // Send data as part of a packet to the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with area trigger spawn system
    code: "void SendAreaTriggerCreatePacket(Player* player, AreaTrigger* trigger)\
      \ {\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    AreaTriggerSplineCalculator calculator;\n   \
      \ \n    // Write create packet for the area trigger\n    calculator.WriteCreate(data,\
      \ trigger, player);\n    \n    // Send to player\n    player->GetSession()->SendPacket(&data);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's network packet serialization system
    for area triggers. It assumes that the AreaTrigger object has been properly initialized
    with all necessary data before calling. The method does not perform any validation
    on the input parameters, so callers should ensure that owner and receiver are
    valid pointers.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null owner pointer will likely result in a
    crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that both owner and receiver parameters are
    valid before invoking this method. The ByteBuffer must be properly sized or will
    be automatically resized as needed during serialization.
