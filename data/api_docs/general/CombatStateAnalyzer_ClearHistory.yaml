    by removing all previously recorded combat events and historical data. This method
    is typically used to reset the analyzer's memory before starting a new combat
    analysis session or when transitioning between different combat scenarios. The
    operation is immediate and does not require any external dependencies or resources.
    After calling this method, the analyzer will have no prior combat state information
    available for processing or evaluation.

    does not involve any dynamic memory allocation or deallocation. It is designed
    to be efficient and thread-safe for use in high-frequency combat analysis scenarios.
