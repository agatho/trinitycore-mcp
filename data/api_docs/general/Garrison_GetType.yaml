api:
  class: Garrison
  method: GetType
  signature: GarrisonType Garrison::GetType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the garrison.
  description: The GetType method returns the GarrisonType enumeration value that
    represents the specific type of garrison associated with this object. This enumeration
    typically defines different garrison types such as player garrisons, faction-specific
    garrisons, or specialized garrison variants used in various game mechanics like
    world events or achievements. The returned value is essential for determining
    how to interact with or process the garrison within the game's systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GarrisonType enumeration value indicating the specific type of garrison.
    Possible values may include types such as GARRISON_TYPE_NORMAL, GARRISON_TYPE_FACTION,
    or other specialized garrison variants depending on the game version and implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Garrison Type
    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nGarrisonType type = garrison->GetType();\n\
      if (type == GARRISON_TYPE_NORMAL)\n{\n    // Handle normal player garrison logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other garrison-related
    APIs to determine appropriate behavior based on the garrison type. It's a read-only
    operation and should not modify any internal state.
