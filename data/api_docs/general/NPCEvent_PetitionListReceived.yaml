  class: NPCEvent
  method: PetitionListReceived
  signature: NPCEvent NPCEvent::PetitionListReceived(int playerGuid, int npcGuid,
    uint32 petitionEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns an NPCEvent object indicating that a player has received
    a petition list from an NPC.
  description: The PetitionListReceived method is used to generate an NPCEvent that
    represents the event when a player receives a list of available petitions from
    an NPC, typically a guild charter or arena team petition. This method constructs
    and returns a new NPCEvent instance with the specified player GUID, NPC GUID,
    and petition entry ID. The event is commonly triggered during interactions with
    petition NPCs such as those found in major cities where players can create guilds
    or join arena teams. The returned event object can be used by the game's event
    system to process the petition list delivery and update the player's UI accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who received the petition
      list. This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the player's database
      entry.
  - name: npcGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC from which the petition list
      was received. This represents the specific petition vendor or interaction point.
  - name: petitionEntry
    description: The entry ID of the petition type being offered. This identifies
      what kind of petition is available, such as guild charter (1), arena team (2),
      etc.
  returns: Returns a new NPCEvent object representing the successful receipt of a
    petition list by a player from an NPC. The returned event contains all relevant
    data about the interaction for further processing by the game's event handling
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'NPCEvent event = NPCEvent::PetitionListReceived(12345, 67890, 1);

      // This creates an event indicating player 12345 received a guild charter petition
      from NPC 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing petition list event in game logic
    code: "void HandlePetitionListReceived(int playerGuid, int npcGuid, uint32 petitionEntry)\n\
      {\n    NPCEvent event = NPCEvent::PetitionListReceived(playerGuid, npcGuid,\
      \ petitionEntry);\n    // Process the event to update UI or trigger further\
      \ actions\n    if (event.IsValid())\n    {\n        // Update player's petition\
      \ list display\n        SendPetitionListToPlayer(playerGuid, petitionEntry);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    processing player-NPC interactions related to petitions. The returned NPCEvent
    object should be handled immediately or queued for later processing by the game's
    event system. The petitionEntry parameter should correspond to valid entries in
    the petition database table.
  warnings: Ensure that all GUIDs passed are valid and exist in the database before
    calling this method, as invalid GUIDs may cause undefined behavior. This method
    does not perform validation on the petitionEntry value - it is assumed to be a
    valid entry from the petition system.
