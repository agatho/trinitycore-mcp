  class: LFGDungeonsEntry
  method: Entry
  signature: uint32 LFGDungeonsEntry::Entry() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the LFG dungeon entry.
  description: The Entry method retrieves the unique identifier associated with a
    specific LFG (Looking for Group) dungeon entry. This identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore to distinguish between different dungeon instances, such as various
    raid dungeons or scenario types. The returned value typically corresponds to the
    ID field in the lfg_dungeons database table and is essential for matching players
    with appropriate dungeon groups during LFG queue processing. This method is commonly
    used when checking dungeon eligibility, retrieving dungeon properties, or managing
    group formations for dungeon content.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the LFG dungeon entry.
    This ID directly maps to entries in the lfg_dungeons database table and serves
    as a key for identifying specific dungeon instances within the game's LFG system.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Dungeon Entry ID
    code: 'LFGDungeonsEntry const* dungeon = sLFGMgr->GetLFGDungeon(1234);

      uint32 entryId = dungeon->Entry();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Dungeon entry ID: %u", entryId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Dungeon Eligibility
    code: "LFGDungeonsEntry const* dungeon = sLFGMgr->GetLFGDungeon(player->GetGroup()->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      if (dungeon && dungeon->Entry() == 1234)\n{\n    // Player is eligible for this\
      \ specific dungeon\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns cached data from the LFGDungeonsEntry
    object. It does not perform any database lookups or computations, making it efficient
    to call. The returned value should be treated as read-only and represents a stable
    identifier for the dungeon entry throughout the game session.
