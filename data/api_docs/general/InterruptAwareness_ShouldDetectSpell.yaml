  method: ShouldDetectSpell
  signature: bool InterruptAwareness::ShouldDetectSpell(Unit * caster, const Spell
    * spell) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a spell cast by a unit should be detected by the interrupt
    awareness system.
  description: The ShouldDetectSpell method evaluates if a given spell cast by a specific
    unit should trigger detection mechanisms within the interrupt awareness system.
    This method is typically used in AI logic to determine when an enemy's spell casting
    should alert or influence the behavior of NPCs or players with interrupt awareness
    capabilities. It considers factors such as spell type, caster status, and detection
    rules defined for the system. The method returns true if the spell should be detected,
    false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is casting the spell. This parameter
      represents the source of the spell being evaluated.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object representing the spell being cast. This
      parameter contains information about the spell properties and behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the spell should be detected by the interrupt awareness
    system, false otherwise. The detection decision is based on spell type, caster
    status, and system-defined rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.ShouldDetectSpell(caster, spell)) {\n    // Trigger\
      \ interrupt awareness behavior\n    HandleInterruptDetection();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell cast event handling
    code: "void AI::OnSpellCast(Unit* caster, const Spell* spell) {\n    if (ShouldDetectSpell(caster,\
      \ spell)) {\n        // Log detection or trigger interrupt response\n      \
      \  DEBUG_LOG(\"Detected spell: %u from unit %u\", spell->m_spellInfo->Id, caster->GetGUIDLow());\n\
      \        TriggerInterruptResponse();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the interrupt awareness system and may be called frequently
    during combat events. The implementation likely includes caching or optimization
    strategies for performance. Developers should ensure that both caster and spell
    parameters are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'caster' and 'spell' parameters are non-null before invoking
    this method, as dereferencing null pointers will cause crashes. The method may
    perform checks on spell properties that could vary based on game state or expansion
    content.
