  class: EconomyManager
  method: PostAuction
  signature: bool EconomyManager::PostAuction(uint32 itemId, uint32 stackSize, uint32
    buyoutPrice, uint32 bidPrice, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Posts an auction for a specified item with given stack size, buyout price,
    bid price, and duration.
  description: The PostAuction method creates a new auction entry in the game's economy
    system for a specific item. It takes parameters defining the item to be auctioned,
    its quantity, pricing information (buyout and bid prices), and the auction duration.
    This method is typically used by players or NPCs to list items for sale on the
    Auction House. The method returns true if the auction was successfully posted,
    or false if there were issues such as invalid parameters, insufficient permissions,
    or system errors. The auction will appear in the auction house interface and can
    be purchased by other players according to the specified terms.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to be auctioned. Must correspond
      to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: stackSize
    description: The number of items in the stack being auctioned. Must be a positive
      integer, typically 1 for most items unless they are stackable.
  - name: buyoutPrice
    description: The fixed price at which the item can be purchased immediately. Set
      to 0 if no buyout is allowed.
  - name: bidPrice
    description: The minimum bid amount required to place a bid on this auction. Must
      be greater than 0 for auctions requiring bidding.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration of the auction in seconds. Valid values are typically
      1800 (30 minutes), 3600 (1 hour), 7200 (2 hours), 14400 (4 hours), or 28800
      (8 hours).
  returns: True if the auction was successfully posted to the auction house, false
    otherwise. Possible failure reasons include invalid item ID, insufficient funds,
    invalid parameters, or system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Posting
    code: "if (economyManager.PostAuction(12345, 1, 100000, 10000, 3600)) {\n    //\
      \ Auction successfully posted\n    printf(\"Auction created for item ID 12345\\\
      n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to post auction\n    printf(\"Failed to create\
      \ auction\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stackable Item Auction
    code: "uint32 stackSize = 5;\nuint32 buyoutPrice = 500000;\nuint32 bidPrice =\
      \ 50000;\nuint32 duration = 7200;\n\nif (economyManager.PostAuction(67890, stackSize,\
      \ buyoutPrice, bidPrice, duration)) {\n    printf(\"Auction created for %u items\
      \ of ID 67890\\n\", stackSize);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method interacts with the auction house system and may have server-side
    validation checks. The item must be owned by the player calling this method, or
    it must be a valid NPC auction item. Auctions are stored in the database and will
    persist across server restarts. The method may trigger additional events such
    as notifications to nearby players or updates to the auction house UI.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this method. Invalid
    item IDs, negative prices, or unsupported durations can cause the method to fail
    silently. Be aware that posting auctions consumes resources and should not be
    called excessively in loops without proper rate limiting.
