  signature: void SpellMgr::LoadSpellInfoCorrections()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and applies spell information corrections from the database into the
    spell manager's internal data structures.
  description: The LoadSpellInfoCorrections method initializes and populates spell-related
    correction data within the SpellMgr class. This method is responsible for reading
    spell modifications, overrides, and adjustments stored in the database tables
    such as spell_fixes or similar correction mechanisms. It ensures that any custom
    or patched spell behaviors are correctly loaded and applied to the game's spell
    system. The method typically runs during server startup or reload operations to
    synchronize the runtime spell data with database corrections. This process is
    crucial for maintaining accurate spell behavior across different expansions, patches,
    or custom modifications.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeSpellManager()\n{\n    sSpellMgr->LoadSpellInfoCorrections();\n\
      \    // Spell corrections are now loaded and active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and spell-related tables have been properly initialized. It's typically invoked
    during server startup sequence before any gameplay begins. The method may perform
    database queries to fetch correction records, so performance could be impacted
    on servers with many spell corrections.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    duplicate entries or memory leaks in the spell correction system. Ensure that
    database connections are stable and spell correction tables contain valid data
    before invoking this method.
