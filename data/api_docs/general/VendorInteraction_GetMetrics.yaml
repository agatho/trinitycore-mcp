  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: VendorMetrics VendorInteraction::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves vendor interaction metrics including transaction counts and revenue
    data.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a VendorMetrics object containing detailed
    statistics about the vendor's interactions, such as total transactions, revenue
    generated, and item sell counts. This method is typically used for tracking vendor
    performance, generating reports, or implementing economy-related features within
    the TrinityCore framework. The returned metrics are cumulative since the vendor
    was last initialized or reset, and they provide insights into player behavior
    and market dynamics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A VendorMetrics object containing key performance indicators for the vendor
    interaction, including transaction counts, total revenue, and item-specific sales
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Vendor Metrics
    code: 'VendorMetrics metrics = vendorInteraction.GetMetrics();

      uint32 totalTransactions = metrics.GetTotalTransactions();

      uint64 totalRevenue = metrics.GetTotalRevenue();

      std::cout << "Total Transactions: " << totalTransactions << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Total Revenue: " << totalRevenue << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    metrics are updated in real-time during vendor interactions, so calling this method
    multiple times will reflect the most current data. Performance impact is minimal
    as it only reads pre-computed values.
  warnings: Ensure that the VendorInteraction object is properly initialized before
    calling GetMetrics, otherwise the returned metrics may be invalid or uninitialized.
    Avoid modifying the returned VendorMetrics object directly as changes won't affect
    the original vendor state.
