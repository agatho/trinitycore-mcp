  class: InRangeCheckCustomizer
  method: Test
  signature: bool InRangeCheckCustomizer::Test(const int * o) const
documentation:
  brief: Tests if a given object is within range using custom criteria defined by
    the InRangeCheckCustomizer.
  description: 'The Test method evaluates whether a specified object, represented
    by a pointer to an integer, satisfies the range conditions set forth by the InRangeCheckCustomizer
    instance. This functionality is typically used in game systems where entities
    must be checked against specific spatial or contextual boundaries. The method
    performs a custom range check based on internal logic that may involve distance
    calculations, object types, or other game-specific constraints. It returns true
    if the object passes all range checks, and false otherwise. Precondition: The
    input pointer ''o'' should not be null; Postcondition: The method does not modify
    any state within the InRangeCheckCustomizer instance.'
  parameters:
  - name: o
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the object to be tested for
      range inclusion. This parameter is expected to point to a valid integer value
      that uniquely identifies or represents the object in question.
  returns: Returns true if the object pointed to by 'o' meets the custom range criteria
    defined by this InRangeCheckCustomizer instance; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of Test method
    code: 'InRangeCheckCustomizer checker;

      int testObject = 12345;

      bool result = checker.Test(&testObject);

      // ''result'' will be true or false depending on whether ''testObject'' passes
      the custom range check.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing spatial awareness
    and object interactions in TrinityCore. It's important to ensure that the integer
    pointed to by 'o' represents a valid entity identifier or coordinate value within
    the context where this check is performed.
  warnings: Ensure that the pointer passed to 'o' is not null, as dereferencing a
    null pointer will lead to undefined behavior and likely crash the application.
    Also, be aware that the internal logic of the range check may vary depending on
    how the InRangeCheckCustomizer was initialized or configured.
