documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the area trigger spline calculator.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask flag within
    the AreaTriggerSplineCalculator class. This operation typically indicates that
    any previously tracked modifications to the area trigger's spline data have been
    processed or acknowledged, and the mask should be cleared to avoid unnecessary
    recalculations or updates. The method is commonly used in conjunction with area
    trigger update logic where changes need to be monitored and subsequently reset
    after processing.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AreaTriggerSplineCalculator calculator;

      calculator.ClearChangesMask();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the update cycle of an area trigger
    to ensure that changes are properly tracked and reset after being handled. It
    may be used internally by the core engine when processing area trigger events.
