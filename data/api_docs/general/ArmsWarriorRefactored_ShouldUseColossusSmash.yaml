  method: ShouldUseColossusSmash
  signature: bool ArmsWarriorRefactored::ShouldUseColossusSmash(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether Colossus Smash should be used against a target based on
    combat conditions and cooldown status.
  description: This method evaluates if the Arms Warrior should use the Colossus Smash
    ability against a specified target. It considers factors such as the target's
    health percentage, available rage, and the cooldown state of Colossus Smash. The
    function is typically used within the AI decision-making process to determine
    optimal spell usage during combat. This method does not directly cast the spell
    but returns a boolean value indicating whether casting would be beneficial under
    current conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Colossus Smash should be used against the target, false
    otherwise. The decision is based on combat state, resource availability, and target
    vulnerability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (player->GetAI()->ShouldUseColossusSmash(target)) {\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ COLLOSSUS_SMASH_SPELL_ID, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Warrior AI
    code: "bool ArmsWarriorRefactored::UpdateCombatAI() {\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (ShouldUseColossusSmash(target)) {\n        // Execute Colossus Smash\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Arms Warrior's combat decision logic and should
    be called within a combat context where target information is valid. It assumes
    that the player has sufficient rage to cast Colossus Smash and that the ability
    is not on cooldown.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as using an invalid target may lead to incorrect decisions or unexpected
    behavior in combat AI logic.
