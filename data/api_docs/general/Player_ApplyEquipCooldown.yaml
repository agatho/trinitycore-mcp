  class: Player
  method: ApplyEquipCooldown
  signature: void Player::ApplyEquipCooldown(Item * pItem)
documentation:
  brief: Applies cooldown period to an equipped item.
  description: This method applies a cooldown period to an item that is currently
    equipped on the player. It is used to prevent the item from being used again until
    the cooldown expires, which is essential for balancing game mechanics and preventing
    overuse of abilities or items. The method typically handles the cooldown logic
    for items that have cooldowns associated with them, such as weapons or armor pieces
    that can be used multiple times before cooldowns apply.
  parameters:
  - name: pItem
    description: Pointer to the item object that will have its cooldown applied. This
      must be a valid item pointer and should represent an equipped item on the player's
      character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Item* item = new Item();

      player->ApplyEquipCooldown(item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when an item
    is equipped or used, and it may involve updating the cooldown timer for the item.
    It's important to note that this method does not directly handle cooldowns for
    items with no cooldowns; those are usually handled through other mechanisms.
  warnings: This method should only be called on valid item pointers. Calling it on
    null or invalid items can cause crashes or undefined behavior. Additionally, ensure
    that the item is actually equipped before calling this method, as applying cooldown
    to unequipped items may not behave as expected.
