  method: GetIds
  signature: std::span<const EntityFragment> EntityFragmentsHolder::GetIds() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a read-only view of all entity fragments stored in the holder.
  description: The GetIds method provides access to the collection of EntityFragment
    objects managed by this EntityFragmentsHolder instance. It returns a std::span<const
    EntityFragment> which offers a safe, bounds-checked view into the underlying data
    without transferring ownership. This method is typically used to iterate over
    or inspect the fragments without modifying them. The returned span remains valid
    as long as the EntityFragmentsHolder instance exists and its internal collection
    is not modified externally.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::span<const EntityFragment> representing a read-only view of all
    entity fragments stored in the holder. The span provides safe access to the elements
    without copying or taking ownership of the data.
  examples:
  - title: Iterating through all entity fragments
    code: "EntityFragmentsHolder holder;\n// ... populate holder with fragments ...\n\
      for (const auto& fragment : holder.GetIds()) {\n    // Process each fragment\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Fragment ID: \" << fragment.GetId() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if any fragment meets a condition
    code: "EntityFragmentsHolder holder;\n// ... populate holder with fragments ...\n\
      bool hasSpecificFragment = std::ranges::any_of(holder.GetIds(), [](const EntityFragment&\
      \ f) {\n    return f.GetType() == FragmentType::Special;\n});\nif (hasSpecificFragment)\
      \ {\n    // Handle special fragment case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned std::span is a view into the internal data structure and should
    not be stored beyond the lifetime of the EntityFragmentsHolder instance. The method
    does not perform any copying or allocation, making it efficient for read-only
    access patterns.
