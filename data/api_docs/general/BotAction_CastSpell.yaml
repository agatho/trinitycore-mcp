  class: BotAction
  method: CastSpell
  signature: BotAction BotAction::CastSpell(int bot, uint32 spell, int target, uint32
    timestamp)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a spell casting action for a bot with specified parameters.
  description: The CastSpell method is used to trigger a spell casting action by a
    bot within the TrinityCore framework. It allows specifying which bot performs
    the action, which spell to cast, the target of the spell, and a timestamp for
    when the action should occur. This method is typically used in AI scripting or
    automated gameplay scenarios where bots need to perform actions like casting spells
    on targets. The method returns a BotAction object that represents the initiated
    spell casting operation, enabling chaining of actions or further manipulation
    of the casting sequence.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: The identifier of the bot that will cast the spell. This is typically
      a unique integer value representing the bot's instance within the game world.
  - name: spell
    description: The spell ID to be cast, as defined in the game's spell database.
      This must correspond to a valid spell entry in the TrinityCore spell system.
  - name: target
    description: The target of the spell casting action. This can represent either
      a unit ID or a specific target type depending on how the AI system interprets
      targets.
  - name: timestamp
    description: The time at which the spell casting should be executed, represented
      as a Unix timestamp or game tick value. This allows for delayed or scheduled
      spell casting.
  returns: Returns a BotAction object that represents the initiated spell casting
    action. This returned object can be used to track or modify the action later in
    the AI execution flow.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Casting
    code: BotAction action = botAction.CastSpell(12345, 45678, 98765, 1609459200);
    language: cpp
  - title: Casting a Healing Spell on Self
    code: BotAction action = botAction.CastSpell(botId, 12345, botId, time(nullptr));
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target entities exist in the game world
    and are accessible. It does not validate whether the spell can actually be cast
    by the bot or if the target is valid; such checks should be performed before calling
    this method. The timestamp parameter allows for precise control over when the
    spell is cast, useful for creating timed sequences of actions.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in invalid spell
    casts or errors if the specified bot does not exist, the spell ID is invalid,
    or the target is unreachable. Ensure all parameters are valid before invoking
    this function to avoid unexpected behavior.
