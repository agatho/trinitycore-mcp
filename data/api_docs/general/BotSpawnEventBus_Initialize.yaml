  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotSpawnEventBus::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot spawn event bus system for handling bot-related spawning
    events in the game world.
  description: The Initialize method sets up and prepares the BotSpawnEventBus for
    processing bot spawning events. This includes registering necessary event handlers,
    initializing internal data structures, and ensuring all required subsystems are
    ready to handle bot creation and management events. The method typically runs
    during server startup or when the bot system is enabled, establishing the foundation
    for bot-related gameplay mechanics such as automatic bot spawning, respawn handling,
    and event-driven bot lifecycle management. It performs essential setup operations
    that allow the system to properly respond to various game events related to bot
    behavior and deployment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the initialization was successful and all subsystems were
    properly set up; returns false if any critical error occurred during the initialization
    process, indicating that the event bus may not function correctly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "if (BotSpawnEventBus::Initialize()) {\n    // Bot spawn event bus successfully\
      \ initialized\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot spawn event bus initialized successfully.\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to initialize bot spawn event bus.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Multiple
    calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method assumes that
    all required dependencies and subsystems are already available in the TrinityCore
    environment.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the server has started processing gameplay
    events, as it may interfere with existing event handling. Ensure that no other
    threads are accessing the bot spawn system during initialization to prevent race
    conditions.
