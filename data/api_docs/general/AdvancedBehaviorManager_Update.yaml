  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: Update
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the advanced behavior manager's internal state and processes AI logic
    based on the elapsed time since last update.
  description: The Update method is a core function of the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    class that handles the periodic execution of AI behaviors and state management.
    It is typically called by the game loop at regular intervals, using the provided
    'diff' parameter to determine how much time has passed since the last update.
    This method processes all active behaviors, evaluates conditions, executes actions,
    and manages the lifecycle of AI states. The implementation ensures that behaviors
    are updated in a timely manner according to game timing mechanics, maintaining
    consistent AI behavior across different server loads and frame rates.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based behavior updates and ensure proper timing
      of AI actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    // ... other game\
      \ logic ...\n    advancedBehaviorManager.Update(diff);\n    // ... rest of game\
      \ loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Time Delta Management
    code: "class MyAIManager\n{\npublic:\n    void Update(uint32 diff)\n    {\n  \
      \      // Process behaviors with time delta\n        behaviorManager.Update(diff);\n\
      \        \n        // Handle any time-based logic\n        if (lastUpdateTime\
      \ + 1000 < getMSTime())\n        {\n            // Perform periodic tasks\n\
      \            lastUpdateTime = getMSTime();\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n   \
      \ uint32 lastUpdateTime = 0;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop.
    The 'diff' parameter must represent actual elapsed time to ensure proper AI timing
    behavior. The implementation may internally batch or delay certain operations
    based on performance considerations.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the main game thread as it may cause
    race conditions. Avoid calling Update with incorrect time deltas, as this can
    lead to erratic AI behavior or missed updates.
