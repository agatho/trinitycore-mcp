documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and state reset when a hunter's combat session ends
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is invoked when a hunter AI transitions out
    of combat mode. This method performs necessary cleanup operations such as resetting
    combat-related flags, clearing target references, and ensuring the AI returns
    to its default non-combat state. It is typically called by the core game loop
    when the hunter's combat timer expires or when the hunter successfully disengages
    from battle. The method ensures that the AI properly transitions back to idle
    behavior and releases any resources or references held during combat.

  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyHunterAI : public HunterAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd() override\
      \ {\n        // Custom cleanup logic\n        HunterAI::OnCombatEnd();\n   \
      \     // Additional post-combat actions\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI lifecycle and should not be called
    manually unless implementing a custom AI behavior. The base implementation handles
    core cleanup tasks, so derived classes should typically call the parent implementation
    to ensure proper state management.
