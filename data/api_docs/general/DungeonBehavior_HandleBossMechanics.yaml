  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleBossMechanics(Group * group, uint32 encounterId,
    const std::string & mechanic)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies boss encounter mechanics to a group during dungeon
    encounters.
  description: The HandleBossMechanics method is responsible for managing and executing
    specific mechanical behaviors associated with boss encounters within dungeon scenarios.
    It takes a group of players, an encounter identifier, and a mechanic string to
    determine how to apply the specified behavior to the group. This method likely
    coordinates with the game's encounter system to ensure proper mechanics execution,
    such as applying debuffs, triggering events, or modifying player states during
    boss fights. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's dungeon and
    raid encounter handling framework.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the players participating
      in the dungeon encounter. Must not be null.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific boss encounter being processed.
      Used to determine which mechanics should be applied.
  - name: mechanic
    description: String identifier describing the specific mechanic to be handled.
      The format and valid values depend on the encounter implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic boss mechanic handling
    code: 'DungeonBehavior behavior;

      Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      behavior.HandleBossMechanics(group, 12345, "phase_two");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying debuff mechanic to encounter
    code: 'DungeonBehavior behavior;

      Group* raidGroup = instance->GetPlayers();

      behavior.HandleBossMechanics(raidGroup, 67890, "apply_debuff");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger encounter management system and may
    interact with various subsystems including player state tracking, event triggering,
    and group synchronization. The mechanic string parameter should be validated against
    known mechanics to prevent unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereferences. The encounterId must correspond to an actual encounter
    defined in the game's database to ensure proper mechanics application.
