  brief: Sends a GUID warning message to all connected players
  description: The SendGuidWarning method broadcasts a warning message to all currently
    connected players in the world. This method is typically used to alert players
    about potential issues with GUID handling, such as duplicate or invalid GUIDs
    that could cause gameplay disruptions. The warning is sent through the standard
    chat system and may include additional context about the nature of the GUID issue
    detected. This method does not require any parameters and operates on the global
    world instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: World::instance()->SendGuidWarning();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the World's chat system to broadcast warnings. It
    may be called automatically by internal systems when GUID inconsistencies are
    detected, or manually triggered for debugging purposes. The warning message format
    and content would depend on the implementation within TrinityCore.
