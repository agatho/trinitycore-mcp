documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an arena team object by its unique identifier from the arena team
    manager.
  description: The GetArenaTeamById method fetches a pointer to an ArenaTeam object
    using its unique identifier (arenaTeamId). This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to access specific arena teams for operations such as
    retrieving team statistics, managing roster changes, or handling arena match logic.
    The method performs a lookup in an internal container that maps arena team IDs
    to their corresponding ArenaTeam instances. It's important to note that this method
    may return a null pointer if no arena team with the specified ID exists in the
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ArenaTeam object associated with the given arenaTeamId,
    or nullptr if no such arena team exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    // Use the arena team object\n    sLog->outString(\"Found arena team:\
      \ %s\", team->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Team Existence Before Access
    code: "uint32 teamId = 54321;\nArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(teamId);\n\
      if (team != nullptr)\n{\n    // Safe to use team object\n    uint32 size = team->GetMembers().size();\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Team %u has %u members.\", teamId, size);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    sLog->outString(\"Arena team with ID %u does not exist.\", teamId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which is generally efficient due
    to internal indexing. However, repeated calls with different IDs may cause performance
    overhead if the arena team manager's internal container is not optimized for such
    operations. The returned pointer should always be validated before use.
  warnings: Always check the return value for null before dereferencing the ArenaTeam
    pointer. Accessing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior and likely
    crash the server. Be aware that arena teams may be destroyed or removed from memory
    during server operation, so caching pointers to arena teams should be done with
    caution.
