  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordLockWaitTime
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::RecordLockWaitTime(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records the time a bot spent waiting for a lock in microseconds.
  description: The RecordLockWaitTime method is used to log the duration of time a
    bot has waited for a lock acquisition. This is typically called by the performance
    monitoring system to track contention and synchronization overhead within the
    bot's execution context. The method accepts a single parameter representing the
    wait time in microseconds, which allows for precise measurement of lock contention.
    This data is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks related to thread
    synchronization and resource access patterns in multi-threaded bot environments.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The duration of time (in microseconds) that a bot waited for a lock
      to become available. This value should be a non-negative integer representing
      the actual wait time measured during lock acquisition.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = GetBotPerformanceMonitor();

      uint64 waitTime = 500; // 500 microseconds

      monitor->RecordLockWaitTime(waitTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Timing Measurement
    code: '#include <chrono>

      IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = GetBotPerformanceMonitor();

      auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      // Simulate lock acquisition attempt

      std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex_);

      auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

      uint64 waitTime = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end
      - start).count();

      monitor->RecordLockWaitTime(waitTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within a bot's execution context when
    it encounters a lock contention scenario. The recorded data contributes to overall
    performance metrics and can be used for profiling and optimization purposes. It's
    important to note that this method does not perform any locking itself, but rather
    records timing data which should be thread-safe if called from multiple threads.
  warnings: Ensure that the microseconds parameter accurately reflects the actual
    wait time to avoid skewed performance data. Calling this method with negative
    values or extremely large values may lead to incorrect profiling results and should
    be avoided.
