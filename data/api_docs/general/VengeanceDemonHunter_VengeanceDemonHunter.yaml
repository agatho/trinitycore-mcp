  class: VengeanceDemonHunter
  method: VengeanceDemonHunter
  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunter::VengeanceDemonHunter(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a VengeanceDemonHunter AI class for a player bot with specified
    player reference.
  description: The VengeanceDemonHunter constructor initializes the AI behavior for
    a Demon Hunter player bot using the Vengeance specialization. This method sets
    up internal state variables, registers necessary event handlers, and prepares
    the bot for combat decision-making based on the Vengeance demon hunter's abilities
    and talents. The initialization process includes configuring ability cooldowns,
    resource management logic, and targeting strategies specific to the Vengeance
    build. It is typically called during the creation or activation of an AI-controlled
    Demon Hunter character in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Demon Hunter bot that
      will be controlled by this AI class. Must not be null and should represent a
      valid player with Demon Hunter class and Vengeance specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of VengeanceDemonHunter
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create a Demon Hunter bot

      VengeanceDemonHunter vengeanceAI(myBot);

      // The AI is now initialized and ready to control the bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using VengeanceDemonHunter in AI Manager Context
    code: "class AIManager {\npublic:\n    void InitializeDemonHunter(Player* player)\
      \ {\n        if (player->getClass() == CLASS_DEMON_HUNTER && player->GetSpecializationId()\
      \ == SPEC_DEMON_HUNTER_VENGEANCE) {\n            new VengeanceDemonHunter(player);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes the provided Player object is already validated
    and has correct class/specialization. The AI system relies on TrinityCore's event
    handling framework for real-time updates. Performance considerations include avoiding
    expensive operations during initialization, as this method may be called frequently
    during bot creation.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized and
    represents a valid Demon Hunter with Vengeance specialization before calling this
    constructor.
