  signature: bool BlackMarketEntry::IsCompleted() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a black market item entry has been completed.
  description: The IsCompleted method checks if a BlackMarketEntry object represents
    an item that has already been successfully acquired or processed within the black
    market system. This typically indicates that the player has either purchased the
    item, received it as a reward, or the auction has concluded with a successful
    outcome. The method returns true if the entry's state reflects completion, and
    false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for managing the lifecycle of black
    market auctions and ensuring proper state tracking for items in the game's economy
    system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the black market entry has been completed (e.g., item acquired
    or auction finalized), false if it remains active or pending completion.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Black Market Item is Completed
    code: "if (blackMarketEntry->IsCompleted()) {\n    // Handle completed item logic\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Black market item has been completed.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle active auction logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Black market item\
      \ is still active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal state flags or database values to determine
    completion status. It should be called frequently during auction processing to
    maintain accurate state tracking.
