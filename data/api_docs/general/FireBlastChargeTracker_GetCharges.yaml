  class: FireBlastChargeTracker
  method: GetCharges
  signature: uint32 FireBlastChargeTracker::GetCharges() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of fire blast charges available to the player.
  description: The GetCharges method returns the count of fire blast charges currently
    possessed by the player. This method is typically used in conjunction with abilities
    that consume or generate charges, such as the Fire Blast spell in World of Warcraft's
    Mage class. The returned value represents how many times the ability can be cast
    before requiring a recharge. This method does not modify any internal state and
    is safe to call at any time during gameplay. It provides a read-only view of the
    current charge count.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of fire blast charges currently
    available. Returns zero if no charges are available or if the player does not
    have the fire blast ability equipped.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 charges = player->GetCharges();\nif (charges > 0)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ can cast Fire Blast\n    player->CastSpell(target, FIRE_BLAST_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      \    player->ModifyCharges(-1); // Consume one charge\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Charge Management
    code: "FireBlastChargeTracker* tracker = player->GetFireBlastChargeTracker();\n\
      uint32 currentCharges = tracker->GetCharges();\nif (currentCharges < MAX_FIRE_BLAST_CHARGES)\n\
      {\n    // Regenerate charges over time or through other means\n    tracker->AddCharge();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Max charges reached, no more regeneration possible\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically part of a charge-based system where abilities can
    be cast multiple times before requiring a cooldown or recharge period. The implementation
    likely uses an internal counter that tracks the number of available charges and
    may be updated through various game events such as spell casting, buff expiration,
    or periodic regeneration.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with charge modification
    functions, as improper handling can lead to inconsistent charge states. Ensure
    proper synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
