  class: GuildBankManager
  method: DepositExcessConsumables
  signature: void GuildBankManager::DepositExcessConsumables(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Deposits excess consumable items from a player's inventory into the guild
    bank.
  description: The DepositExcessConsumables method handles the automatic transfer
    of consumable items (such as potions, food, and other usable items) that exceed
    the guild bank's configured limits for a specific player. This function is typically
    invoked when a player attempts to deposit items into the guild bank, and it ensures
    that only the allowed quantity of each consumable type is stored, while excess
    items are either returned to the player or handled according to guild configuration
    settings. The method operates on the player's current inventory state and modifies
    the guild bank storage accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's inventory is being processed
      for excess consumable depositing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.DepositExcessConsumables(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger guild management system and may be
    called during player logout or specific guild bank interaction events. It assumes
    the existence of a valid player GUID and appropriate guild bank configuration
    settings.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player GUID pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the player exists in the game world before calling this method.
