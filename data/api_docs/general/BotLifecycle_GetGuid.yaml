documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot instance
  description: The GetGuid method retrieves the globally unique identifier assigned
    to this bot instance within the TrinityCore framework. This GUID is used internally
    by the game server to uniquely identify and track the bot across different systems
    and subsystems. The returned integer value represents a persistent identifier
    that remains consistent throughout the bot's lifecycle. This method is typically
    used for referencing the bot in database operations, network communications, or
    when integrating with other TrinityCore systems that require unique identification
    of game entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique global identifier (GUID) of this bot
    instance. The value is guaranteed to be positive and unique within the context
    of the running TrinityCore server instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLifecycle* bot = new BotLifecycle();

      int guid = bot->GetGuid();

      printf("Bot GUID: %d\n", guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID for Database Operations
    code: 'BotLifecycle* bot = GetBotByIndex(0);

      int guid = bot->GetGuid();

      // Use GUID to query or update bot data in database

      std::string query = "SELECT * FROM bot_data WHERE guid = " + std::to_string(guid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The GUID returned by this method is generated during bot initialization and
    remains constant throughout the bot's existence. This identifier is not the same
    as a player's GUID or creature GUID, but rather a unique identifier specific to
    the bot management system within TrinityCore.
