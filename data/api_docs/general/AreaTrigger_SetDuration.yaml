  class: AreaTrigger
  method: SetDuration
  signature: void AreaTrigger::SetDuration(int32 newDuration)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duration of the area trigger in milliseconds.
  description: The SetDuration method configures the active lifetime of an area trigger,
    determining how long it will remain active before expiring. This is commonly used
    for spells or effects that create temporary area-based interactions such as auras,
    traps, or environmental effects. The duration value is typically specified in
    milliseconds and directly influences when the area trigger's event handlers are
    invoked and when the trigger is removed from the game world. Setting a duration
    of zero or negative values may result in immediate expiration of the trigger.
  parameters:
  - name: newDuration
    description: The new duration for the area trigger, specified in milliseconds.
      A value of zero or less will cause the trigger to expire immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Area Trigger Duration to 5 Seconds
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(12345);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    trigger->SetDuration(5000); // Set duration to 5 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Extend Duration of Existing Area Trigger
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = player->GetAreaTrigger(67890);\nif (trigger)\n{\n\
      \    int32 currentDuration = trigger->GetDuration();\n    trigger->SetDuration(currentDuration\
      \ + 3000); // Extend by 3 seconds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal timer of the area trigger. It
    is typically called during spell effects or game events where dynamic duration
    adjustment is required. The change takes effect immediately without requiring
    additional processing.
  warnings: Modifying the duration of an active area trigger while it's already in
    use may cause unexpected behavior if other systems depend on its original timing.
    Ensure that any duration changes are synchronized with the overall spell or effect
    logic.
