documentation:
  brief: Evaluates the effectiveness of combat abilities and adjusts AI behavior accordingly
  description: The AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness method performs a comprehensive assessment
    of the warrior's current combat performance by analyzing various factors such
    as damage output, threat generation, target health percentages, and ability cooldowns.
    This method is typically invoked during combat to dynamically modify the AI's
    decision-making process and optimize tactical choices. The analysis considers
    both immediate combat state and historical performance data to determine whether
    the warrior should switch between different combat strategies, such as focusing
    on high-damage abilities versus maintaining threat or using defensive cooldowns.
    The method does not directly perform any actions but rather updates internal AI
    state variables that influence subsequent behavior decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n    \n    AnalyzeCombatEffectiveness();\n    \n    // Continue\
      \ with normal AI logic\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked outside of combat situations. The analysis performed may have performance
    implications during high-frequency combat updates, so it's optimized to avoid
    expensive operations. The method relies on accurate combat state information being
    maintained by the AI system.
  warnings: Do not call this method when the warrior is not in combat as it may produce
    undefined behavior or incorrect results. The method assumes that all combat-related
    data structures are properly initialized and updated before execution.
