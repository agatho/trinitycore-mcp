  class: BotSpawnerAdapter
  method: GetOrchestrator
  signature: BotSpawnOrchestrator * BotSpawnerAdapter::GetOrchestrator() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the bot spawn orchestrator instance associated with this adapter.
  description: The GetOrchestrator method returns a pointer to the BotSpawnOrchestrator
    object that manages the spawning and control logic for bot instances within the
    TrinityCore environment. This method provides access to the central orchestrator
    responsible for coordinating bot behavior, spawn patterns, and lifecycle management.
    The returned pointer is typically used by other components to interact with the
    bot spawning system, such as requesting new spawns, querying current bot states,
    or modifying spawn configurations. The method is designed to be called from within
    the same thread context where the adapter was initialized, though it may be safe
    to call from different threads depending on internal synchronization mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotSpawnOrchestrator instance if one has been assigned
    to this adapter; otherwise, returns nullptr. The returned pointer should not be
    deleted or managed by the caller as it is owned by the adapter and managed internally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotSpawnerAdapter* adapter = new BotSpawnerAdapter();\nBotSpawnOrchestrator*\
      \ orchestrator = adapter->GetOrchestrator();\nif (orchestrator != nullptr) {\n\
      \    // Use the orchestrator to manage bot spawns\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with BotSpawnerAdapter initialization
    and should not be called before a valid orchestrator has been assigned. The returned
    orchestrator pointer remains valid for as long as the adapter exists, but may
    become invalid if the adapter is destroyed or reset.
