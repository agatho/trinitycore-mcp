  brief: Force casts a spell effect, triggering the spell's activation and handling
    its associated mechanics.
  description: The EffectForceCast method is responsible for executing a spell's effect
    in the game world, typically used when a spell needs to be activated or triggered.
    This method handles the core mechanics of spell casting, including applying effects,
    managing cooldowns, and ensuring proper execution of the spell's behavior. It
    is commonly invoked during spell activation processes, particularly when dealing
    with direct damage spells, healing spells, or other effects that require immediate
    action. The method may also handle various game mechanics such as target selection,
    resource consumption, and effect application. It is crucial for developers to
    understand that this method does not directly perform the actual casting but rather
    initiates the spell's execution sequence.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system when a spell
    needs to be executed. It may involve handling various spell effects and their
    associated mechanics, including target selection, resource management, and cooldowns.
    Performance considerations are minimal as this method is usually part of a larger
    spell execution process.
