  method: GetSoundTurnIn
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetSoundTurnIn() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the sound ID played when a player turns in a quest.
  description: The GetSoundTurnIn method retrieves the sound ID associated with quest
    completion for a specific quest. This sound is typically played when a player
    successfully turns in a quest to an NPC, indicating that the quest has been completed.
    The method is part of the Quest class and provides access to the sound data associated
    with quest completion mechanics. It is commonly used in conjunction with other
    quest-related methods to determine the appropriate audio feedback for quest completion
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the sound ID that plays when a player turns
    in a quest. This value corresponds to a specific sound entry in the game's sound
    database, typically related to quest completion or reward sounds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 soundId = quest->GetSoundTurnIn();\nif (soundId > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Play the sound when quest is turned in\n    sSoundMgr->PlaySound(soundId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to ensure proper audio feedback during quest completion. The returned value may
    be zero if no sound is associated with the specific quest, indicating that no
    sound should play.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return zero values
    for quests that do not have associated sounds. Also note that this method does
    not directly play the sound; it only returns the ID which can then be used to
    play the sound via other systems.
