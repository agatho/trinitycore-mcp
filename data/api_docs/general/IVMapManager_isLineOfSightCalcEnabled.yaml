  signature: bool IVMapManager::isLineOfSightCalcEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether line-of-sight calculations are currently enabled in the VMap
    manager.
  description: The isLineOfSightCalcEnabled method returns a boolean value indicating
    if the line-of-sight (LOS) calculation feature is active within the IVMapManager.
    This functionality is crucial for determining whether objects in the game world
    can see each other directly, which affects various gameplay mechanics such as
    spell casting, AI behavior, and visibility checks. When enabled, the system performs
    detailed collision detection between points to determine if an unobstructed path
    exists. The method does not require any parameters and provides a simple on/off
    status check for this essential navigation feature.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A boolean value indicating the current state of line-of-sight calculations:
    true if enabled, false if disabled.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check LOS status
    code: "if (VMapFactory::createVMapManager()->isLineOfSightCalcEnabled()) {\n \
      \   // Perform LOS-dependent operations\n    printf(\"Line-of-sight calculations\
      \ are enabled\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Line-of-sight calculations are\
      \ disabled\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the VMap system and may be toggled
    based on performance considerations or game state. It's important to note that
    disabling line-of-sight calculations can significantly impact gameplay mechanics
    that rely on visual obstruction detection.
