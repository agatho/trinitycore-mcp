  brief: Initializes all cooldowns for the Balance Druid class
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for a Balance Druid character. This method is typically called during player
    initialization or when switching to the Balance Druid specialization. It ensures
    that all druid-specific abilities, spells, and talents have their proper cooldown
    states initialized according to game mechanics and class requirements. The method
    handles internal state management for spell cooldowns, ability recovery times,
    and any specialized balance druid mechanics that depend on timed resets.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during character setup or specialization
    change. It is not intended to be called repeatedly during gameplay as it may reset
    cooldown states unexpectedly.
