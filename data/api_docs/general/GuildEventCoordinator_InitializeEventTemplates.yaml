documentation:
  brief: Initializes all guild event templates for the coordinator
  description: The InitializeEventTemplates method sets up and loads all predefined
    guild event templates into the GuildEventCoordinator. This method is typically
    called during server startup or when the coordinator needs to refresh its event
    template cache. It ensures that all available guild events are properly registered
    and ready for use by guild members when creating or managing events. The method
    iterates through all defined event types and prepares their configurations, including
    validation rules, required parameters, and default settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.InitializeEventTemplates();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the coordinator's initialization
    phase. Repeated calls may result in duplicate template registrations or memory
    leaks. The method performs no locking internally, so callers should ensure thread
    safety if multiple threads access the coordinator simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method after events have already been created may cause inconsistencies
    in existing guild event data. Avoid calling this method during active gameplay
    sessions to prevent potential race conditions or data corruption.
