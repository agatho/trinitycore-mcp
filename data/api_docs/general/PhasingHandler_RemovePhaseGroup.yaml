  class: PhasingHandler
  method: RemovePhaseGroup
  signature: void PhasingHandler::RemovePhaseGroup(WorldObject * object, uint32 phaseGroupId,
    bool updateVisibility)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified phase group from a WorldObject's phasing state.
  description: The RemovePhaseGroup method removes a phase group from a given WorldObject,
    effectively removing it from the phasing system. This allows the object to become
    visible or invisible based on the remaining phase groups in its phasing state.
    The updateVisibility parameter determines whether visibility should be recalculated
    immediately after removing the phase group. This is commonly used when objects
    need to transition between different visual states or when phase restrictions
    are no longer applicable.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject from which the phase group will be removed.
      Must not be null.
  - name: phaseGroupId
    description: The unique identifier of the phase group to remove. This ID must
      correspond to an existing phase group in the system.
  - name: updateVisibility
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to immediately update the visibility
      state of the object after removing the phase group. If true, visibility will
      be recalculated; if false, visibility remains unchanged until next update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Phase Group from a Player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      PhasingHandler::RemovePhaseGroup(player, 12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Phase Group Without Immediate Visibility Update
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      PhasingHandler::RemovePhaseGroup(creature, 67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the phasing system which controls object visibility
    in World of Warcraft. It's important to ensure that phase group IDs are valid
    and correspond to existing groups in the database or system. The updateVisibility
    flag can impact performance if called frequently without necessity.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null object pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the phaseGroupId exists before attempting removal, otherwise
    the operation may silently fail or cause inconsistencies in phasing logic.
