  method: AddLooter
  signature: void Loot::AddLooter(int GUID)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player GUID to the loot's looter list for tracking eligible players.
  description: The AddLooter method is used to register a player's unique identifier
    (GUID) into the loot system's internal list of players who are eligible to receive
    loot. This method is typically invoked when a player participates in the loot
    roll process or when loot is awarded to a specific player. It ensures that the
    player is tracked as a potential recipient and may influence loot distribution
    mechanics such as group loot, personal loot, or free-for-all loot depending on
    the context and settings of the loot object. The method does not perform any validation
    on the GUID itself but assumes it refers to a valid player in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: GUID
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added as a looter.
      This should correspond to a valid player entity within the TrinityCore world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Player GUID to Loot
    code: 'Loot* loot = new Loot();

      loot->AddLooter(12345);

      // Adds player with GUID 12345 to the list of eligible looters.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Looters
    code: 'Loot* loot = new Loot();

      loot->AddLooter(12345);

      loot->AddLooter(12346);

      loot->AddLooter(12347);

      // Registers three players as potential loot recipients.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal loot tracking mechanism and is usually
    called automatically during loot generation or distribution events. It does not
    directly award items to players but rather prepares the system for proper loot
    assignment based on player eligibility.
