  class: PathOptimizer
  method: InterpolatePosition
  signature: int PathOptimizer::InterpolatePosition(const int & start, const int &
    end, float t) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns an interpolated position between two path points based
    on a normalized time value.
  description: The InterpolatePosition method performs linear interpolation between
    two consecutive path points in a movement path. It takes a start point index,
    an end point index, and a normalized time parameter 't' (typically between 0.0f
    and 1.0f) to determine the exact position along the path segment. This is commonly
    used in AI pathfinding and character movement systems to smoothly transition between
    waypoints. The method returns the index of the interpolated position or an error
    code if the interpolation cannot be performed due to invalid parameters or path
    state issues.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The index of the starting point in the path array. Must be a valid
      index within the bounds of the current path.
  - name: end
    description: The index of the ending point in the path array. Must be a valid
      index and typically should be the next point after 'start'.
  - name: t
    description: A normalized time value between 0.0f and 1.0f representing the interpolation
      factor. A value of 0.0f returns the start position, 1.0f returns the end position,
      and values in between return interpolated positions.
  returns: Returns an integer index representing the interpolated position in the
    path array. Returns -1 if the interpolation fails due to invalid parameters or
    path state issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic interpolation between two points
    code: int result = optimizer.InterpolatePosition(0, 1, 0.5f); // Get midpoint
      between first and second path points
    language: cpp
  - title: Interpolating at different time values
    code: 'float t = 0.25f;

      int pos1 = optimizer.InterpolatePosition(2, 3, t); // 25% along path segment

      int pos2 = optimizer.InterpolatePosition(2, 3, 0.75f); // 75% along path segment'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other path optimization
    functions and assumes that the path points are already defined and valid. The
    interpolation is linear and does not account for complex movement patterns such
    as curves or acceleration.
  warnings: Ensure that the start and end indices are valid and consecutive within
    the path array. Using invalid indices may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    interpolation results. The time parameter 't' should be clamped between 0.0f and
    1.0f for meaningful results.
