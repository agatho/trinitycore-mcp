  class: TankPositionStrategy
  method: GetTankingPosition
  signature: int TankPositionStrategy::GetTankingPosition(Unit * target, bool mainTank)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal positioning for a tank unit relative to
    its target.
  description: The GetTankingPosition method determines the appropriate position a
    tank should maintain in relation to its target unit during combat. This method
    is typically used by AI systems to calculate positioning strategies that ensure
    optimal threat generation, aggro management, and overall tank effectiveness. The
    method considers factors such as the target's size, movement patterns, and the
    tank's own capabilities to determine an ideal positioning strategy. It returns
    a numeric value representing the calculated position, which may be interpreted
    by the calling system to adjust the tank's location or behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that represents the target the tank is
      engaging. This parameter must not be null for valid results.
  - name: mainTank
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the current unit is the main tank
      in a group context. When true, positioning may account for main tank responsibilities
      such as maintaining aggro and positioning for group mechanics.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal tanking position.
    The exact meaning of this value depends on the implementation but typically corresponds
    to a specific positioning strategy or offset from the target unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in tank AI
    code: "int position = tankStrategy.GetTankingPosition(targetUnit, true);\nif (position\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Adjust tank's position based on calculated value\n    tank->MoveTo(position);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with group tanking logic
    code: "Unit* target = GetTarget();\nbool isMainTank = IsMainTank();\nint position\
      \ = tankStrategy.GetTankingPosition(target, isMainTank);\nif (position != 0)\
      \ {\n    // Apply positioning logic for tank\n    ApplyTankPositioning(position);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI strategy system and should only be called when
    the tank unit has a valid target. The returned position value may vary based on
    the specific implementation of TankPositionStrategy and could be influenced by
    factors such as combat distance, target mobility, and group composition.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The return value should be interpreted carefully
    as its meaning depends entirely on the specific strategy implementation used.
