  signature: SpellCastResult Spell::CheckMovement() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the spell's casting movement requirements are met.
  description: This method evaluates whether the current spell's movement constraints
    are satisfied, determining if the spell can proceed with its cast based on the
    player's movement state. It typically checks for conditions such as whether the
    caster is moving during spell casting, or if movement restrictions prevent the
    spell from being cast. The method is crucial for maintaining game balance and
    preventing exploits related to movement and spell casting mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a SpellCastResult indicating whether the movement requirements
    are satisfied. Possible values include SPELL_CAST_OK, SPELL_FAILED_MOVEMENT_BLOCKED,
    or other movement-related failure codes depending on the specific spell and context.
  examples:

      \ issues\n}"
