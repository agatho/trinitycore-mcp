documentation:
  brief: Sets the bonus list IDs for an item, configuring its enchantment and set
    bonuses.
  description: This method configures the bonus list IDs for an Item object, which
    determines how the item's enchantments and set bonuses are applied. It is used
    to assign specific bonus lists that define the item's properties such as stat
    bonuses, enchantment effects, and set bonuses. The method typically requires a
    valid bonus list ID to be passed in, and it updates the internal state of the
    item accordingly. This functionality is crucial for managing item quality and
    performance in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: bonusListIDs
    description: The identifier(s) of the bonus list(s) to assign to the item. This
      parameter defines the set bonuses and enchantment effects applied to the item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetBonuses(1234);

      // Sets the bonus list ID 1234 for the item'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetBonuses(5678);

      // Assigns a specific bonus list ID to configure item''s set bonuses

      // This is typically used during item creation or when modifying item properties'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called during item initialization or modification, and
    it should only be invoked with valid bonus list IDs. The method updates the internal
    state of the item to reflect the new bonus list configuration.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect item properties, including
    missing or incorrect set bonuses and enchantments. Care must be taken to ensure
    that the bonus list ID is valid and corresponds to actual game data.
