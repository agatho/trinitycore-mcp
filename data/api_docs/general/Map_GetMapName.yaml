  signature: const char * Map::GetMapName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the map instance.
  description: The GetMapName method retrieves the human-readable name of the map
    object. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework
    to identify map instances by their name, which is essential for various game mechanics
    including quest tracking, zone identification, and player navigation. The returned
    string represents the localized name of the map as defined in the game database,
    typically corresponding to the map's entry in the `map.dbc` file or similar database
    structure.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to a null-terminated string containing the map name.
    If the map instance has no valid name, it returns nullptr. The returned string
    is managed by the map object and should not be freed by the caller.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = player->GetMap();

      const char* mapName = map->GetMapName();

      printf("Map name: %s\n", mapName);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using map name in quest system
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nconst char* mapName = map->GetMapName();\n\
      if (mapName && strcmp(mapName, \"Darnassus\") == 0) {\n    // Player is in Darnassus\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. The returned
    string is valid only during the lifetime of the map object, so it should not be
    stored or used beyond that context. Performance considerations are minimal as
    this method simply accesses a cached value.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned string in comparisons; ensure proper
    null checking to avoid crashes. Also, the name may vary depending on the locale
    settings of the server.
