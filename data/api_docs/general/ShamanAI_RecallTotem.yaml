  class: ShamanAI
  method: RecallTotem
  signature: void ShamanAI::RecallTotem(TotemType type)
documentation:
  brief: Recalls a specific totem type from the battlefield, removing it from the
    world and returning it to the shaman's control.
  description: The RecallTotem method is used by the ShamanAI class to remove a specified
    totem type from the game world. This function is typically invoked when a shaman
    needs to reclaim their totems, such as during combat or when changing positions.
    The method ensures that the totem of the given type is destroyed and its effects
    are removed from the battlefield, allowing the shaman to reposition or replace
    it with another totem if needed. It's an essential part of totem management in
    the AI behavior for shaman characters.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of totem to recall. This parameter specifies which totem
      should be removed from the battlefield, such as Fire, Earth, Water, or Air totems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Recall Fire Totem
    code: 'ShamanAI* shamanAI = ...;

      shamanAI->RecallTotem(TOTEM_TYPE_FIRE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when certain
    conditions are met, such as when a totem's duration expires or when a shaman needs
    to reposition. The actual totem removal logic may involve updating internal state
    and notifying the game world of the change.
  warnings: Ensure that the totem type passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    totem in the AI's control. Incorrect usage could lead to undefined behavior or
    inconsistent AI behavior.
