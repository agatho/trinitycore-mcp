  brief: Attempts to retrieve chase parameters from a movement request
  description: The TryGetChaseParams method is used to extract chase-related parameters
    from a MovementRequest object. This method is typically invoked when processing
    AI movement behaviors where a creature or NPC needs to pursue a target. It returns
    an integer value indicating success or failure of the parameter retrieval operation.
    The method checks if the movement request contains valid chase parameters and
    prepares them for use in pathfinding or movement logic. If successful, it allows
    the AI to determine appropriate chasing behavior such as distance thresholds,
    speed adjustments, or target tracking methods.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value where 0 typically indicates success and non-zero
    values indicate various failure conditions such as missing parameters, invalid
    data, or internal errors. The exact meaning of different return codes should be
    determined by examining the implementation or related documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement
    code: "class MyAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n        MovementRequest\
      \ request;\n        int result = request.TryGetChaseParams();\n        if (result\
      \ == 0)\n        {\n            // Successfully retrieved chase parameters\n\
      \            // Proceed with chasing logic\n        }\n        else\n      \
      \  {\n            // Handle parameter retrieval failure\n        }\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore movement system and is primarily used
    in AI implementations. The exact behavior may depend on how the MovementRequest
    was constructed and what parameters were set during its initialization. Developers
    should ensure that proper error handling is implemented for cases where parameter
    retrieval fails.
  warnings: The return value interpretation may vary depending on implementation details,
    so developers should verify the specific meaning of different return codes in
    their version of TrinityCore. Improper use of this method without checking return
    values could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect AI movement patterns.
