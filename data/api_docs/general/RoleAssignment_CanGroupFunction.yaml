  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CanGroupFunction
  signature: bool RoleAssignment::CanGroupFunction(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can perform group-related functions based on
    their role assignment.
  description: The CanGroupFunction method evaluates if a player, as defined by their
    RoleAssignment, is permitted to participate in group activities such as joining
    or creating groups. This check typically involves verifying the player's assigned
    role and ensuring it allows for group participation. The method may consider factors
    like role permissions, player status, and server configuration settings. It is
    commonly used during group operations to validate eligibility before allowing
    actions that require group membership or leadership.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's role assignment permits them to perform group
    functions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Check for Group Function
    code: "if (player->GetRoleAssignment()->CanGroupFunction(group)) {\n    // Allow\
      \ player to join or create a group\n    group->AddMember(player);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Deny access to group functions\n    player->SendNotification(\"You cannot\
      \ perform group functions.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any group-related operation to ensure
    proper role-based access control. It is assumed that the RoleAssignment object
    has been properly initialized with valid role data.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as undefined behavior may occur if it's improperly handled. Also, be aware that
    role assignments might change dynamically during gameplay, so repeated checks
    may be necessary.
