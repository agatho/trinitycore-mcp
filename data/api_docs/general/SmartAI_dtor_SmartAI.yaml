documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SmartAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The SmartAI destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    resources allocated during the lifetime of a SmartAI object. This includes releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory, unregistering the AI from game systems, and
    ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. The destructor is automatically
    called when a SmartAI object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method ensures that
    AI-controlled creatures or game objects are properly disposed of without leaving
    behind any residual state that could cause instability or memory corruption.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SmartAI instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SmartAI* ai = new SmartAI();\n    // ... use\
      \ the AI ...\n    delete ai; // Triggers ~SmartAI destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: SmartAI destruction in creature AI system
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public SmartAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyCreatureAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : SmartAI(creature) {}\n    ~MyCreatureAI() override\n    {\n  \
      \      // Custom cleanup if needed\n        // Base SmartAI destructor is called\
      \ automatically\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The SmartAI destructor should never be called directly by user code. It is
    automatically invoked during object destruction. Developers should ensure that
    all derived classes properly call the base class destructor using 'override' keyword
    to maintain proper inheritance chain execution.
  warnings: Improper handling of SmartAI objects or premature deletion of AI instances
    can lead to memory corruption or crashes, especially when dealing with creature
    AI systems that rely on proper cleanup of AI state.
