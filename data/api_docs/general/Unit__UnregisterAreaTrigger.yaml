  class: Unit
  method: _UnregisterAreaTrigger
  signature: void Unit::_UnregisterAreaTrigger(int * areaTrigger)
documentation:
  brief: Unregisters an area trigger from the unit's active triggers.
  description: This method removes a specified area trigger from the unit's list of
    registered triggers, effectively disabling the trigger's functionality. It is
    typically used during cleanup operations when a unit is no longer able to interact
    with certain area triggers or when the trigger needs to be removed from the game
    world. The method ensures that the area trigger is properly unregistered from
    the unit's internal tracking system, preventing potential memory leaks or incorrect
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTrigger
    description: Pointer to the area trigger object that should be unregistered. This
      parameter must not be null and represents a valid area trigger instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger;

      unit->_UnregisterAreaTrigger(trigger);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with cleanup
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger;

      unit->_UnregisterAreaTrigger(trigger);

      // Perform cleanup operations

      delete trigger;

      delete unit;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called only when the area trigger is no longer needed
    or when the unit is being destroyed. It is important to ensure that the area trigger
    pointer is valid and not null before calling this method. Failure to properly
    unregister an area trigger may lead to memory leaks or incorrect behavior.
  warnings: This method should not be called on a null pointer, as it will result
    in undefined behavior. Additionally, calling this method multiple times on the
    same area trigger can cause double-free errors and crashes.
