  class: AssassinationRogueRefactored
  method: ConsumeEnergy
  signature: void AssassinationRogueRefactored::ConsumeEnergy(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified amount of energy from the rogue's energy resource.
  description: The ConsumeEnergy method reduces the energy level of an Assassination
    Rogue by the given amount. This method is typically used during ability execution
    to deduct the required energy cost from the player's current energy pool. The
    energy consumption directly affects the rogue's ability to perform actions such
    as Sinister Strike, Backstab, or other energy-based abilities. If the requested
    energy amount exceeds the rogue's current energy, the method may either consume
    all remaining energy or handle the overflow based on internal game logic. This
    method is integral to the rogue's resource management system and ensures proper
    energy cost handling for combat abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of energy to be consumed from the rogue's energy pool.
      Must be a non-negative integer representing the energy cost of an ability or
      action.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Consumption
    code: 'AssassinationRogueRefactored rogue;

      // Assume rogue has 40 energy

      rogue.ConsumeEnergy(25); // Consumes 25 energy, leaving 15 energy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming All Remaining Energy
    code: 'AssassinationRogueRefactored rogue;

      // Assume rogue has 10 energy

      rogue.ConsumeEnergy(50); // Consumes all remaining 10 energy, no overflow handling
      shown'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal energy tracking system of
    the rogue class. It may trigger energy-based event callbacks or update UI elements
    to reflect the new energy level. The implementation should ensure that energy
    values do not go below zero, though exact behavior on underflow is unspecified
    without source code.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter does not exceed the rogue's current energy
    pool unless overflow handling is explicitly designed. Improper usage may lead
    to incorrect resource management or unexpected behavior in combat actions.
