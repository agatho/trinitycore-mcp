  method: IsActive
  signature: bool VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the Vengeance demon spikes effect is currently active on the
    target.
  description: The IsActive method determines if the Vengeance demon spikes aura is
    currently applied to the tracked unit. This method is typically used within the
    context of warlock vengeance talent mechanics, where demon spikes provide damage
    absorption and retaliation effects. The check evaluates the current state of the
    aura and returns true if it is active, false otherwise. This functionality is
    crucial for determining when to apply or remove related effects in the game's
    combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Vengeance demon spikes aura is currently active on
    the target unit; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (vengeanceTracker->IsActive())\n{\n    // Apply retaliation damage\n\
      \    target->DealDamage(attacker, damageAmount, NULL, DIRECT_DAMAGE, SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateVengeanceSpikes()\n{\n    if (vengeanceTracker->IsActive())\n\
      \    {\n        // Update spike damage absorption\n        uint32 absorbed =\
      \ target->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_AURA_SCHOOL_ABSORB, 0)->GetAmount();\n       \
      \ // Process retaliation logic\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Reset or\
      \ disable retaliation effects\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple aura state check and should be efficient to
    call. It relies on the underlying aura tracking system of TrinityCore, which maintains
    accurate state information for all active auras.
  warnings: Ensure that the VengeanceDemonSpikesTracker instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized tracker could lead to
    undefined behavior. The method only checks the current aura state and does not
    modify it.
