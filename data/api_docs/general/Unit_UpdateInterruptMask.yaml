  method: UpdateInterruptMask
  signature: void Unit::UpdateInterruptMask()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the interrupt mask for the unit, determining which types of interrupts
    can affect the unit's current spell or effect.
  description: The UpdateInterruptMask method recalculates and sets the interrupt
    mask for a Unit object. This mask determines what types of interrupts (such as
    movement, damage, or being attacked) can break or interrupt ongoing spells, abilities,
    or effects that the unit is currently casting or affected by. The method typically
    gets called internally when spell states or unit conditions change, ensuring that
    the interrupt behavior remains consistent with the current game state and unit
    status. It is part of the core spell and aura system in TrinityCore and directly
    affects gameplay mechanics related to spell interruption and unit responsiveness
    during combat.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within spell logic
    code: "void MySpell::OnCast()\n{\n    // ... spell initialization code ...\n \
      \   m_caster->UpdateInterruptMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage after unit status change
    code: "void Unit::SetHealth(int32 newHealth)\n{\n    // ... health update logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateInterruptMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core engine when spell
    or aura states change. Developers should not usually call it manually unless implementing
    custom interrupt logic or modifying internal behavior. The interrupt mask is used
    in conjunction with spell flags and aura effects to determine whether an interrupt
    condition is met.
  warnings: Calling this method unnecessarily may cause performance overhead as it
    recalculates all active interrupt conditions for the unit. Avoid calling it in
    tight loops or high-frequency update contexts unless absolutely required.
