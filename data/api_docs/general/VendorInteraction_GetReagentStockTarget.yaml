api:
  class: VendorInteraction
  method: GetReagentStockTarget
  signature: uint32 VendorInteraction::GetReagentStockTarget(Player * bot, uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the stock target quantity for a reagent item used in crafting by
    the specified player.
  description: The GetReagentStockTarget method determines the desired stock level
    for a specific reagent item that a player's bot intends to maintain while purchasing
    items from vendors. This value is typically used in automated vendor interaction
    logic to decide how many of a particular reagent to buy based on crafting needs
    and current inventory. The method takes into account the player's crafting profession,
    the item ID of the reagent, and potentially other factors such as the bot's configured
    stock management settings or crafting priorities. It does not directly interact
    with the vendor or modify any state; instead, it returns a calculated target quantity
    that can be used by calling code to determine purchase behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is performing
      vendor interactions. This player's crafting knowledge and stock preferences
      are considered when calculating the reagent stock target.
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the reagent item for which the stock
      target quantity is being retrieved. This ID must correspond to a valid item
      in the game database that can be used as a crafting reagent.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the target stock quantity for the specified
    reagent item. A return value of zero typically indicates that no specific stock
    target is defined or that the item should not be stocked. Higher values indicate
    how many units of the reagent the bot aims to maintain in inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 targetStock = vendorInteraction.GetReagentStockTarget(playerBot,\
      \ 12345);\nif (targetStock > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with purchasing up to 'targetStock'\
      \ units of item 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Vendor Purchase Logic
    code: "uint32 itemId = 18256; // Example reagent ID\nuint32 target = vendorInteraction.GetReagentStockTarget(playerBot,\
      \ itemId);\nuint32 currentStock = playerBot->GetItemCount(itemId);\nuint32 toBuy\
      \ = (target > currentStock) ? (target - currentStock) : 0;\nif (toBuy > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Buy 'toBuy' units of the reagent from vendor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger vendor interaction system and relies on the
    bot's crafting profession data, inventory state, and configuration settings to
    determine appropriate stock targets. The actual calculation may involve checking
    the player's professions, learned recipes, and any custom stock management rules
    defined for the bot.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter is a valid Player object and that the
    'itemId' corresponds to an existing item in the game database; otherwise, the
    behavior of this method is undefined. The returned value does not guarantee that
    the item will be available for purchase at the vendor.
