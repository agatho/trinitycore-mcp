documentation:
  brief: Sets the count value for the level bracket.
  description: The SetCount method assigns a specified count value to the LevelBracket
    instance. This method is typically used in the context of managing player level
    brackets, such as those used in loot distribution systems or level-based reward
    calculations within TrinityCore. The 'const' qualifier on the method suggests
    that it does not modify the object's state but may be modifying internal data
    structures or flags related to the count. It is important to note that this method
    might be part of a larger system where level brackets define ranges of player
    levels and associated properties like loot counts or reward tiers.

  - title: Setting Level Bracket Count
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket;

      bracket.SetCount(5);

      // Sets the count of the level bracket to 5, possibly indicating 5 items in
      a loot group for this level range.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is marked as const, which implies that it should not alter the
    object's state. However, internal member variables or flags might still be modified.
    Developers should verify whether this method affects any cached values or requires
    synchronization if used in multi-threaded environments.
