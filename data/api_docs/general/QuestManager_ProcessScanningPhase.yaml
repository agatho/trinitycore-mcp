  signature: void QuestManager::ProcessScanningPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the scanning phase for active quests in the player's quest log
  description: The ProcessScanningPhase method iterates through all active quests
    assigned to a player and performs various checks and updates related to quest
    progress, objective tracking, and state transitions. This method is typically
    invoked during periodic quest update cycles or when specific game events occur
    that require quest status verification. It handles scanning for quest objectives
    such as item collection, creature kills, and location-based triggers, updating
    quest data accordingly. The method ensures that quest states remain synchronized
    with the current game world conditions and player actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Update Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateQuests()\n{\n    m_questManager->ProcessScanningPhase();\n\
      \    // Other quest update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Event System
    code: "void GameEventMgr::UpdateQuestsForEvent(uint32 event_id)\n{\n    for (auto&\
      \ player : m_activePlayers)\n    {\n        if (player->HasQuest(event_id))\n\
      \        {\n            player->GetQuestManager()->ProcessScanningPhase();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the player's periodic update cycle
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom quest
    logic. The scanning process may involve database operations and can impact performance
    if a large number of active quests exist. It's recommended to call this method
    during low-traffic periods or when quest updates are needed.
  warnings: Avoid calling ProcessScanningPhase directly from high-frequency update
    loops as it may cause performance degradation. Ensure that all quest-related data
    is properly initialized before invoking this method, especially in scenarios involving
    quest loading from database.
