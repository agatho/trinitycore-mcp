api:
  class: BotPopulationManager
  method: AddBotToZone
  signature: void BotPopulationManager::AddBotToZone(uint32 zoneId, int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a bot to the specified zone with the given GUID.
  description: The AddBotToZone method is responsible for registering a bot with a
    specific zone in the TrinityCore framework. This function likely updates internal
    data structures or databases to track which bots are present in which zones, enabling
    proper bot behavior and management within the game world. The method accepts a
    zone identifier and a bot's unique global identifier (GUID) to associate the bot
    with that particular zone. It is typically used during bot initialization or when
    moving bots between zones to ensure accurate tracking and proper execution of
    zone-specific behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the zone where the bot should be added.
      This value corresponds to a specific area in the game world, such as a city,
      dungeon, or outdoor region.
  - name: botGuid
    description: The global unique identifier of the bot being added to the zone.
      This is used to distinguish one bot from another and is typically generated
      during bot creation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotPopulationManager::AddBotToZone(1234, 56789);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Bots to Same Zone
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    BotPopulationManager::AddBotToZone(1234,\
      \ 56789 + i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot management system and may interact
    with other systems such as AI behavior trees or zone-specific event handlers.
    It's important to ensure that the zoneId corresponds to an actual existing zone
    in the game world, otherwise the operation might fail silently or cause undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing invalid zone IDs or bot GUIDs could lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors in the bot management system. Ensure that all parameters are validated
    before calling this method.
