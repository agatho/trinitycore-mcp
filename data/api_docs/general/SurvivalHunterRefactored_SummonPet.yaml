  brief: Summons the hunter's pet into the world
  description: The SummonPet method is responsible for bringing a hunter's pet into
    existence within the game world. This method typically handles the creation of
    the pet object, its placement in the world, and the necessary client updates to
    display the pet to the player. It may also manage the pet's initial stats, behavior,
    and relationship with the hunter. The method is commonly invoked when a hunter
    uses a pet summoning spell or ability, or when the pet needs to be respawned after
    being dismissed or killed.

    code: "void MyHunterAI::OnPlayerEnterCombat()\n{\n    m_hunter->SummonPet();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI system and may trigger events
    related to pet summoning. It should only be called when the hunter has a valid
    pet that can be summoned, otherwise it may result in undefined behavior or errors.
