documentation:
  brief: Updates the defensive abilities and states of the feral druid character.
  description: The UpdateDefensives method manages the internal state and application
    of defensive abilities for a feral druid class instance. This includes updating
    cooldowns, checking mana requirements, and applying any defensive buffs or auras
    that are active or available. The method ensures that the druid's defensive capabilities
    are properly synchronized with the current game state, including handling transitions
    between different defensive stances or forms such as Bear Form or Cat Form. It
    typically gets called during combat updates or when defensive abilities are triggered
    by player actions or game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void FeralDruidAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update\
      \ logic ...\n    UpdateDefensives();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the AI update cycle and should
    not be called directly unless specifically required for custom behavior. It may
    perform checks against player resources like mana or rage, so ensure the character
    state is valid before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the intended update context might lead
    to inconsistent defensive states or incorrect ability usage. Ensure that all preconditions
    for defensive abilities (such as form requirements) are met before invoking this
    method.
