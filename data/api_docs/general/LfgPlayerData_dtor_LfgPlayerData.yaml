documentation:
  brief: Destroys an instance of LfgPlayerData, releasing all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the LfgPlayerData class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the lifetime
    of the object. This method is automatically invoked when an instance of LfgPlayerData
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG
    (Looking for Group) system, this destructor ensures proper cleanup of player-specific
    LFG data such as queued groups, roles, and state information. It is important
    that this destructor be called to prevent memory leaks within the LFG subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of LfgPlayerData
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    LfgPlayerData data;\n    // ... use data ...\n\
      } // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object goes
    out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor
    unless performing low-level memory management. The LfgPlayerData class likely
    manages internal containers or pointers that require proper cleanup during destruction.
