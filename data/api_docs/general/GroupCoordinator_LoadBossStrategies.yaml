documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads boss encounter strategies for group coordination in
    World of Warcraft instances.
  description: The LoadBossStrategies method is responsible for loading and initializing
    all encounter-specific strategies that are used by the GroupCoordinator to manage
    boss fights within World of Warcraft instances. This method typically reads configuration
    data from database tables or configuration files, setting up the necessary behavior
    patterns for different boss encounters. It ensures that each boss encounter has
    appropriate AI logic, timing mechanisms, and coordination rules that align with
    the intended difficulty and gameplay experience. The method is usually invoked
    during instance initialization or when a new group enters a boss encounter area.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Initialization
    code: "void InstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup())\n    {\n        GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator(group);\n\
      \        if (coordinator)\n        {\n            coordinator->LoadBossStrategies();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during instance setup and should only be
    invoked once per group encounter. It may involve database queries or file I/O
    operations, so performance considerations should be taken into account for frequently
    accessed instances. The method assumes that the GroupCoordinator has been properly
    initialized with valid group data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same coordinator without proper
    cleanup can lead to duplicate strategy registrations. Ensure that any existing
    strategies are cleared before reloading to prevent memory leaks or unexpected
    behavior during boss encounters.
