  method: GetTBBVersion
  signature: std::string DependencyValidator::GetTBBVersion()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the version string of the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
    library used by TrinityCore.
  description: The GetTBBVersion method returns a std::string containing the version
    identifier of the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library that is currently
    linked with the TrinityCore server. This method is typically used for debugging,
    compatibility checking, or logging purposes to ensure that the correct version
    of TBB is being utilized. The returned string usually follows a standard versioning
    format such as '2021.10.0' or similar. This functionality is part of the DependencyValidator
    class which helps in verifying and reporting the versions of external dependencies
    used by the core server components.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string representing the version of the Intel Threading Building
    Blocks (TBB) library currently in use. The format typically follows semantic versioning
    conventions like '2021.10.0'. Returns an empty string if the TBB version cannot
    be determined or if TBB is not being used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Log TBB Version
    code: 'DependencyValidator validator;

      std::string tbbVersion = validator.GetTBBVersion();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, "Using Intel TBB version: %s", tbbVersion.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal diagnostics and should not
    be relied upon for runtime logic. The actual version string returned depends on
    how the TrinityCore build system links against the TBB library at compile time.
    If TBB is not used or not properly linked, an empty string may be returned.
