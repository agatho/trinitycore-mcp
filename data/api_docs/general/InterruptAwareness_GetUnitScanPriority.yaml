  method: GetUnitScanPriority
  signature: uint32 InterruptAwareness::GetUnitScanPriority(Unit * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the scan priority value for a specified unit within the interrupt
    awareness system.
  description: The GetUnitScanPriority method determines and returns a numerical priority
    level assigned to a given Unit object. This priority is used by the interrupt
    awareness system to prioritize which units should be scanned or evaluated first
    during interrupt-related checks, such as detecting when an enemy's spell casting
    might be interrupted. The returned value typically reflects factors like threat
    level, unit type, or proximity to the player. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the scan priority of the specified unit. Higher
    values indicate higher priority for scanning. The exact interpretation of these
    values depends on the implementation logic within the interrupt awareness system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nuint32 priority = interruptAwareness.GetUnitScanPriority(target);\n\
      // Use priority value to determine scanning behavior\nif (priority > 1000)\n\
      {\n    // High-priority unit, process immediately\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the interrupt awareness system and likely used in
    AI decision-making processes. It may be called frequently during combat updates,
    so performance should be considered for high-frequency calls.
