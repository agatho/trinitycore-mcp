api:
  class: BlackMarketEntry
  method: Update
  signature: void BlackMarketEntry::Update(time_t newTimeOfUpdate)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the black market entry's state and timer based on the provided time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for refreshing the internal state
    of a BlackMarketEntry object, typically used to synchronize its expiration timer
    or refresh its availability status. This method is commonly invoked during game
    ticks or when a player interacts with the black market interface. It ensures that
    the entry's data remains consistent with the current game time and reflects any
    changes in availability or duration. The method likely updates internal timers,
    checks for expiration conditions, and may trigger related events or notifications
    if the entry's state has changed.
  parameters:
  - name: newTimeOfUpdate
    description: The new timestamp that represents the current game time to which
      the black market entry should be updated. This value is typically obtained from
      the game's global time system and is used to calculate elapsed time since the
      last update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Usage
    code: 'BlackMarketEntry entry;

      // Assume entry was previously initialized

      entry.Update(time(nullptr)); // Update with current game time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update During Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    for (auto& entry : blackMarketEntries)\n    {\n\
      \        entry.Update(GetGameTime());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called frequently during game updates, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account. It may internally use time comparisons
    to determine if the black market entry has expired or needs to be refreshed.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided time value is valid and represents a meaningful
    point in the game's timeline. Passing an invalid or outdated timestamp could cause
    incorrect behavior or state inconsistencies.
