  description: This method loads the player's glyph information from the database,
    including all active glyphs that have been learned. It is typically called during
    player initialization or when loading character data from the database. The method
    handles the retrieval and application of glyph data to ensure proper character
    progression and gameplay mechanics. This function is part of the internal player
    loading process and should not be called directly by external code.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadGlyphs(0);

      // This loads all glyphs for the player character'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called internally during player initialization and should
    not be invoked directly. It involves database operations that may impact performance
    if called frequently. The method handles glyph data retrieval from the database
    table containing glyph information.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause character data corruption or incorrect
    glyph application. This method should only be called during proper player loading
    sequences, not during gameplay.
