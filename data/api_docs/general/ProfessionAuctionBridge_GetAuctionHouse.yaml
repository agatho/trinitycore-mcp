  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: GetAuctionHouse
  signature: AuctionHouse * ProfessionAuctionBridge::GetAuctionHouse() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the auction house associated with the profession auction bridge.
  description: The GetAuctionHouse method returns a pointer to the AuctionHouse object
    that is linked to this ProfessionAuctionBridge instance. This method allows access
    to the auction house data and functionality for managing auctions related to professions.
    The returned pointer should be used carefully as it may be null if no auction
    house has been assigned or initialized. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this bridge typically connects profession-related auction activities with the
    core auction house system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an AuctionHouse object representing the associated auction
    house. Returns nullptr if no auction house is linked or if initialization failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ProfessionAuctionBridge* bridge = ...;\nAuctionHouse* ah = bridge->GetAuctionHouse();\n\
      if (ah != nullptr) {\n    // Use the auction house\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Auction House Data
    code: "ProfessionAuctionBridge* bridge = ...;\nAuctionHouse* ah = bridge->GetAuctionHouse();\n\
      if (ah != nullptr) {\n    uint32 auctionId = ah->GetId();\n    // Perform operations\
      \ with the auction house\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the state of
    the ProfessionAuctionBridge instance. The returned AuctionHouse pointer should
    be validated for null before use to prevent access violations. This method is
    typically used in auction-related systems where profession-specific auctions need
    to interact with the general auction house infrastructure.
  warnings: Using the returned pointer without checking for null can lead to segmentation
    faults or undefined behavior. Ensure proper initialization of the ProfessionAuctionBridge
    before calling this method, as it may return nullptr if not properly configured.
