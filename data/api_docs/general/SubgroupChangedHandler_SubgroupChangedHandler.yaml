documentation:
  brief: Initializes a subgroup changed handler for the specified BotAI instance
  description: The SubgroupChangedHandler constructor initializes a handler object
    that manages events related to subgroup changes within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    This method sets up internal state and callbacks necessary for tracking when a
    bot's subgroup membership changes, which is critical for maintaining proper group
    coordination and behavior in World of Warcraft instances. The handler typically
    registers itself with the AI system's event manager to receive notifications about
    subgroup modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: SubgroupChangedHandler handler(botAI);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a BotAI object. The handler assumes that the provided BotAI instance is valid
    and properly initialized before being passed to this constructor.
