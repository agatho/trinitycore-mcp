documentation:
  brief: Initializes the equipment priorities for shaman characters based on their
    role and combat specialization.
  description: The InitializeShamanPriorities method sets up default equipment priority
    configurations for shaman class characters within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method establishes the order in which equipment items should be evaluated and
    equipped based on shaman-specific gameplay mechanics, including elemental mastery,
    weapon preferences, and defensive capabilities. It typically runs during character
    initialization or when switching to a shaman specialization, ensuring that the
    EquipmentManager has appropriate priority rules for optimal shaman performance.
    The method does not require any input parameters and modifies internal state within
    the EquipmentManager class.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'EquipmentManager* mgr = player->GetEquipmentManager();

      mgr->InitializeShamanPriorities();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after a shaman character's specialization is
    confirmed but before any equipment evaluation occurs. The priority settings are
    typically stored in internal data structures and may be overridden by player-specific
    customization or server configuration.
