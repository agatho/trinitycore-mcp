  class: ProtectionWarriorRefactored
  method: ApplySunderArmor
  signature: void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::ApplySunderArmor(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Sunder Armor debuff to the specified target unit.
  description: The ApplySunderArmor method applies the Sunder Armor spell effect to
    a given target unit. This ability is a key part of the Protection Warrior's defensive
    and offensive toolkit, reducing the target's armor by a percentage for a set duration.
    The method likely checks for valid target conditions, applies the debuff through
    the game's spell system, and may trigger additional effects such as threat generation
    or resource gain. It is typically used in combat scenarios where the warrior needs
    to weaken an opponent's defenses to increase damage output from subsequent attacks.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that will receive the Sunder Armor debuff.
      Must be a valid target unit within combat range, and cannot be null or self.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    if (Unit* target\
      \ = GetVictim())\n    {\n        ApplySunderArmor(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with target validation
    code: "void ProtectionWarriorRefactored::ExecuteSunder()\n{\n    Unit* target\
      \ = GetTarget();\n    if (target && target->IsAlive() && !target->HasAura(SUNDER_ARMOR_AURA_ID))\n\
      \    {\n        ApplySunderArmor(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interfaces with TrinityCore's spell system and aura management.
    The actual implementation may involve checking for existing Sunder Armor effects,
    calculating damage reduction based on the warrior's level and gear, and applying
    a debuff that lasts for several seconds. Performance-wise, this should be lightweight
    as it only applies an aura to a target unit.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Calling ApplySunderArmor on invalid targets (such as self or non-combat
    units) may result in undefined behavior or server-side errors. Also, verify that
    the warrior has sufficient resource (rage) to cast Sunder Armor.
