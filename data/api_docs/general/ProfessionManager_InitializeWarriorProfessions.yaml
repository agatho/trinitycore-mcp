  brief: Initializes warrior profession data and associated skills for player characters.
  description: The InitializeWarriorProfessions method sets up all necessary profession-related
    data for warrior class characters within the TrinityCore framework. This includes
    loading base profession levels, skill points, available recipes, and any class-specific
    profession bonuses or restrictions. The method ensures that warriors can properly
    access and utilize their chosen professions from the moment they are initialized
    in the game world. It typically runs during player login or character creation
    processes to establish a consistent state for profession-related gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ProfessionManager* pm = sProfessionManager;

      pm->InitializeWarriorProfessions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session during character
    initialization. It is not thread-safe and must be executed on the main game thread
    to ensure proper synchronization with the WorldSession and Player objects.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate profession entries or inconsistent skill states. Avoid invoking it outside
    of appropriate initialization contexts such as player login or character creation
    routines.
