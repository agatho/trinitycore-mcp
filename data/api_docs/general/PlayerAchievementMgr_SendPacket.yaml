documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket containing achievement data to the player's client
  description: The SendPacket method is responsible for transmitting achievement-related
    data from the server to a specific player's client. This method is typically used
    within the PlayerAchievementMgr class to deliver achievement updates, progress
    information, or reward notifications. The method takes a const WorldPacket pointer
    as input, which contains the serialized packet data that should be sent over the
    network to the player. It operates within the context of TrinityCore's networking
    system and ensures proper delivery of achievement-related game state changes to
    the client.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A constant pointer to a WorldPacket object containing the serialized
      achievement data to be sent to the player's client. This packet should be properly
      formatted with the correct opcode and payload for achievement-related communications.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Achievement Data Packet
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_ACHIEVEMENT_DELETED, 4);

      packet << uint32(12345);

      playerAchievementMgr->SendPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Achievement Progress Update
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_UPDATE_ACCOUNT_DATA, 8);

      packet << uint32(ACCOUNT_DATA_UNK_0);

      packet << uint32(100);

      playerAchievementMgr->SendPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the PlayerAchievementMgr class
    when achievement events occur. The packet must be properly constructed with correct
    opcodes before being sent, as incorrect packet formatting may cause client-side
    errors or data corruption. The method does not perform any validation on the packet
    contents itself.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null WorldPacket pointer will likely
    result in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the packet is properly initialized
    and contains valid data before passing it to this method. This method should only
    be called from within the context of a player's session to avoid sending packets
    to disconnected clients.
