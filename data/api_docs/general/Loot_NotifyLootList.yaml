documentation:
  brief: Sends loot list notifications to players in the specified map.
  description: The NotifyLootList method broadcasts loot information to all players
    within a given map. This method is typically invoked when a creature or object
    has been looted, ensuring that nearby players are informed about available loot
    items. It handles the communication of loot data through network packets to maintain
    synchronization between server and client states. The method operates on the provided
    map context and does not return any value.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object where the loot list notification should
      be sent. This parameter defines the scope of players who will receive the notification.
  returns: null

    code: "void Creature::OnLootRemoved()\n{\n    if (m_loot)\n        m_loot->NotifyLootList(GetMap());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot system's internal mechanics and should be
    called after loot has been generated or modified. It relies on the map's player
    tracking functionality to determine which players need to receive the notification.
