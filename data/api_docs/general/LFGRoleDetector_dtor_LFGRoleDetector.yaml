  method: ~LFGRoleDetector
  signature: void LFGRoleDetector::~LFGRoleDetector()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys an LFGRoleDetector instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~LFGRoleDetector destructor is responsible for cleaning up the
    LFGRoleDetector object when it goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This
    method ensures that any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures,
    or references held by the LFGRoleDetector are properly released. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class likely manages role detection logic
    for Looking For Group (LFG) systems, where players' roles (tank, healer, damage
    dealer) are determined and tracked. The destructor guarantees proper cleanup to
    prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability during LFG operations.

  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector* detector = new LFGRoleDetector();

      // ... use the detector ...

      delete detector; // Triggers ~LFGRoleDetector()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destruction
    code: "void someFunction()\n{\n    LFGRoleDetector detector;\n    // ... use detector\
      \ ...\n} // ~LFGRoleDetector() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references
    to the LFGRoleDetector after deletion, as accessing freed memory can lead to undefined
    behavior. The destruction process should be fast and not block other operations.
