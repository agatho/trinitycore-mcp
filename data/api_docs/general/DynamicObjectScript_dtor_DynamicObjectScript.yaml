  signature: void DynamicObjectScript::~DynamicObjectScript()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DynamicObjectScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~DynamicObjectScript destructor is automatically invoked when a
    DynamicObjectScript object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method
    ensures proper cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by
    the script instance. In the context of TrinityCore's scripting system, this destructor
    plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining stable server
    performance during dynamic object lifecycle management. The destructor does not
    take any parameters and performs no explicit actions beyond standard C++ object
    destruction behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'DynamicObjectScript* script = new DynamicObjectScript();

      // ... perform operations with the script ...

      delete script; // Triggers ~DynamicObjectScript()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction in Scope
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    DynamicObjectScript script;\n    // ... use\
      \ script ...\n} // ~DynamicObjectScript() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, meaning it's designed to be overridden in derived
    classes. The destructor should not throw exceptions as it's called during object
    destruction. It's important to ensure that any derived class destructors properly
    call the base class destructor using 'virtual ~DynamicObjectScript()' syntax.
