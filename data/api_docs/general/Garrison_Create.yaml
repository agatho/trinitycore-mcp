  class: Garrison
  method: Create
  signature: bool Garrison::Create(uint32 garrSiteId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new garrison for the player using the specified garrison site identifier.
  description: The Create method initializes a new garrison instance for the player
    character. It requires a valid garrison site ID to determine the type and properties
    of the garrison being created. This method typically gets invoked during the player's
    initial garrison setup or when unlocking a new garrison location. The operation
    will fail if the specified garrSiteId is invalid or if the player already has
    an existing garrison. Upon successful creation, the garrison becomes available
    for further customization and building placement.
  parameters:
  - name: garrSiteId
    description: Unique identifier for the garrison site type. This value determines
      the garrison's faction, size, and available building slots. Valid values are
      typically defined in the game's database and correspond to specific garrison
      types like Alliance or Horde starting locations.
  returns: Returns true if the garrison was successfully created for the player; otherwise
    returns false. The method will return false if the garrSiteId is invalid, the
    player already has a garrison, or if there are insufficient resources to create
    the garrison.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Garrison Creation
    code: "Garrison* garr = new Garrison();\nuint32 siteId = 1234; // Example valid\
      \ garrison site ID\nif (garr->Create(siteId)) {\n    // Garrison successfully\
      \ created\n    printf(\"Garrison created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Failed to create garrison\n    printf(\"Failed to create garrison\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player character. Subsequent calls
    with the same or different site IDs will likely fail unless the existing garrison
    is properly removed first. The method may perform database operations to store
    the new garrison data and initialize default structures.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the player does not already
    have a garrison, as attempting to create multiple garrisons can lead to undefined
    behavior or data corruption. Ensure the garrSiteId parameter is validated against
    known valid values from the game's database.
