  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandleOffensiveCooldowns(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles offensive cooldowns for the shaman AI, determining if an offensive
    spell can be cast based on cooldown status and target validity.
  description: The HandleOffensiveCooldowns method in the ShamanAI class is responsible
    for managing the casting logic of offensive spells by checking whether cooldowns
    have expired and if a valid target exists. This method evaluates the current state
    of the shaman's offensive abilities, ensuring that spells are only cast when appropriate
    according to game mechanics and AI behavior rules. It typically integrates with
    the broader AI decision-making system to prioritize spell usage during combat
    encounters. The method returns true if an offensive ability was successfully handled
    or queued for casting; otherwise, it returns false, indicating no suitable action
    was taken.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if an offensive cooldown was handled and a spell was either
    cast or scheduled for casting. Returns false if no valid offensive action could
    be performed due to cooldowns, invalid targets, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandleOffensiveCooldowns(&targetId)) {\n    // Offensive\
      \ spell was handled\n} else {\n    // No offensive action taken\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core combat AI logic and should be called regularly
    during the AI update cycle. It assumes that the target has already been validated
    and is within range. The method may modify internal state variables related to
    spell casting timers.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer or ID passed into this method is valid
    before calling, as invalid targets can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
    This function does not perform target validation internally.
