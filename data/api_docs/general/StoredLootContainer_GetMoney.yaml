  class: StoredLootContainer
  method: GetMoney
  signature: uint32 StoredLootContainer::GetMoney() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the amount of money contained within the stored loot container.
  description: The GetMoney method returns the total amount of copper coins stored
    in a loot container. This value represents the monetary component of the loot,
    separate from item drops. The method is typically used during loot distribution
    to determine how much gold should be awarded to players. It's important to note
    that this method only retrieves the monetary value and does not affect the actual
    distribution or removal of money from the container. The returned value is expressed
    in copper units, which is the base currency unit in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total amount of money (in copper) contained
    within the stored loot container. Returns 0 if no money is present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Loot Money
    code: "uint32 money = storedLootContainer->GetMoney();\nif (money > 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Distribute money to players\n    // ... loot distribution logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Money Value in Loot Distribution
    code: "uint32 money = storedLootContainer->GetMoney();\nPlayer* player = session->GetPlayer();\n\
      if (money > 0)\n{\n    player->ModifyMoney(money);\n    // Send loot money update\
      \ to client\n    WorldPacket data(SMSG_LOOT_MONEY_NOTIFY, 4);\n    data << uint32(money);\n\
      \    player->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot system in TrinityCore and should be called
    after the loot container has been properly initialized. The money value returned
    is in copper units, where 100 copper equals 1 silver and 10000 copper equals 1
    gold. This method does not modify or remove the money from the container; it only
    retrieves the current value.
  warnings: Ensure that the StoredLootContainer object is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized container may lead to undefined
    behavior. The returned value should be treated as read-only and not modified directly
    through this method.
