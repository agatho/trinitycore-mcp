documentation:
  brief: Heals target to maximum health using spell effect.
  description: This method performs a healing operation that restores the target to
    their maximum health status. It is typically used in spell effects where the healing
    amount is calculated based on the target's maximum health, rather than a fixed
    value or percentage. The method ensures that the target receives full health restoration
    without any additional modifiers or calculations beyond what's specified by the
    spell effect itself.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void Spell::EffectHealMaxHealth() {\n    // Implementation in TrinityCore\n\
      \    // This method sets target's health to maximum\n    // without any additional\
      \ calculations\n    // This is typically used in healing spells\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect system and should be called only
    when the spell's effect type is set to HealMaxHealth. Implementation details include
    proper handling of target health status and ensuring no additional damage or healing
    modifiers are applied.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper context, as it
    requires specific spell effect types to function correctly. Improper usage may
    lead to incorrect healing behavior or target health issues.
