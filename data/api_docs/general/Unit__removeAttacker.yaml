  class: Unit
  method: _removeAttacker
  signature: void Unit::_removeAttacker(Unit * pAttacker)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified attacker from the unit's attacker list.
  description: This method removes a given Unit from the current unit's list of attackers.
    It is typically used during combat mechanics to ensure that an attacker is properly
    removed from the target's threat list, preventing further damage or threat generation.
    The method ensures that the attacker is no longer considered part of the unit's
    active combat state, which can affect various game mechanics such as threat management
    and combat behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: pAttacker
    description: Pointer to the Unit that should be removed from the attacker list.
      This parameter must not be null and must represent a valid unit that is currently
      attacking this unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      Unit* attacker = new Unit();


      // Add attacker to target''s list

      target->AddAttacker(attacker);


      // Remove attacker from target''s list

      target->_removeAttacker(attacker);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's combat system.
    It may be called during combat resolution or when an attacker leaves the combat
    state. The implementation ensures that the attacker is removed from the unit's
    internal list of attackers, which can affect the unit's threat generation and
    combat behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect threat management, potentially
    causing units to lose their target or generate incorrect threat levels. Care must
    be taken when removing attackers to ensure that the attacker is actually part
    of the unit's attacker list before calling this method.
