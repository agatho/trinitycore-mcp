  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: ResetCooldown
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::ResetCooldown(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the cooldown for a specified spell within the combat specialization.
  description: The ResetCooldown method clears the cooldown timer associated with
    a given spell ID for the current combat specialization. This functionality is
    typically used when a player's specialization changes or when certain game events
    require immediate availability of a spell. The method ensures that the specified
    spell becomes immediately usable by removing any existing cooldown period, regardless
    of its current state. It operates on the assumption that the spell ID corresponds
    to a valid spell within the combat specialization framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose cooldown needs to be reset.
      This must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Cooldown for a Specific Spell
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec)\n{\n    spec->ResetCooldown(12345); // Resets cooldown for spell ID\
      \ 12345\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting Multiple Spell Cooldowns
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (spec)\n{\n    std::vector<uint32> spellIds = {12345, 67890, 54321};\n   \
      \ for (uint32 id : spellIds)\n    {\n        spec->ResetCooldown(id);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal cooldown state and should only be
    called when appropriate game logic requires immediate spell availability. The
    implementation may involve synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the spell ID is valid or relevant
    to the current specialization can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, resetting
    cooldowns too frequently might break game balance or cause performance issues
    if overused.
