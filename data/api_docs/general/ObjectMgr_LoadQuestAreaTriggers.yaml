  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadQuestAreaTriggers()
documentation:
  brief: Loads quest area trigger data from the database into memory for active quest
    tracking.
  description: The LoadQuestAreaTriggers method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with quest area trigger definitions stored in the game database.
    These triggers are used to detect when players enter specific zones or areas that
    are associated with active quests, enabling dynamic quest progression and objective
    updates. The method typically executes during server startup or world initialization
    to ensure all quest-related area triggers are available for runtime processing.
    It reads data from relevant database tables such as 'quest_area_trigger' or similar,
    parsing the information into internal structures for fast lookup during player
    movement events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeQuests()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadQuestAreaTriggers();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup sequence before any
    player connections are accepted. It performs database queries and populates internal
    hash maps or spatial partitioning structures for efficient area trigger lookups
    during gameplay. The method should only be invoked once during the server's lifetime,
    as it's not designed to reload data dynamically.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times during runtime as it may lead to
    duplicate entries or memory leaks in internal data structures. This method assumes
    that database connections are already established and functional.
