documentation:
  brief: Sets the tracking flag for a creature to be used in player's quest log.
  description: This method allows players to set a specific tracking flag for creatures
    that are relevant to their current questing activities. The tracking flag is used
    by the game engine to determine which creatures should be displayed in the player's
    quest log and how they should be tracked during gameplay. It typically affects
    how the player's quest log displays and updates with creature kill objectives,
    enabling players to track specific creatures for quest completion purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The tracking flag value that determines which creature to track.
      This is usually a uint32 representing a specific creature ID or type of creature
      in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Tracking Flag for Creature
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetTrackCreatureFlag(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest system mechanics
    and may require proper initialization of the player's quest log before being effective.
    The tracking flag value should be consistent with existing creature IDs or quest-related
    flags within the game.
