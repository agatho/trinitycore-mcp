  class: ShamanAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void ShamanAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the specified resource required for a Shaman spell based on the
    spell ID.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for managing the consumption
    of resources such as mana, rage, or energy when a Shaman casts a spell. This method
    determines the appropriate resource type and amount to deduct from the Shaman's
    current resource pool based on the provided spell ID. It ensures that the spell
    can only be cast if sufficient resources are available, maintaining game balance
    and proper resource management for Shaman class abilities. The method is typically
    invoked internally by the AI system before attempting to cast a spell.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. This ID determines
      which resources are consumed and how much of each resource is deducted from
      the Shaman's current pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void MyShamanAI::CastLightningBolt()\n{\n    if (m_creature->HasMana())\n\
      \    {\n        ConsumeResource(403);\n        m_creature->CastSpell(m_target,\
      \ 403, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Resource Check Before Consumption
    code: "void ShamanAI::HandleShamanSpell(int spellId)\n{\n    if (CanCastSpell(spellId))\n\
      \    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n        DoCastSpell(spellId);\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the Shaman's resource management system
    and may be called automatically by the AI framework when a spell is about to be
    cast. It's important to note that this method does not perform any validation
    on whether the spell can actually be cast; it only handles resource deduction.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without checking resource availability first
    may lead to negative resource values or undefined behavior. Always ensure sufficient
    resources are available before calling this method.
