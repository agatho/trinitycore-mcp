  signature: void LootCoordination::SetConflictResolutionMethod(uint32 groupId, const
    std::string & method)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the conflict resolution method for a specified loot group in the coordination
    system
  description: This method configures how loot conflicts are resolved within a specific
    loot group. It allows administrators or game systems to define the resolution
    strategy when multiple players compete for the same loot item. The method accepts
    a group identifier and a string-based resolution method, which typically corresponds
    to predefined conflict resolution strategies such as 'round-robin', 'master-loot',
    or 'need-before-greed'. This functionality is crucial for maintaining fair and
    consistent loot distribution in group scenarios, particularly in raid environments
    where loot coordination is essential. The change takes effect immediately for
    subsequent loot operations within that group.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the loot group for which to set the conflict
      resolution method. This typically corresponds to a group or raid instance ID.
  - name: method
    description: String representation of the conflict resolution strategy to apply.
      Valid values include 'round-robin', 'master-loot', 'need-before-greed', and
      potentially others depending on server configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Master Loot Resolution for Group
    code: LootCoordination::SetConflictResolutionMethod(12345, "master-loot");
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Need-Before-Greed for Raid Group
    code: LootCoordination::SetConflictResolutionMethod(98765, "need-before-greed");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot coordination system and should be called
    before loot distribution begins for the specified group. The method does not validate
    the provided resolution method string; invalid values may result in undefined
    behavior or default fallback mechanisms.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid groupId may lead to unexpected behavior
    or errors. Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an active loot group before
    invoking this method. The resolution method string is case-sensitive and must
    match exactly with expected values.
