  signature: void InstanceScript::UpdateLfgEncounterState(const BossInfo * bossInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the LFG encounter state for a given boss in the instance script.
  description: The UpdateLfgEncounterState method is used to notify the LFG (Looking
    for Group) system about changes in the encounter state of a specific boss within
    an instance. This method is typically called when a boss is defeated or when the
    encounter status changes, ensuring that the LFG system accurately reflects the
    progress of the group. It updates internal tracking variables and communicates
    with the LFG subsystem to maintain proper encounter state synchronization. The
    method takes a pointer to a BossInfo structure which contains information about
    the boss's current state and encounter data.
  parameters:
  - name: bossInfo
    description: Pointer to a BossInfo structure containing details about the boss
      encounter, including its current state and progress information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Boss Death Event
    code: "void BossScript::OnBossDeath()\n{\n    if (m_bossInfo)\n        m_instance->UpdateLfgEncounterState(m_bossInfo);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during valid boss encounter events to maintain
    proper LFG state synchronization. The bossInfo parameter must not be null, otherwise
    the behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null bossInfo pointer will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the boss encounter data is properly initialized
    before calling this function.
