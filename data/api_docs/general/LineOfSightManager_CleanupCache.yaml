documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached line-of-sight data from the LineOfSightManager.
  description: The CleanupCache method removes all cached line-of-sight calculations
    stored within the LineOfSightManager instance. This operation is typically invoked
    to free up memory resources or reset the internal cache state when the manager's
    data becomes stale or when transitioning between different game scenarios. The
    method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. It is generally
    used during cleanup routines, map transitions, or when memory management is a
    concern in performance-critical environments such as real-time game simulations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = new LineOfSightManager();

      // ... perform some line-of-sight calculations ...

      losManager->CleanupCache(); // Clear all cached data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully in high-frequency scenarios, as clearing
    the cache may cause performance degradation if line-of-sight checks are frequently
    required afterward. The cache is likely implemented using a hash map or similar
    structure to store computed visibility results for reuse.
