documentation:
  brief: Returns a player object by its unique identifier (GUID) from the map.
  description: The GetPlayer method retrieves a Player object from the Map class using
    a specific GUID. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to access player instances within a map's object list. The method searches
    through the map's player list and returns a pointer to the player if found, otherwise
    returning nullptr. It serves as a key interface for accessing player data during
    gameplay mechanics such as combat, questing, or interaction with NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to retrieve. This is typically
      a 32-bit integer value representing the player's ID in the game world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Player object if found, otherwise returns nullptr.
    The method may return nullptr if no player exists with the specified GUID or if
    the player is not currently loaded in the map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Player* player = map->GetPlayer(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for valid player before accessing
    code: "Player* player = map->GetPlayer(12345);\nif(player != nullptr)\n{\n   \
      \ // Player exists, proceed with operations\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Hello World!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player not found in the map\n    // Handle\
      \ accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe when used properly, but requires careful handling
    of player pointers to avoid dangling references. Performance considerations include
    checking if the player exists before accessing its data, as repeated calls may
    impact map loading times.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if the GUID does not correspond to a loaded
    player in the map, or if the player is not currently present in the map's object
    list. Common mistakes include using the returned pointer without checking for
    null before dereferencing it.
