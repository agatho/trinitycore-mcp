  method: IsBotLoading
  signature: bool BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::IsBotLoading(int playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot with the specified player GUID is currently in the loading
    process.
  description: The IsBotLoading method determines whether a specific bot, identified
    by its player GUID, is currently being loaded into the game world. This method
    is typically used to prevent duplicate loading attempts or to synchronize operations
    that depend on a bot's readiness. It checks an internal tracking structure to
    see if the given GUID is marked as being in a loading state. The method does not
    modify any data but only performs a read operation on the loading status of the
    specified bot.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose bot loading status
      is being checked. This should be a valid player GUID within the game's context.
  returns: Returns true if the bot with the specified player GUID is currently in
    the loading process; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a Bot is Loading
    code: "if (sBotWorldSessionMgrOptimized->IsBotLoading(12345)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where bot with GUID 12345 is loading\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot with\
      \ GUID 12345 is currently loading.\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with operations\
      \ assuming the bot is not loading\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot with GUID 12345\
      \ is not loading.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from internal tracking structures
    without modifying them. It should be used in scenarios where bot state synchronization
    is required, such as during login sequences or when managing bot behavior transitions.
