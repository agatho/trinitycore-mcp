  method: Hash
  signature: std::size_t AuctionsBucketKey::Hash(const AuctionsBucketKey & key)
documentation:
  brief: Computes and returns a hash value for an AuctionsBucketKey instance to support
    efficient storage and retrieval in hash-based containers.
  description: The Hash method calculates a unique hash code for a given AuctionsBucketKey
    object, which is essential for storing and retrieving auction bucket keys within
    hash tables or similar data structures. This implementation ensures that objects
    with identical properties produce the same hash value, enabling fast lookups and
    avoiding collisions where possible. The method is typically used internally by
    the auction system to manage buckets of auctions efficiently. It does not modify
    the input key and is designed to be deterministic, meaning repeated calls with
    the same key will always return the same hash value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::size_t value representing the computed hash code for the provided
    AuctionsBucketKey instance. This value can be used as a key in hash-based containers
    such as std::unordered_map or std::unordered_set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of Hash Method
    code: 'AuctionsBucketKey key;

      // Assume key is populated with relevant data

      std::size_t hash_value = AuctionsBucketKey::Hash(key);

      std::cout << "Hash value: " << hash_value << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Hash in a Hash Table Context
    code: '#include <unordered_map>

      std::unordered_map<std::size_t, AuctionsBucketKey> bucket_map;

      AuctionsBucketKey key;

      // Populate key...

      std::size_t hash = AuctionsBucketKey::Hash(key);

      bucket_map[hash] = key;

      // Later retrieve using the same hash

      auto found = bucket_map.find(hash);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is static and operates on a const reference to avoid side effects.
    It's crucial for performance that the hash function distributes keys uniformly
    across the hash space to minimize collisions. The implementation should be consistent
    with how equality is determined for AuctionsBucketKey objects to maintain correctness
    in hash-based collections.
