  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: DeterminePerformanceProfile
  signature: PerformanceProfile BotPerformanceAnalytics::DeterminePerformanceProfile(double
    score)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns a performance profile based on a given score value.
  description: The DeterminePerformanceProfile method evaluates a provided double-precision
    floating-point score and maps it to a predefined PerformanceProfile enum value.
    This function is typically used within the context of bot behavior analysis or
    performance monitoring systems in TrinityCore. The method does not take any parameters
    directly but relies on an internal score value that may be set elsewhere in the
    class or system. It performs a lookup or calculation based on thresholds defined
    for different performance levels such as 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Average', 'Poor',
    etc. The result is a standardized profile that can be used to categorize bot performance
    for reporting, optimization, or gameplay balancing purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A PerformanceProfile enum value representing the categorized performance
    level based on the internal score. Possible return values include but are not
    limited to: PERFORMANCE_EXCELLENT, PERFORMANCE_GOOD, PERFORMANCE_AVERAGE, PERFORMANCE_POOR,
    and PERFORMANCE_FAIL. The exact enumeration values depend on the implementation
    of the PerformanceProfile enum in the codebase.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      // Assuming a score is available from some source

      double botScore = 87.5;

      PerformanceProfile profile = analytics.DeterminePerformanceProfile(botScore);

      // Use the profile for further processing or reporting'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the score passed to it is within a valid range,
    typically between 0.0 and 100.0. If scores outside this range are provided, behavior
    may be undefined unless explicitly handled by the internal implementation. The
    thresholds for determining performance levels should be consistent with the game's
    balancing requirements and may be configurable via configuration files or constants.
  warnings: Ensure that the score value passed to this method is valid and within
    expected bounds to avoid unexpected behavior. If the method relies on an internal
    state or variable, calling it without proper initialization might lead to incorrect
    results.
