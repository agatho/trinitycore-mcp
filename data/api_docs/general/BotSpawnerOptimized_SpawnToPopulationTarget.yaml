documentation:
  brief: Spawns bots to meet the configured population target for the bot spawner.
  description: The SpawnToPopulationTarget method is responsible for managing the
    bot population within a specific spawner instance. It evaluates the current number
    of active bots against the desired population target and spawns additional bots
    as needed to reach that target. This method typically operates within the context
    of a bot AI system where bots are dynamically created or destroyed based on server
    load, player activity, or predefined spawn rules. The method ensures that the
    number of spawned bots remains consistent with the configured target population
    without exceeding any defined limits.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;

      spawner.SpawnToPopulationTarget();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database operations to track bot states and should
    be called periodically or in response to events that affect the desired population.
    The actual spawning behavior depends on the underlying implementation of bot creation
    logic, which might include AI initialization, position placement, and faction
    assignment.
