  method: ~BotLevelDistribution
  signature: void BotLevelDistribution::~BotLevelDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotLevelDistribution instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotLevelDistribution class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of BotLevelDistribution goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In
    the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this class likely manages how bot levels
    are distributed across different difficulty tiers or player levels, and its destructor
    handles cleanup of internal data structures such as level mappings, probability
    tables, or cached distributions. The destructor does not take any parameters and
    performs no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotLevelDistribution object
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    BotLevelDistribution distribution;\n    //\
      \ Use distribution...\n    // At end of scope, destructor is automatically called\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotLevelDistribution pointer
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution* distPtr = new BotLevelDistribution();

      // Use distPtr...

      delete distPtr; // Triggers destructor

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when objects go out of scope or are deleted.
    Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless performing low-level
    memory management. The class likely contains internal data structures that require
    proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
