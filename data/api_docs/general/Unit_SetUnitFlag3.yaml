documentation:
  brief: Sets the UnitFlags3 value for a unit, enabling specific game mechanics behaviors.
  description: This method allows developers to set the UnitFlags3 flags for a Unit
    object, which controls various gameplay behaviors and states. The flags determine
    how the unit interacts with the game world, including whether it's selectable,
    attackable, or has special abilities. This method is commonly used in custom scripts
    and AI implementations to modify unit behavior dynamically during runtime. It
    should be used carefully as it affects core game mechanics such as player vs.
    player combat and NPC behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = new Unit;\n target->SetUnitFlag3(UnitFlags3::UNIT_FLAG_IN_COMBAT);\n\
      \ // This sets the unit to be in combat state"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the internal flags of a Unit object. It is important
    to understand that this change affects how the game engine handles the unit's
    behavior, particularly in relation to combat and interaction. This method should
    not be used lightly as it can impact core gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Using this method incorrectly may lead to unexpected behavior in combat
    or interaction with other units. It is recommended to use this method only when
    necessary and with proper understanding of the flag values being set.
