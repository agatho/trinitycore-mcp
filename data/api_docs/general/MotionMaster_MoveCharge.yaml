  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveCharge
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveCharge(const PathGenerator & path, float speed,
    const Unit * target, const Movement::SpellEffectExtraData * spellEffectExtraData)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a charge movement toward a target using a specified path and speed.
  description: The MoveCharge method initiates a charge movement for a unit, moving
    it along a predefined path toward a target at a given speed. This method is typically
    used in AI behavior to execute charged attacks or movement patterns where the
    unit moves directly toward a destination with acceleration. The path parameter
    defines the trajectory, while the speed controls how fast the unit travels along
    that path. An optional spell effect data can be provided for additional context
    during the movement execution. This method integrates with TrinityCore's movement
    system and is commonly used in creature AI or spell effects requiring directed
    motion.
  parameters:
  - name: path
    description: A PathGenerator object that defines the trajectory and waypoints
      for the charge movement.
  - name: speed
    description: The speed at which the unit will move along the path, in yards per
      second.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that the motion is directed toward. Can
      be null if not applicable.
  - name: spellEffectExtraData
    description: Optional pointer to spell effect extra data, used for additional
      context during movement execution. Can be null.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Charge Movement
    code: 'Unit* target = ...;

      float speed = 10.0f;

      PathGenerator path;

      path.CalculatePath(target->GetPositionX(), target->GetPositionY(), target->GetPositionZ());

      me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveCharge(path, speed, target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Charge with Spell Effect Data
    code: 'Unit* target = ...;

      float speed = 15.0f;

      PathGenerator path;

      path.CalculatePath(target->GetPositionX(), target->GetPositionY(), target->GetPositionZ());

      Movement::SpellEffectExtraData extraData;

      extraData.SetSpellId(12345);

      me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveCharge(path, speed, target, &extraData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MotionMaster's movement system and should only
    be called on units that support dynamic movement. The path must be valid and pre-calculated
    before calling this function. Charge movements are typically used for aggressive
    behaviors or spell effects requiring rapid movement toward a target.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided path is valid and does not lead to invalid positions.
    Passing null for target may cause unexpected behavior depending on implementation
    details of the movement handler. Avoid calling this method in high-frequency loops
    without proper checks to prevent performance degradation.
