  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FarmingZoneInfo class with default values.
  description: The FarmingZoneInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the FarmingZoneInfo
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the object, typically initializing
    member variables to their default values or null states. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this class likely represents information about a farming
    zone, such as crop types, growth rates, or resource availability. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized
    before the object is used in gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new FarmingZoneInfo instance
    code: 'FarmingZoneInfo zoneInfo;

      // The zoneInfo object is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when declaring a FarmingZoneInfo
    variable on the stack. Developers should be aware that the object's state may
    need to be further configured after construction depending on the specific farming
    zone being represented.
