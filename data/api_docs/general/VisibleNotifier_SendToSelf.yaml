  brief: Sends visibility updates to the player's own character
  description: The SendToSelf method is responsible for processing and sending visibility
    notifications to a player's own character within the TrinityCore world system.
    This method ensures that the player's character receives updates about objects
    and entities in their vicinity, including creatures, game objects, and other players.
    It typically handles the internal logic of updating the player's visible set and
    dispatching the appropriate packets to the client. The method is part of the VisibleNotifier
    class which manages visibility state changes for world objects.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in visibility update context
    code: 'VisibleNotifier notifier;

      notifier.SendToSelf();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core visibility system
    when a player's view changes. Developers should not normally call this directly
    unless implementing custom visibility logic. The method may trigger internal packet
    sending operations that could impact performance if called excessively.
