documentation:
  brief: Optimizes soul shard usage for the warlock AI by determining the most efficient
    spell to cast based on available soul shards and current combat state.
  description: The OptimizeSoulShardUsage method is responsible for calculating and
    selecting the optimal spell to cast when the warlock AI has available soul shards.
    This method evaluates the current combat situation, including target health, available
    mana, and the warlock's current spell rotation, to determine whether to use a
    soul shard for a specific spell such as Shadow Bolt, Incinerate, or other soul
    shard-consuming abilities. The method ensures that soul shards are used efficiently
    to maximize damage output while maintaining proper resource management. It considers
    factors like spell cooldowns, target vulnerability, and the warlock's current
    resource pool to make intelligent decisions about when and how to spend soul shards.

  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    if (HasSoulShards())\n    {\n        OptimizeSoulShardUsage();\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle when soul shards
    are available. It assumes that the warlock has at least one soul shard and that
    the target is valid for spell casting. The optimization logic may vary based on
    the specific warlock specialization (Affliction, Demonology, Destruction) and
    current encounter mechanics.
  warnings: This method should not be called when the warlock is in an invalid state
    (e.g., dead, stunned, or silenced), as it may lead to incorrect spell selection.
    Additionally, calling this method without checking for available soul shards could
    result in unintended behavior if the AI attempts to cast spells that require soul
    shards but none are present.
