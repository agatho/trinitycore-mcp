  class: Quest
  method: SetSpecialFlag
  signature: void Quest::SetSpecialFlag(QuestSpecialFlags flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a special flag for the quest to modify its behavior or tracking status.
  description: The SetSpecialFlag method allows developers to assign specific flags
    to quests that control various aspects of quest behavior, such as whether the
    quest is flagged as daily, repeatable, or requires specific conditions. This method
    is used primarily in quest scripts and event handling to ensure proper quest progression
    and completion. The flag parameter determines how the quest behaves within the
    game mechanics, particularly in relation to player tracking, quest completion,
    and reward distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The QuestSpecialFlags enum value that defines the special behavior
      of the quest. This can include flags like QUEST_SPECIAL_FLAG daily, repeatable,
      or other game-specific behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Daily Quest Flag
    code: 'Quest* quest = sObjectAccessor->GetQuest(12345);

      quest->SetSpecialFlag(QUEST_SPECIAL_FLAG_DAILY);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Repeatable Quest Flag
    code: 'Quest* quest = sObjectAccessor->GetQuest(12345);

      quest->SetSpecialFlag(QUEST_SPECIAL_FLAG_REPEATABLE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects how the quest is tracked
    and completed. It's recommended to use this method in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods to ensure proper quest progression. The flag value must be valid and match
    the expected enum values for the game mechanics to work correctly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to quests not completing properly
    or being flagged incorrectly, which may result in players not receiving rewards
    or experiencing issues with quest tracking.
