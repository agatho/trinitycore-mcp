  class: Player
  method: SetSelection
  signature: void Player::SetSelection(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the selection of the player to a specified GUID.
  description: This method assigns a specific GUID to the player's selection, allowing
    the player to target and interact with objects or entities in the game world.
    It is commonly used during quest interactions, combat scenarios, or when manipulating
    the player's target selection for various gameplay mechanics. The method ensures
    that the player's current selection matches the provided GUID, effectively updating
    the player's target state.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the object to be selected by the
      player. This value must represent a valid game object such as a creature or
      player, and should not be zero unless explicitly intended for clearing selection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Selection Setting
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSelection(12345);

      // Player now targets object with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Selection
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSelection(0);

      // Player clears selection, targeting no object'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other target-related methods
    such as SetTarget or SetSelection. It should be called carefully during gameplay
    events to avoid unintended selection changes. The method may trigger updates to
    the player's UI and game state, particularly when changing targets.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect targeting behavior,
    especially if the GUID provided does not correspond to a valid game object. Avoid
    calling this method in rapid succession without checking the validity of the GUID,
    as it may cause performance issues or unexpected game behavior.
