  method: GetNavMeshQuery
  signature: const dtNavMeshQuery * NavMeshInterface::GetNavMeshQuery(Map * map) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the navigation mesh query object for the specified map.
  description: The GetNavMeshQuery method returns a constant pointer to the Detour
    navigation mesh query object associated with the given Map instance. This query
    object is used for pathfinding and navigation calculations within the game world.
    The method ensures that each map has a unique navigation mesh query instance,
    which is essential for accurate AI movement and player navigation. The returned
    pointer should not be modified or deleted by the caller as it's managed internally
    by the NavMeshInterface.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the dtNavMeshQuery object associated with the specified
    map. Returns nullptr if the map does not have a valid navigation mesh query or
    if the input map parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Map* map = ...; // Assume map is initialized\nconst dtNavMeshQuery* navQuery\
      \ = NavMeshInterface::GetNavMeshQuery(map);\nif (navQuery)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ navigation mesh query for pathfinding\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding with Query
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nconst dtNavMeshQuery* navQuery = NavMeshInterface::GetNavMeshQuery(map);\n\
      if (navQuery)\n{\n    float start[3] = { player->GetPositionX(), player->GetPositionY(),\
      \ player->GetPositionZ() };\n    float end[3] = { targetX, targetY, targetZ\
      \ };\n    // Perform pathfinding using navQuery\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads simultaneously.
    The returned dtNavMeshQuery object is managed by the NavMeshInterface and should
    not be deleted or modified by external code. Each Map instance maintains its own
    navigation mesh query, which is created on-demand when first accessed.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the map or the
    NavMeshInterface. If the map is destroyed or the navigation mesh is rebuilt, the
    returned pointer may become invalid. Always check for null returns before using
    the query object.
