  method: GetSummonedBattlePet
  signature: Creature * Player::GetSummonedBattlePet() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the summoned battle pet creature associated with the player.
  description: This method retrieves the Creature object representing the player's
    summoned battle pet. It is used to access the battle pet that has been summoned
    by the player, typically through a pet summoning spell or ability. The returned
    creature represents the actual battle pet entity in the game world, which can
    be manipulated or queried for various properties such as health, level, and other
    battle pet specific attributes. This method is commonly used in battle pet related
    gameplay mechanics and scripts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Creature object representing the summoned battle
    pet. If no battle pet is currently summoned, this will return nullptr. The returned
    creature can be used to access battle pet specific properties and behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Creature* battlePet = player->GetSummonedBattlePet();\nif (battlePet !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Use battlePet\n    uint32 health = battlePet->GetHealth();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other battle pet related
    functions. The returned Creature object may be null if no battle pet is currently
    summoned, which can happen when the player has not yet summoned a battle pet or
    when the battle pet has been dismissed. Implementation details include checking
    for valid battle pet summoning state and ensuring proper handling of nullptr return
    values.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return nullptr if
    no battle pet is currently summoned. This can lead to null pointer dereference
    errors if not properly handled in code. Also, the returned creature object should
    only be used for battle pet specific properties and not general creature functionality.
