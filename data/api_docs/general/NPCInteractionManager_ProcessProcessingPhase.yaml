  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: ProcessProcessingPhase
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::ProcessProcessingPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the current NPC interaction phase for all active interactions.
  description: The ProcessProcessingPhase method handles the core logic of managing
    ongoing NPC interactions within the TrinityCore framework. It iterates through
    all currently active NPC interactions, updating their states, processing queued
    actions, and ensuring proper synchronization between the game world and player
    interactions. This method is typically invoked during the game's update cycle
    to maintain real-time interaction states with NPCs. The method ensures that all
    pending interaction events are properly handled and that the interaction state
    remains consistent across multiple game ticks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Update Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n\
      \    sNPCInteractionManager->ProcessProcessingPhase();\n    // Other update\
      \ logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from the main game thread to ensure thread
    safety. It performs operations on active interactions that may modify player state,
    so calling it outside of the main update loop could lead to inconsistent interaction
    states.
  warnings: Calling this method during critical sections where NPC interactions are
    being modified concurrently can cause race conditions. Always ensure proper locking
    mechanisms are in place when modifying interaction data outside of this method's
    execution.
