documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a CriteriaMgr object to another CriteriaMgr instance.
  description: The CriteriaMgr move constructor transfers all resources and state
    from the source CriteriaMgr object to the target object. This operation is typically
    used when transferring ownership of criteria-related data structures, such as
    achievement criteria or quest criteria, between objects without copying the underlying
    data. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation and should not
    be used. This constructor is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for
    the CriteriaMgr class, enabling efficient resource management in scenarios involving
    temporary objects or object transfers within the TrinityCore framework's achievement
    and quest systems.

  - title: Moving CriteriaMgr to New Instance
    code: 'CriteriaMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with criteria data ...

      CriteriaMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor called

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This move constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no
    user-defined move constructor exists. It performs a member-wise move of all data
    members, which is efficient for objects containing standard library containers
    or smart pointers. The CriteriaMgr class likely manages collections of criteria
    data that benefit from move semantics to avoid expensive deep copying operations.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source object should not be accessed
    or used in any way, as its state becomes undefined. This is a fundamental rule
    of move semantics - the moved-from object must be left in a valid but unspecified
    state.
