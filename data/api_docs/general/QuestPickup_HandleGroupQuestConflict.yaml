  class: QuestPickup
  method: HandleGroupQuestConflict
  signature: void QuestPickup::HandleGroupQuestConflict(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles quest conflict resolution within a group when multiple members attempt
    to pick up the same quest.
  description: The HandleGroupQuestConflict method manages scenarios in World of Warcraft
    where multiple players in a group try to initiate the same quest. It ensures that
    only one player can start the quest, preventing duplication and maintaining game
    state consistency. This method typically checks if any group member already has
    the quest active or completed, and resolves conflicts by either denying the pickup
    or notifying the appropriate player. The method is crucial for maintaining proper
    quest progression in group scenarios and prevents potential client-server synchronization
    issues.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players involved in the
      quest conflict. Must be a valid group instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that is causing the conflict.
      Must be a valid quest ID registered in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group quest pickup
    code: 'Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      questPickup->HandleGroupQuestConflict(playerGroup, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during quest acceptance logic when a player
    attempts to start a quest that may already be active in their group. It's designed
    to prevent race conditions and ensure consistent quest state across all group
    members.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer or invalid questId can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate parameters before invoking the
    method.
