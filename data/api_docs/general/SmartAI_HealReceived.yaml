  class: SmartAI
  method: HealReceived
  signature: void SmartAI::HealReceived(Unit * doneBy, uint32 & addhealth)
documentation:
  brief: Handles healing received events in SmartAI, allowing custom logic when a
    unit is healed.
  description: The HealReceived method is a callback function within the SmartAI class
    that is invoked whenever a unit controlled by SmartAI receives healing. This method
    allows developers to implement custom behavior or logic when healing occurs, such
    as triggering specific actions, modifying the amount of healing received, or responding
    to healing events in AI decision-making. The method provides access to both the
    healer (doneBy) and the healing amount (addhealth), enabling fine-grained control
    over how the AI responds to healing events. This is particularly useful for creating
    intelligent NPC behavior that reacts dynamically to healing.
  parameters:
  - name: doneBy
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that performed the healing action. This
      represents the healer who caused the healing event.
  - name: addhealth
    description: Reference to a uint32 value representing the amount of health added.
      This value can be modified to adjust the healing amount before it is applied.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic HealReceived Implementation
    code: "void SmartAI::HealReceived(Unit* doneBy, uint32& addhealth)\n{\n    //\
      \ Log the healing event\n    if (doneBy)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"smartai\", \"\
      Unit %u was healed by %u for %u health.\", GetUnit()->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ doneBy->GetGUID().GetCounter(), addhealth);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Modify Healing Amount Based on Healer
    code: "void SmartAI::HealReceived(Unit* doneBy, uint32& addhealth)\n{\n    if\
      \ (doneBy && doneBy->IsPlayer())\n    {\n        // Increase healing by 50%\
      \ for player healers\n        addhealth = addhealth * 1.5f;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the SmartAI event system and should be overridden
    in custom AI implementations. The addhealth parameter is passed by reference,
    allowing modification of the healing amount before it's applied to the unit. Ensure
    that any modifications to addhealth are within reasonable bounds to prevent unexpected
    behavior or exploits.
  warnings: Modifying the addhealth value directly can affect game balance and may
    cause unintended consequences if not handled carefully. Be cautious when changing
    healing amounts, especially in PvP or raid environments where healing mechanics
    are critical.
