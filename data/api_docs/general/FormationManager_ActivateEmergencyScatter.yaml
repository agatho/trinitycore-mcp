documentation:
  brief: Initiates emergency scattering behavior for units in formation.
  description: The ActivateEmergencyScatter method triggers an emergency scattering
    mechanism for all units currently managed by the FormationManager. This function
    typically causes units to break their current formation and move away from each
    other in a randomized pattern, often used during combat situations or when a threat
    is detected. The behavior is designed to prevent clustering of units in dangerous
    scenarios, improving survival chances and tactical flexibility. This method does
    not require any parameters and operates on the internal state of the FormationManager.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FormationManager* manager = ...;

      manager->ActivateEmergencyScatter();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the movement behavior of units in real-time,
    potentially affecting their AI state and pathfinding. It should only be called
    when appropriate tactical conditions are met to avoid disrupting normal gameplay
    flow.
