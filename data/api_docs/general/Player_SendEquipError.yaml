documentation:
  brief: Sends an equipment error message to the player's client
  description: This method sends an equipment error message to the player's client,
    typically used when a player attempts to equip an item that cannot be equipped
    due to various restrictions such as level requirements, class restrictions, or
    other game mechanics. The method allows for custom error messages based on the
    type of error encountered. It is commonly used in conjunction with other methods
    like SendItemPushResult to provide feedback to players about their equipment actions.
  parameters:
  - name: msg
    description: The type of equipment error message to send, which can be one of
      several predefined constants such as EQUIPMENT_ERROR_ITEM_NOT_FOUND, EQUIPMENT_ERROR_CANT_EQUIP_LEVEL,
      etc.
  - name: item1
    description: First item involved in the error, typically used when the error involves
      two items (e.g., when swapping items or when an item cannot be equipped due
      to another item)
  - name: item2
    description: Second item involved in the error, often used for comparison purposes
      when both items are involved in the error
  - name: itemId
    description: The item ID of the item being processed, which is used to determine
      what specific item the error relates to
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();


      // Send an equipment error when a player tries to equip an item that is too
      low level

      player->SendEquipError(EQUIPMENT_ERROR_CANT_EQUIP_LEVEL, item, NULL, itemId);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: '// Send an equipment error when a player attempts to equip an item that
      requires a specific class

      Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* item = new Item();


      // Example of sending an error related to class restriction

      player->SendEquipError(EQUIPMENT_ERROR_ITEM_CLASS, item, NULL, itemId);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the player's communication system and should be used
    in conjunction with other player-related methods like SendItemPushResult to provide
    full feedback. It is typically called from within the context of item handling
    logic, such as when a player attempts to equip an item or when an item is swapped.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context; it's
    usually used in combination with other methods like SendItemPushResult to provide
    full feedback. Improper use can lead to incorrect client-side messages and confusion
    for players.
