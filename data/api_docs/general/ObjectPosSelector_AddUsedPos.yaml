  class: ObjectPosSelector
  method: AddUsedPos
  signature: void ObjectPosSelector::AddUsedPos(float size, float angle, float dist)
documentation:
  brief: Records a used position in the object positioning selector for collision
    avoidance during placement.
  description: The AddUsedPos method registers a previously occupied position within
    the ObjectPosSelector, which is used to determine valid locations for placing
    objects such as creatures or game objects in World of Warcraft. This method helps
    prevent overlapping placements by tracking already-used positions and their associated
    dimensions and angles. It's typically called during object placement calculations
    to ensure spatial integrity and avoid collisions with existing entities. The method
    takes size, angle, and distance parameters that define the area occupied by the
    placed object.
  parameters:
  - name: size
    description: The radius or size of the object being placed, used to determine
      collision boundaries
  - name: angle
    description: The angular orientation of the object in radians, affecting how placement
      areas are calculated
  - name: dist
    description: The distance from the center point where the object is placed, used
      to calculate actual position boundaries
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature placement
    code: 'ObjectPosSelector posSelector;

      float creatureSize = 2.0f;

      float orientation = M_PI / 4; // 45 degrees

      float distanceFromCenter = 5.0f;

      posSelector.AddUsedPos(creatureSize, orientation, distanceFromCenter);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple object placement tracking
    code: 'ObjectPosSelector posSelector;

      // Add several used positions

      posSelector.AddUsedPos(3.0f, 0.0f, 10.0f);

      posSelector.AddUsedPos(2.5f, M_PI/2, 8.0f);

      posSelector.AddUsedPos(4.0f, M_PI, 12.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal object positioning system used by TrinityCore's
    AI and placement algorithms. It's typically invoked automatically during object
    spawning operations rather than manually. The method assumes that all parameters
    are valid and within expected ranges for positioning calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (negative size, extremely
    large angles) may lead to incorrect collision detection or unexpected behavior
    in subsequent placement calculations. Ensure parameters represent realistic object
    dimensions and orientations.
