documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the FormationMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the FormationMgr
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the formation manager.
    This manager is responsible for handling creature formations and group positioning
    within the World of Warcraft emulation environment. The method ensures that only
    one FormationMgr instance exists throughout the application lifecycle, making
    it thread-safe for concurrent access. It is typically used by subsystems that
    need to manage or query formation data for groups of creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of FormationMgr. The returned pointer
    is never null as the singleton pattern guarantees its existence.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FormationMgr* mgr = FormationMgr::instance();

      // Use mgr to access formation management functions'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Formation Data
    code: "FormationMgr* mgr = FormationMgr::instance();\nif (mgr)\n{\n    // Access\
      \ formation data or methods\n    mgr->AddFormation(...);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The FormationMgr
    instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime of the application.
    As a singleton, it should be used carefully to avoid tight coupling in code design.
