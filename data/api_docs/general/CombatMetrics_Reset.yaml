documentation:
  brief: Resets all combat metrics data to initial state
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all combat-related statistics
    and tracking data within the CombatMetrics class. This includes clearing damage
    dealt, damage taken, healing done, healing taken, and other combat event counters.
    The method is typically invoked when starting a new combat encounter or when resetting
    a player's combat log to ensure accurate tracking of subsequent combat events.
    It ensures that all internal counters and accumulators are set back to zero or
    default values, providing a clean slate for new combat analysis.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Combat Metrics Reset
    code: 'CombatMetrics* metrics = player->GetCombatMetrics();

  - title: Reset Before New Encounter
    code: "void OnNewEncounter(Player* player)\n{\n    CombatMetrics* metrics = player->GetCombatMetrics();\n\
      \    metrics->Reset();\n    // Start fresh combat tracking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting new combat encounters to ensure
    accurate metric tracking. The reset operation is lightweight and does not involve
    any complex calculations or memory allocations.
