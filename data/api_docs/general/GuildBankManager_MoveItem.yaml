    fromSlot, uint32 toTab, uint32 toSlot)
documentation:
  brief: Moves an item from one slot to another within the guild bank.
  description: The MoveItem method facilitates the relocation of items between different
    tabs and slots in a player's guild bank. This operation is typically invoked when
    a guild member attempts to reorganize their stored items. The method validates
    that both the source and destination slots are valid, checks if the player has
    sufficient permissions to access the guild bank, and ensures that the move does
    not violate any item stacking or slot restrictions. It also handles updating the
    guild's bank log and may trigger notifications to other guild members depending
    on server configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player's GUID (Global Unique Identifier) who is attempting
      to perform the move operation. This parameter ensures that only authorized players
      can manipulate guild bank contents.
  - name: fromTab
    description: Index of the source tab from which the item will be moved. Tabs are
      zero-indexed, with 0 representing the first tab in the guild bank interface.
  - name: fromSlot
    description: Index of the slot within the source tab from which the item will
      be moved. Slots are also zero-indexed and correspond to specific positions within
      a tab.
  - name: toTab
    description: Index of the destination tab where the item will be moved. Must be
      a valid tab index within the guild bank's tab range.
  - name: toSlot
    description: Index of the slot within the destination tab where the item will
      be placed. Must be a valid slot index within the specified tab.
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully moved; otherwise, returns false.
    A return value of false may indicate invalid parameters, insufficient permissions,
    or an attempt to move an item into an occupied slot without proper stacking rules.

    code: "if (guildBankManager->MoveItem(&playerGuid, 0, 5, 1, 3)) {\n    // Successfully\
      \ moved item from tab 0, slot 5 to tab 1, slot 3\n    sLog->outString(\"Item\
      \ moved successfully\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to move item\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Failed to move item\");\n}"

  - title: Moving Item with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 fromTab = 0;\nuint32 fromSlot = 10;\nuint32 toTab = 2;\nuint32 toSlot\
      \ = 0;\nint playerGuid = 123456;\n\nif (guildBankManager->MoveItem(&playerGuid,\
      \ fromTab, fromSlot, toTab, toSlot)) {\n    sLog->outString(\"Item moved successfully\
      \ from tab %u slot %u to tab %u slot %u\", \n                    fromTab, fromSlot,\
      \ toTab, toSlot);\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to move item from\
      \ tab %u slot %u to tab %u slot %u\", \n                    fromTab, fromSlot,\
      \ toTab, toSlot);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already been authenticated and authorized
    to access the guild bank. It does not perform any checks on item type or stack
    limits beyond basic slot validation. The actual movement of items is handled internally
    by the TrinityCore framework, including updating database records and sending
    updates to clients.
  warnings: Ensure that all tab and slot indices are valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. Improper use of invalid indices may lead to crashes
    or data corruption in the guild bank system. Additionally, this function should
    not be called from multiple threads concurrently without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
