  class: ObjectMgr
  method: CheckDeclinedNames
  signature: bool ObjectMgr::CheckDeclinedNames(const std::wstring & w_ownname, const
    DeclinedName & names)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player's name and its declined forms are acceptable according
    to server rules.
  description: The CheckDeclinedNames method verifies that both the base name and
    all declined forms (singular, plural, etc.) of a player name conform to the server's
    naming restrictions. This includes checking for forbidden words, length limits,
    and character validity. The method ensures that when a player creates or changes
    their character name, the name and its declined variations do not violate any
    configured rules or filters set by the game administrator. It is typically called
    during character creation or name change processes to prevent invalid names from
    being accepted.
  parameters:
  - name: w_ownname
    description: The wide string representation of the player's base name that needs
      validation.
  - name: names
    description: Structure containing all declined forms (singular, plural, etc.)
      of the player's name to validate against server rules.
  returns: Returns true if all name variants pass validation checks; otherwise returns
    false if any variant fails due to rule violations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in character creation
    code: "if (!sObjectMgr->CheckDeclinedNames(wideName, declinedNames)) {\n    //\
      \ Handle invalid name\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with character creation"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation before name change
    code: "std::wstring newName = L\"NewPlayerName\";\nDeclinedName declinedForm;\n\
      // Populate declinedForm with various declined variants\nif (!sObjectMgr->CheckDeclinedNames(newName,\
      \ declinedForm)) {\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Invalid name provided.\");\n   \
      \ return false;\n}\n// Apply the new name"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on server configuration settings for forbidden word lists
    and naming rules. It is thread-safe as it only performs read operations on static
    data structures.
  warnings: Do not call this method without properly initializing the DeclinedName
    structure with all required variants, or it may lead to incomplete validation
    results.
