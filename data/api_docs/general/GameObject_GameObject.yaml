  brief: Initializes a new GameObject instance with default values and prepares it
    for use in the game world.
  description: The GameObject constructor initializes a new game object instance,
    setting up its internal state and preparing it for integration into the TrinityCore
    world system. This method is responsible for initializing core attributes such
    as the object's GUID, type, position, orientation, and other fundamental properties
    required for the object to exist within the game world. The constructor ensures
    that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized before
    the object can be spawned or referenced by other systems. It also sets up default
    values for various object states including visibility, interaction flags, and
    update timers.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GameObject instance
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      // The GameObject is now initialized and ready to be added to the world

      // Additional setup would be required before it becomes visible to players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should typically not be called directly by developers. Instead,
    GameObject instances are usually created through factory methods or by the core
    game system when loading objects from database or spawning new ones. The constructor
    performs minimal initialization and does not automatically register the object
    with the world manager.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of GameObject using this constructor without proper
    subsequent setup may result in undefined behavior or crashes. All GameObjects
    must be properly initialized with valid GUIDs, positions, and type information
    before they can be safely used in the game world.
