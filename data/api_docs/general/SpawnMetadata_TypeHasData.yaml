  method: TypeHasData
  signature: bool SpawnMetadata::TypeHasData(SpawnObjectType type)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the specified spawn object type has associated metadata data.
  description: The TypeHasData method determines if a given SpawnObjectType has any
    metadata registered or associated with it within the SpawnMetadata system. This
    is useful for verifying the existence of spawn-related configuration data before
    attempting to access or process it. The method performs a lookup in an internal
    data structure that maps spawn object types to their metadata availability status.
    It does not validate the actual content of the metadata, only whether it exists
    for the given type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified SpawnObjectType has associated metadata data;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check spawn type metadata availability
    code: "if (spawnMetadata->TypeHasData(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with operations that require GameObject metadata\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"spawn\"\
      , \"GameObject spawn type has metadata available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in conditional logic for spawn system initialization
    code: "void InitializeSpawnSystem() {\n    if (spawnMetadata->TypeHasData(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE))\
      \ {\n        LOG_INFO(\"spawn\", \"Creature metadata found, initializing creature\
      \ spawn handlers\");\n        // Initialize creature-specific spawn logic\n\
      \    } else {\n        LOG_WARN(\"spawn\", \"No creature metadata found, skipping\
      \ creature spawn initialization\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a fast lookup operation using an internal map structure.
    It is designed to be called frequently during spawn system initialization and
    runtime operations. The method assumes that SpawnObjectType enumeration values
    are properly defined and consistent with the metadata registration system.
  warnings: Ensure that SpawnObjectType values passed to this method are valid and
    registered within the system, as invalid types may lead to unexpected false results
    or undefined behavior if not properly handled by the calling code.
