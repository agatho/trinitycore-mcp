  signature: int TransportBase::GetTransportGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the transport object
  description: The GetTransportGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier
    assigned to a transport entity within the TrinityCore world server. This GUID
    is used internally by the game engine to uniquely identify and reference transport
    objects such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving platforms that players can board.
    The returned value represents the object's persistent identifier across server
    sessions and is essential for network synchronization, object tracking, and maintaining
    consistent state during player interactions with transports.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the transport object. This GUID
    is unique within the server instance and can be used to retrieve or reference
    the same transport object from various subsystems in the game engine.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve transport GUID
    code: 'TransportBase* transport = ...; // Assume transport is initialized

      int guid = transport->GetTransportGUID();

      // Use guid for further operations like object lookup or tracking'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using transport GUID in a player boarding scenario
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nTransportBase* transport = player->GetTransport();\n\
      if (transport)\n{\n    uint32 transportGuid = transport->GetTransportGUID();\n\
      \    // Log or store the transport GUID for tracking purposes\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player %u is on transport with GUID: %u\", player->GetGUIDLow(), transportGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object's
    state. The returned GUID value should be treated as a read-only identifier that
    remains consistent throughout the transport's lifetime in the game world.
