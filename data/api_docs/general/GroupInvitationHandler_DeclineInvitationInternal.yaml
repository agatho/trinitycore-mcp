  class: GroupInvitationHandler
  method: DeclineInvitationInternal
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::DeclineInvitationInternal(int inviterGuid,
    const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the internal logic for declining a group invitation in TrinityCore.
  description: The DeclineInvitationInternal method processes the rejection of a group
    invitation by a player. It takes the GUID of the inviter and a reason string as
    parameters, and performs necessary cleanup operations such as removing the invitation
    from the system, notifying relevant parties, and updating internal state. This
    method is typically invoked when a player chooses not to join a group that was
    offered to them. The method does not return any value but modifies internal game
    state to reflect the declined invitation.
  parameters:
  - name: inviterGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player who sent the
      group invitation.
  - name: reason
    description: A string explaining the reason for declining the invitation, which
      may be displayed to the inviter or logged for debugging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decline a group invitation with a custom reason
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.DeclineInvitationInternal(12345, "Not interested in this group");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal group invitation handling system and
    should not be called directly from external code unless implementing custom group
    logic. It assumes that the player has already been validated for the ability to
    decline an invitation.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in inconsistent
    game state or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the inviterGuid is valid and corresponds
    to a known player before invoking this method.
