  class: WheatyExceptionReport
  method: _GetProcessorName
  signature: BOOL WheatyExceptionReport::_GetProcessorName(TCHAR * sProcessorName,
    DWORD maxcount)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the processor name string into the provided buffer.
  description: The _GetProcessorName method attempts to retrieve the system's processor
    identification string and copies it into the supplied character buffer. This function
    is typically used for debugging or diagnostic purposes within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly in exception handling scenarios where detailed system
    information may be required. The method uses Windows API functions to obtain processor
    details and ensures thread safety during retrieval. It is designed to work with
    both ANSI and Unicode builds of the application, as indicated by the TCHAR parameter
    type.
  parameters:
  - name: sProcessorName
    description: Pointer to a character buffer that will receive the processor name
      string. Must be large enough to hold the full processor identifier string plus
      null terminator.
  - name: maxcount
    description: Maximum number of characters (including null terminator) that can
      be written to the sProcessorName buffer. Specifies the size of the buffer to
      prevent overflow.
  returns: Returns TRUE if the processor name was successfully retrieved and copied
    into the buffer, or FALSE if an error occurred during retrieval or if the buffer
    is too small.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "TCHAR processorName[256];\nif (exceptionReport._GetProcessorName(processorName,\
      \ 256)) {\n    // Successfully retrieved processor name\n    printf(\"Processor:\
      \ %s\\n\", processorName);\n} else {\n    // Failed to retrieve processor name\n\
      \    printf(\"Failed to get processor name.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally relies on Windows API functions such as GetSystemInfo
    and potentially CPUID instructions to extract processor information. The buffer
    size should always be validated before calling this function to avoid buffer overflows.
    In a TrinityCore context, this method might be called during crash reporting or
    system diagnostics.
  warnings: Ensure that the sProcessorName buffer is sufficiently large (at least
    maxcount characters) to prevent buffer overflow issues. This function may fail
    on systems where processor information cannot be retrieved due to security restrictions
    or virtualization layers.
