  brief: Updates the mount capability state for the unit based on current conditions
    and restrictions
  description: The UpdateMountCapability method refreshes the mountable status of
    a Unit by evaluating various game mechanics such as player state, environmental
    restrictions, and mounted creature conditions. This method is typically invoked
    when a unit's ability to mount or dismount changes due to external factors like
    being in combat, entering water, or applying/removing mount restrictions. It ensures
    that the client-side mount state is synchronized with the server-side logic, preventing
    invalid mount states during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = ...;

      player->UpdateMountCapability();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat State Change
    code: "void OnCombatEnter(Unit* unit)\n{\n    // Ensure mount state is updated\
      \ when entering combat\n    unit->UpdateMountCapability();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally checks for various conditions including player flags,
    terrain type, and current combat status. It may trigger client updates to synchronize
    the mount state with the visual representation.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently without proper condition checking can cause
    unnecessary network traffic or performance overhead. Ensure it's only called when
    mount capability actually changes.
