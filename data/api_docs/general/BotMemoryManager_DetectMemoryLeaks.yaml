documentation:
  brief: Checks for memory leaks in the bot memory management system
  description: The DetectMemoryLeaks method performs a comprehensive scan of the bot
    memory manager to identify any unreleased or leaked memory blocks. This function
    is typically invoked during shutdown or debugging phases to ensure no memory corruption
    occurs within the bot subsystem. It analyzes allocated memory regions and compares
    them against expected deallocation patterns to detect potential leaks. The method
    does not modify any state but rather reports findings through logging mechanisms.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shutdown Routine
    code: "void BotWorld::OnShutdown()\n{\n    sBotMemoryManager->DetectMemoryLeaks();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during development or debugging phases
    as it may introduce performance overhead. It relies on debug build memory tracking
    features and will not detect leaks in release builds without proper instrumentation.
  warnings: Calling this function in production environments may cause performance
    degradation. The method assumes all allocations are tracked through the standard
    memory manager interface, so custom allocation patterns might not be detected
    correctly.
