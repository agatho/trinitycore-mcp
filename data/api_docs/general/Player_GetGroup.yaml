  method: GetGroup
  signature: const Group * Player::GetGroup() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the group that the player is currently a member of, or nullptr if
    not in a group.
  description: The GetGroup method retrieves the Group object that the player belongs
    to. This method is commonly used to determine if a player is in a group and to
    access group-related functionality such as group members, loot distribution methods,
    and group leader information. The returned pointer will be nullptr if the player
    is not currently in a group, which can happen when the player is solo or when
    the group has been disbanded. This method does not create or modify any group;
    it simply returns the current group reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Group object that the player belongs to, or nullptr
    if the player is not in a group. The returned pointer is const and should not
    be modified directly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (Player* player = GetGroup()) {\n    // Player is in a group\n    //\
      \ Do something with the group\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not in a group\n\
      \    // Handle solo case\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking group membership
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nconst Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n\
      if (group != nullptr) {\n    // Player is in a group\n    // Access group members\n\
      \    for (Group::MemberSlot::const_iterator i = group->begin(); i != group->end();\
      \ ++i)\n    {\n        // Iterate through group members\n    }\n}\nelse {\n\
      \    // Player is not in a group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other group-related methods such as GetGroupID() or GetGroupMembers().
    The method returns a const pointer to ensure that the group object cannot be modified
    directly by the calling code.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method in combination with other group-related
    methods, as it may return nullptr if the player is not in a group. Always check
    for null before accessing group members or performing operations that require
    group membership.
