documentation:
  brief: Processes the queued quest pickup events for players in the game world
  description: The ProcessPickupQueue method handles all pending quest pickup operations
    that have been scheduled for execution. This method iterates through a queue of
    quest pickup requests and processes each one, typically involving updating player
    quest data, awarding quest rewards, and notifying the client of changes. It is
    designed to be called periodically by the game loop or in response to specific
    events such as player interaction with quest givers or objects. The method ensures
    that quest pickup operations are handled in a controlled manner without blocking
    the main game thread.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Other update logic...\n    sQuestPickup->ProcessPickupQueue();\n\
      \    // More update logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Trigger for Quest Pickup
    code: "void Player::HandleQuestPickup(uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Queue the pickup\
      \ operation\n    sQuestPickup->QueuePickup(questId, this);\n    \n    // Process\
      \ immediately if needed\n    sQuestPickup->ProcessPickupQueue();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game loop or during specific
    update phases. It's important to note that this method may perform database operations
    and should be used carefully in performance-critical sections of code. The queue
    processing happens synchronously, so it can block execution until all queued pickups
    are handled.
  warnings: Calling ProcessPickupQueue from within another method that already holds
    locks might lead to deadlocks if the method internally tries to acquire additional
    locks. Also, excessive calls to this method in short time intervals may cause
    performance degradation due to repeated database access.
