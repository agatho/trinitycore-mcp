  class: Battlefield
  method: RegisterZone
  signature: void Battlefield::RegisterZone(int zoneid)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a zone with the battlefield system for handling battlefield-related
    events and updates.
  description: The RegisterZone method integrates a specified zone ID into the battlefield
    framework, enabling the system to track and manage battlefield activities within
    that zone. This includes processing player entries, handling objective captures,
    and managing the overall battlefield state. The method typically gets invoked
    during server initialization or when a new battlefield zone is added to the game
    world. It ensures that all relevant battlefield mechanics are properly initialized
    for the specified zone.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneid
    description: The unique identifier of the zone to be registered with the battlefield
      system. This value must correspond to a valid zone in the game world and typically
      maps to a specific battlefield instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Registration
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = new Battlefield();

      bf->RegisterZone(1234); // Register zone with ID 1234 as a battlefield'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Zone Registration During Runtime
    code: "void AddNewBattlefieldZone(uint32 newZoneId)\n{\n    Battlefield* bf =\
      \ sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByZoneId(newZoneId);\n    if (bf)\n    {\n\
      \        bf->RegisterZone(newZoneId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the battlefield manager during
    zone initialization. Developers should ensure that the zone ID passed to this
    method corresponds to a valid battlefield zone in the game world. The registration
    process may involve setting up internal data structures and event handlers for
    the specified zone.
  warnings: Calling RegisterZone with an invalid or non-existent zone ID can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the zone ID is validated before
    calling this method, especially when dynamically registering zones at runtime.
