  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: IsReady
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::IsReady() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the BotAIInitializer is fully initialized and ready for use.
  description: The IsReady method determines whether the BotAIInitializer has completed
    its initialization process and is prepared to manage bot AI behavior. This method
    typically checks internal state flags or dependencies that must be satisfied before
    the initializer can safely be used. It ensures that all required resources, configurations,
    and subsystems are properly set up. The return value indicates readiness for bot
    AI operations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAIInitializer is fully initialized and ready to
    manage bot AI behavior; otherwise returns false if initialization is incomplete
    or failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botAIInitializer.IsReady()) {\n    // Proceed with bot AI operations\n\
      \    botAIInitializer.InitializeBots();\n} else {\n    // Wait or handle initialization\
      \ failure\n    sLog->outString(\"BotAIInitializer not ready yet.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in game loop contexts to ensure that bot AI
    systems are properly initialized before attempting to spawn or control bots. It
    may involve checking for loaded databases, configuration files, or other subsystem
    dependencies.
