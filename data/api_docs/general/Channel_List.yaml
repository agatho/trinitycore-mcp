  class: Channel
  method: List
  signature: void Channel::List(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a list of players currently in the channel to the specified player.
  description: The Channel::List method retrieves and sends a formatted list of all
    players currently subscribed to the channel to the requesting player. This method
    is typically invoked when a player uses the /list command in-game to see who else
    is in the channel. The implementation handles formatting the player names into
    a readable list and sending it via the appropriate network packet to the player's
    client. It ensures that only players who are actually in the channel receive the
    list, and respects any privacy or visibility settings of the players within the
    channel.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object requesting the channel list. This
      player must be subscribed to the channel for the list to be sent.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in command handler
    code: "void HandleChannelListCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args)\n\
      {\n    if (!args || !strlen(args))\n        return;\n\n    Channel* channel\
      \ = sChatHandler->GetChannel(args);\n    if (channel)\n        channel->List(handler->GetPlayer());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally iterates through all members of the channel and formats
    their names for display. It may be called from different threads, so internal
    synchronization is likely required to prevent race conditions when accessing channel
    member lists.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid crashes. Also, be aware that calling this on a channel the
    player isn't in may result in no action being taken or an empty list being sent.
