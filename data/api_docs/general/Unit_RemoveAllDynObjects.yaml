  method: RemoveAllDynObjects
  signature: void Unit::RemoveAllDynObjects()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all dynamic objects from the unit's ownership.
  description: This method removes all dynamic objects (such as summoning stones,
    traps, and other summoned entities) that are currently under the control of the
    unit. It is typically used during cleanup operations when a unit is being destroyed
    or when removing all summoned objects to prevent memory leaks or unwanted behavior.
    The method ensures that all dynamic object references are cleared from the unit's
    internal list, effectively releasing control over these objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->RemoveAllDynObjects();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully during destruction or cleanup processes
    to avoid dangling references. It is typically invoked automatically when a unit
    is destroyed, but developers may need to explicitly call it in certain scenarios
    where dynamic objects are manually created and managed.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to memory leaks or crashes if dynamic
    objects are still referenced after removal. Ensure that all references to the
    dynamic objects are properly cleared before calling this method.
