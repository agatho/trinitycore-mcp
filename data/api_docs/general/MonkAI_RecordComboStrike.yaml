  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordComboStrike
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordComboStrike(int spellId, bool successful)
documentation:
  brief: Records a combo strike for the Monk AI, updating internal state based on
    spell ID and success status.
  description: The RecordComboStrike method is used within the MonkAI class to track
    and manage combo point generation from successful or failed attacks. This method
    updates the AI's internal combo point counter and potentially triggers other combo-related
    behaviors such as spell cooldowns or resource management. It is typically called
    when a monk performs an attack that can generate combo points, like Kick, Tiger
    Palm, or other combo-generating abilities. The method accepts a spell ID to identify
    which ability was used and a boolean flag indicating whether the attack was successful
    in generating combo points.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell that initiated the combo strike. This
      value is used to determine the type of combo point generation and associated
      mechanics.
  - name: successful
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the combo strike was successful
      in generating combo points. True indicates successful generation, false indicates
      failure or no combo point gain.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: monkAI->RecordComboStrike(109132, true); // Records a successful Tiger Palm
      strike
    language: cpp
  - title: Failed Combo Strike
    code: monkAI->RecordComboStrike(100780, false); // Records a failed Kick ability
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's combo point tracking system and directly
    influences how the AI behaves during combat. It should be called after any combo-generating
    ability is used, regardless of whether it hits or misses. The spell ID must correspond
    to a valid monk ability that can generate combo points.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may lead to incorrect combo
    point tracking and affect AI behavior. Ensure the spellId corresponds to a legitimate
    monk combo-generating ability before calling.
