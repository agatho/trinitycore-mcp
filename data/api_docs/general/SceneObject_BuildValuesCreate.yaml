documentation:
  brief: Populates the data buffer with create packet values for a scene object
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for constructing the initial
    state data that will be sent to clients when a scene object is created. This method
    prepares the object's fields in a format suitable for network transmission, typically
    used in the creation of GameObject or DynamicObject packets. It fills the provided
    data array with the appropriate field values based on the object's current state
    and flags. The method is commonly invoked during the object initialization phase
    when the scene object is being added to the world and needs to be synchronized
    with client instances.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array that will be filled with the object's
      field values for the create packet. This buffer must be pre-allocated with sufficient
      space to hold all required fields.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that determine which fields should be included in the
      data buffer. These flags control the serialization behavior and can indicate
      various object states or visibility settings.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the target object's data,
      used for reference during field population. This parameter may be NULL if no
      target data is required for this operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesCreate
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();

      int createData[100];

      int flags = 0x01;

      sceneObj->BuildValuesCreate(createData, flags, nullptr);

      // createData now contains the serialized object fields for client creation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BuildValuesCreate with target reference
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();

      int createData[100];

      int flags = 0x03;

      int targetData[50] = {0};

      targetData[0] = 12345;

      sceneObj->BuildValuesCreate(createData, flags, targetData);

      // The method uses targetData to populate certain fields in createData'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    object creation and synchronization. Developers should ensure that the data buffer
    passed to this method has sufficient capacity to accommodate all required field
    values. The flags parameter may influence which fields are populated, so understanding
    the flag definitions is important for correct usage.
  warnings: Incorrectly sized data buffers can lead to memory corruption or undefined
    behavior. The target parameter must be properly initialized if used, otherwise
    passing NULL is safe but may affect field population. This method should not be
    called on objects that are already in the world as it's designed for initial creation
    packets only.
