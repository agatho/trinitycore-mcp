  class: BloodDeathKnight
  method: ConsumeRunes
  signature: void BloodDeathKnight::ConsumeRunes(uint32 blood, uint32 frost, uint32
    unholy)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes specified amounts of blood, frost, and unholy runes for the death
    knight.
  description: The ConsumeRunes method is used to deduct a specified number of runes
    from the death knight's rune pool. This method is typically invoked when a death
    knight uses abilities that require rune consumption, such as Blood Strike or Frost
    Strike. The method adjusts the internal rune counts for each rune type (blood,
    frost, unholy) and ensures that the requested amounts do not exceed the available
    runes. It does not directly handle cooldowns or visual effects; those are managed
    by other systems within the death knight's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: blood
    description: The number of blood runes to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount of blood rune energy required for the ability being
      used.
  - name: frost
    description: The number of frost runes to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount of frost rune energy required for the ability being
      used.
  - name: unholy
    description: The number of unholy runes to consume. Must be a non-negative integer
      representing the amount of unholy rune energy required for the ability being
      used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume one blood and one frost rune
    code: player->To<DeathKnight>()->ConsumeRunes(1, 1, 0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Consume all three rune types for a powerful ability
    code: player->To<DeathKnight>()->ConsumeRunes(1, 1, 1);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the caller has already validated that sufficient
    runes are available. It does not perform any checks for rune availability or handle
    rune regeneration; it simply decrements the internal counters. The death knight's
    AI system is responsible for managing rune regeneration and ensuring proper cooldowns.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that enough runes exist may result
    in negative rune counts, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in
    subsequent rune usage logic. Always ensure rune availability before calling this
    function.
