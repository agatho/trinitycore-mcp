  class: LfgPlayerRewardData
  method: LfgPlayerRewardData
  signature: void LfgPlayerRewardData::LfgPlayerRewardData(uint32 random, uint32 current,
    bool _done, const Quest * _quest)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of LfgPlayerRewardData with specified random,
    current, done status, and quest information.
  description: The LfgPlayerRewardData constructor initializes a player's reward data
    for Looking For Group (LFG) activities. It sets up internal state variables including
    a random value used for reward distribution, the current quest reward amount,
    a boolean flag indicating whether the quest has been completed, and a pointer
    to the associated quest object. This class is typically used within TrinityCore's
    LFG system to track player rewards and progress during group activities such as
    dungeons or raids. The initialization ensures that all necessary data is properly
    set before the player can receive rewards or progress through LFG content.
  parameters:
  - name: random
    description: A random value used for determining reward distribution in LFG activities.
      This value typically represents a seed or identifier used to randomize reward
      selection among players.
  - name: current
    description: The current reward amount or value associated with the player's quest
      progress in the LFG system.
  - name: _done
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the player has completed the associated
      quest. True means the quest is done, false otherwise.
  - name: _quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that this reward data is associated with.
      Can be null if no specific quest is linked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of LfgPlayerRewardData
    code: 'LfgPlayerRewardData rewardData(42, 100, true, questPtr);

      // Initializes a reward data object with random=42, current=100,

      // done=true, and associated with questPtr'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the LFG system when creating
    player reward tracking objects. Developers should ensure that the quest pointer
    passed is valid and not null if the reward data will be used for actual reward
    calculations.
  warnings: Passing a null quest pointer may lead to undefined behavior when accessing
    quest properties later. Ensure all parameters are properly initialized before
    calling this constructor.
