  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: SelectBracket
  signature: const LevelBracket * BotLevelDistribution::SelectBracket(int faction)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the appropriate level bracket based on the faction for
    bot distribution.
  description: The SelectBracket method determines and returns the correct LevelBracket
    structure that corresponds to the specified faction. This method is typically
    used in the context of bot management or AI behavior where different factions
    require different level distributions. The method does not take any parameters,
    implying it uses internal state or configuration to determine the appropriate
    bracket based on the current context or default settings. It's designed to provide
    a consistent interface for accessing faction-specific level brackets within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const LevelBracket object that represents the selected bracket
    for the specified faction. Returns nullptr if no valid bracket can be determined
    or if the internal state is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const LevelBracket* bracket = botLevelDistribution.SelectBracket(0);\n\
      if (bracket != nullptr) {\n    // Use the bracket for bot level distribution\
      \ logic\n    std::cout << \"Selected bracket: \" << bracket->minLevel << \"\
      \ - \" << bracket->maxLevel << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal faction mappings or configuration data.
    It's important to ensure that the BotLevelDistribution object is properly initialized
    before calling this method. The returned pointer should be checked for null before
    use to prevent access violations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the BotLevelDistribution
    object may result in undefined behavior or return invalid pointers. Always validate
    the returned pointer before dereferencing it.
