  class: RestStrategy
  method: OnDeactivate
  signature: void RestStrategy::OnDeactivate(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the rest strategy for a bot AI, stopping any active resting behavior
    and resetting relevant internal states.
  description: The OnDeactivate method is called when the RestStrategy is deactivated
    within the TrinityCore bot AI system. This typically occurs when the bot transitions
    away from a resting state or when the strategy is explicitly disabled. The method
    ensures that any ongoing rest-related activities are properly halted, internal
    flags and timers are reset, and the bot's AI state is updated to reflect that
    resting is no longer active. This method plays a critical role in maintaining
    proper bot behavior consistency during state transitions within the AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns this strategy. Used to access
      bot-specific data, state management, and AI context during deactivation.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void example() {\n    BotAI* ai = GetBotAI();\n    RestStrategy strategy;\n\
      \    strategy.OnDeactivate(ai);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI state management system when transitioning
    between different strategies. It's important that this method properly cleans
    up any resources or states associated with resting behavior to prevent undefined
    behavior during subsequent AI operations.
