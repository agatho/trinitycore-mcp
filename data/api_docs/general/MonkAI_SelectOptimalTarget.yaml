  class: MonkAI
  method: SelectOptimalTarget
  signature: int * MonkAI::SelectOptimalTarget(const int & enemies)
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the optimal target for a Monk AI from a list of available
    enemies.
  description: The SelectOptimalTarget method determines the most suitable enemy target
    for a Monk AI character based on various combat factors such as threat level,
    distance, health, and target priority. This method is typically invoked during
    the AI's decision-making process to ensure optimal engagement with the most dangerous
    or accessible opponent. The method takes into account the current state of the
    AI and its surrounding environment to make an informed targeting decision. It
    returns a pointer to the selected enemy's identifier (GUID), which can then be
    used for further actions like casting spells or moving toward the target.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the selected optimal target.
    Returns NULL if no valid target is found or if the AI is unable to select a suitable
    enemy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in Monk AI logic
    code: "int* target = ai->SelectOptimalTarget(enemies);\nif (target != nullptr)\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with attack or movement towards the selected target\n  \
      \  printf(\"Selected target GUID: %d\\n\", *target);\n} else {\n    // No valid\
      \ target found, possibly switch to passive mode\n    printf(\"No suitable target\
      \ found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's core decision-making system and should
    be called regularly within the AI update loop. The method may perform complex
    calculations involving threat tables, range checks, and target prioritization
    algorithms to determine the best possible enemy to engage.
  warnings: Ensure that the enemies parameter passed into this method contains valid
    data; otherwise, incorrect targeting behavior may occur. Also note that returning
    a NULL pointer indicates no valid target was found, which should be handled gracefully
    by the calling code.
