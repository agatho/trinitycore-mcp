documentation:
  brief: Compares two JumpMovementParams objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a component-wise comparison of two JumpMovementParams
    objects to determine if they are identical. This comparison checks whether all
    member variables of the current object match those of the provided object. The
    method is typically used in movement-related systems within TrinityCore to verify
    that jump movement parameters are consistent, such as when validating or synchronizing
    player jump states across the game world. It ensures that two jump movement configurations
    are functionally equivalent.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The JumpMovementParams object to compare against the current instance.
  returns: True if all member variables of both objects are equal; otherwise, false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two JumpMovementParams instances
    code: 'JumpMovementParams params1;

      JumpMovementParams params2;

      bool isEqual = (params1 == params2); // Returns true if all members match'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using operator== in a movement validation context
    code: "void ValidateJumpMovement(const JumpMovementParams& original, const JumpMovementParams&\
      \ current) {\n    if (original == current) {\n        // Movement parameters\
      \ are consistent\n        sLog->outString(\"Jump parameters unchanged.\");\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Movement parameters differ\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Jump parameters modified.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is commonly used in TrinityCore's movement system to ensure
    consistency of jump parameters during network synchronization or state comparisons.
    It assumes that all member variables within JumpMovementParams are comparable
    using their own equality operators.
