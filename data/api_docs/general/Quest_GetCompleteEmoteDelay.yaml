  class: Quest
  method: GetCompleteEmoteDelay
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetCompleteEmoteDelay() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the delay in milliseconds before completing emote is displayed for
    a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the time delay in milliseconds that must pass
    before the completion emote is shown to the player after they have completed the
    quest. The delay represents the time between the quest completion and when the
    emote animation appears, which is typically used to give players time to process
    the completion before seeing the visual emote. This value is defined by the quest's
    database configuration and affects gameplay mechanics related to quest completion
    timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the delay in milliseconds before the completion emote is displayed,
    or 0 if no delay is specified.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 delay = quest->GetCompleteEmoteDelay();\nif (delay > 0)\n{\n   \
      \ // Wait for the delay before showing emote\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest completion
    methods to properly manage timing of emote display. The delay value may vary depending
    on the specific quest configuration and can be affected by server settings.
  warnings: The delay value returned by this method may be zero, which means no delay
    is applied. Care should be taken when using this value in conjunction with other
    timing methods to ensure proper synchronization of emote display.
