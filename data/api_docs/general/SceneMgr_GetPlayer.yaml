documentation:
  brief: Returns the Player object associated with the current scene context
  description: The GetPlayer method retrieves the Player instance that is currently
    associated with the SceneMgr's context. This method is typically used within the
    scope of a scene-related operation where a player's state or data needs to be
    accessed. The returned pointer may be null if no player is currently bound to
    the scene manager's context, which can occur during initialization or cleanup
    phases. This method does not perform any validation on the player object itself,
    so callers should ensure the returned pointer is valid before dereferencing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object if one is associated with the current scene
    context; otherwise, returns nullptr
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access player data
    code: "Player* player = sSceneMgr->GetPlayer();\nif (player)\n{\n    uint32 accountId\
      \ = player->GetSession()->GetAccountId();\n    // Use account ID for further\
      \ processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe usage with null check
    code: "Player* player = sSceneMgr->GetPlayer();\nif (player && player->IsInWorld())\n\
      {\n    // Safe to access player's world data\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Welcome to the scene!\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no valid player\
      \ is present\n    sLog->outError(\"No valid player found in scene context\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the SceneMgr instance has a valid player context
    established. The method does not perform any thread synchronization, so access
    should be coordinated if used from multiple threads. The returned Player pointer
    is only valid for the duration of the current scene operation and may become invalid
    after scene transitions.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned Player pointer is always valid. Always check
    for null before dereferencing. This method may return nullptr during initialization
    or cleanup phases, which could lead to crashes if not properly handled.
