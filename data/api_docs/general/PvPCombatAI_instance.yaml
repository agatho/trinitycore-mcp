documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PvPCombatAI class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PvPCombatAI
    class, providing global access to a single instance of the AI controller used
    for player versus player combat behavior. This method ensures that only one PvPCombatAI
    object exists throughout the game session, maintaining consistent AI state and
    behavior for all PvP encounters. The returned instance is typically used by the
    core game systems to manage player AI actions during battlegrounds, arenas, and
    other PvP scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of PvPCombatAI, or nullptr if the instance
    has not been initialized yet
  examples:
  - title: Accessing PvP Combat AI Instance
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = PvPCombatAI::instance();\nif (ai)\n{\n    // Use the\
      \ AI instance for PvP combat logic\n    ai->UpdateAI(1000);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking AI Instance Before Usage
    code: "PvPCombatAI* ai = PvPCombatAI::instance();\nif (ai != nullptr)\n{\n   \
      \ // Safe to use the AI instance\n    ai->HandlePlayerPvPCombat(player, target);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where AI hasn't been initialized yet\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      PvPCombatAI not initialized\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the singleton pattern which means it should only be called
    after the AI system has been properly initialized. The instance is typically created
    during server startup or when a player enters a PvP zone. This implementation
    may not be thread-safe and should be used carefully in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Using this method without ensuring proper initialization can lead to null
    pointer dereferences. The singleton pattern means that all code accessing the
    AI will share the same instance, so modifications made by one component affect
    all others. Avoid calling this method during critical sections where thread safety
    is required.
