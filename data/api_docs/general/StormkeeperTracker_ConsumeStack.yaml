  method: ConsumeStack
  signature: void StormkeeperTracker::ConsumeStack()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the current stack of Stormkeeper items, reducing the count and potentially
    triggering effects.
  description: The ConsumeStack method is responsible for processing the consumption
    of a full stack of Stormkeeper items. This typically occurs when a player uses
    or interacts with a stack of these items, causing the stack to be reduced by one.
    The method may trigger additional game mechanics such as spell effects, item cooldowns,
    or resource updates depending on the implementation. It is designed to handle
    the internal state management of the Stormkeeper item stack and ensure proper
    decrementing of item counts within the player's inventory or active effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Interaction
    code: "void Player::UseStormkeeperStack()\n{\n    if (m_stormkeeperTracker)\n\
      \        m_stormkeeperTracker->ConsumeStack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    interacts with Stormkeeper items. It assumes that the stack has been validated
    for consumption and that the item state is consistent before calling.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method may lead to incorrect stack counts, potential
    exploits through item duplication, or inconsistent game state if not properly
    synchronized with inventory updates.
