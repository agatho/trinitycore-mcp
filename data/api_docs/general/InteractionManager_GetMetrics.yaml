  method: GetMetrics
  signature: InteractionMetrics InteractionManager::GetMetrics(InteractionType type)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves interaction metrics for a specified interaction type.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a structured set of metrics related to
    a specific type of interaction within the game. These metrics typically include
    data such as interaction counts, success rates, and timing information that can
    be used for performance analysis, debugging, or gameplay balancing. The method
    is designed to provide insight into how players interact with various game systems,
    objects, or NPCs. It requires a valid InteractionType parameter to determine which
    set of metrics to retrieve. This method does not modify any state and is safe
    for read-only access.
  parameters: []
  returns: An InteractionMetrics object containing detailed statistics and data points
    related to the specified interaction type. The structure of this object includes
    fields such as total interactions, successful interactions, average time spent,
    and other relevant performance indicators depending on the interaction type.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Metrics for Quest Interactions
    code: 'InteractionMetrics questMetrics = interactionManager.GetMetrics(InteractionType::QUEST);

      // Use questMetrics to analyze quest completion rates or interaction timing'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal counters and tracking mechanisms
    within the TrinityCore framework. It may cache results for performance reasons,
    especially if called frequently with the same interaction type. Ensure that the
    InteractionType enum values are properly defined and supported by the system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the InteractionManager
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect metric data. Also, be cautious when
    using this in high-frequency loops as it might impact performance if not optimized
    internally.
