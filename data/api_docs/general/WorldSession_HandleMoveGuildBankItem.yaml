documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to move items within the guild bank.
  description: The HandleMoveGuildBankItem method processes a packet sent by the client
    when a player attempts to move an item from one slot to another within their guild's
    bank. This method validates the move operation, checks for proper permissions
    and inventory constraints, and updates the guild bank's item storage accordingly.
    It ensures that only authorized guild members can manipulate guild bank items
    and enforces rules such as item stacking limits and slot restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveGuildBankItem(WorldPackets::Guild::MoveGuildBankItem&\
      \ moveGuildBankItem)\n{\n    // Process the item movement request\n    // Validate\
      \ permissions and item positions\n    // Update guild bank storage\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild bank management system and relies on proper
    guild membership checks. The implementation assumes that all necessary validation
    has been performed before this method is called, including checking if the player
    is in a guild and has permission to access the guild bank.
  warnings: Improper handling of item movement can lead to inconsistencies in guild
    bank state. Ensure that all move operations are validated against current guild
    permissions and inventory constraints to prevent unauthorized access or data corruption.
