documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another TriggerFactory object to this instance
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of all members
    from the provided TriggerFactory object to the current instance. This is a standard
    copy assignment operator that ensures proper resource management and avoids shallow
    copying issues. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and trigger systems, this operation
    allows for the duplication of trigger configurations or states between different
    trigger factory instances. The method handles internal data structures such as
    trigger definitions, conditions, and associated metadata. It returns a reference
    to the current object to enable chaining of assignments.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source TriggerFactory object whose contents will be copied to
      this instance
  returns: A reference to the current TriggerFactory instance (this), enabling assignment
    chaining such as factory1 = factory2 = factory3;
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment
    code: 'TriggerFactory factory1;

      TriggerFactory factory2;

      // ... initialize factory2 with some trigger data

      factory1 = factory2; // Assigns all contents of factory2 to factory1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'TriggerFactory factory1, factory2, factory3;

      // ... initialize factories with trigger data

      factory1 = factory2 = factory3; // All factories will contain the same trigger
      configuration'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements deep copying to prevent shared ownership
    of internal resources. In TrinityCore's context, this is important for maintaining
    isolated trigger configurations when working with AI systems or event triggers.
    The implementation should handle any dynamically allocated memory or complex data
    structures within the TriggerFactory class.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large TriggerFactory objects as this may involve
    significant memory copying operations. Ensure that the source object remains valid
    throughout the assignment operation to avoid undefined behavior.
