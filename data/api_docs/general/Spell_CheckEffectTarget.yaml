    & spellEffectInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell effect target is valid for the given item and spell effect
    information
  description: The CheckEffectTarget method verifies whether a spell effect's target
    is valid based on the provided item and spell effect information. It evaluates
    the target's validity in the context of spell mechanics, ensuring that the target
    meets specific criteria required for the spell to function properly. This method
    is crucial for validating spell targets during spell execution and helps prevent
    invalid spell effects from being applied to targets.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an Item object representing the target of the spell effect.
      This parameter can be nullptr if no item is involved in the spell effect.
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Reference to SpellEffectInfo structure containing detailed information
      about the spell effect being evaluated. This includes target type, effects,
      and other relevant parameters.
  returns: Returns true if the spell effect target is valid, false otherwise. The
    method returns false when the target fails validation checks or when the spell
    effect cannot be applied to the given target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      Item* target = new Item();

      SpellEffectInfo effectInfo;

      bool result = spell->CheckEffectTarget(target, effectInfo);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell validation process and should be called
    during spell execution to ensure proper targeting. Performance considerations
    include checking target validity efficiently without causing delays in spell processing.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method with null pointers as it may
    lead to undefined behavior if not handled properly. Ensure that target objects
    are valid before calling this method.
