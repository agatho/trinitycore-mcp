  brief: Initializes a new Line-of-Sight context for performing visibility checks
    in the game world.
  description: The LoSContext constructor initializes a new instance of the Line-of-Sight
    context, which is used to perform visibility calculations between two points in
    the World of Warcraft game world. This context typically stores information about
    the start and end positions, obstacles, and other relevant data needed for determining
    whether an object or point is visible from another. It's commonly used in spell
    casting, NPC behavior, and player interaction systems where line-of-sight validation
    is required. The initialization process sets up internal state variables that
    are used by subsequent methods like CheckLoS() to perform actual visibility checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic LoSContext Initialization
    code: 'LoSContext context;

      // The context is now initialized and ready for use

      // with methods like CheckLoS() to validate visibility'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using LoSContext in Spell Casting
    code: "void CastSpell(Unit* caster, Unit* target) {\n    LoSContext context;\n\
      \    if (context.CheckLoS(caster->GetPosition(), target->GetPosition())) {\n\
      \        // Perform spell casting since line of sight is clear\n        caster->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_ID, true);\n    } else {\n        // Line of sight blocked, cannot cast\n\
      \        caster->SendSpellFailed(SPELL_ID, SPELL_FAILED_NO_LINE_OF_SIGHT);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any expensive operations or network calls.
    It simply initializes internal data structures required for line-of-sight calculations.
    The actual visibility check is performed by calling methods like CheckLoS() on
    the initialized context. Multiple contexts can be created and used simultaneously
    in different parts of the codebase.
  warnings: The LoSContext class should not be used directly without proper initialization.
    While this constructor doesn't require parameters, it's important to ensure that
    any subsequent calls to visibility-checking methods are made with valid positions
    and that the context is properly managed to avoid memory leaks or incorrect behavior.
