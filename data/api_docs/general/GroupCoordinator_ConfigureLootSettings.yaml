api:
  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: ConfigureLootSettings
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::ConfigureLootSettings(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Configures loot settings for a specified group within the World of Warcraft
    instance.
  description: The ConfigureLootSettings method initializes or updates the loot distribution
    rules and options for a given group in TrinityCore. This includes setting up loot
    thresholds, loot methods (such as free-for-all, round-robin, or master loot),
    and other group-specific loot configurations that determine how items are distributed
    among group members. The method ensures that all group members have consistent
    loot settings based on the configured parameters, which is essential for maintaining
    fairness and proper gameplay mechanics during dungeon and raid encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Loot Configuration
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n   \
      \ GroupCoordinator coordinator;\n    coordinator.ConfigureLootSettings(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the group's internal loot settings structure
    and may trigger updates to client-side loot displays. It should be called when
    a group's loot configuration changes or during group creation to ensure proper
    initialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed is valid and not null, as calling
    this method on an invalid group could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This
    method modifies group state directly, so it should only be invoked in appropriate
    contexts such as after group formation or configuration changes.
