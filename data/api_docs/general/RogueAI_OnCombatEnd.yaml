documentation:
  brief: Handles cleanup and state reset when a rogue's combat session ends
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is invoked when a RogueAI-controlled unit exits
    combat mode. This method performs necessary cleanup operations such as resetting
    combat-related flags, clearing target references, and ensuring the AI returns
    to its default non-combat behavior. It is typically called by the core game loop
    when the unit's combat state transitions from active to inactive. The method ensures
    that any temporary combat states or actions are properly reset to maintain proper
    AI behavior and prevent stale data issues during subsequent encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in custom rogue AI
    code: "class MyRogueAI : public RogueAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd() override\
      \ {\n        // Custom cleanup logic\n        RogueAI::OnCombatEnd();\n    \
      \    // Additional reset operations\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI lifecycle and should not be called
    manually unless implementing a custom AI behavior. The base implementation handles
    core cleanup tasks, but derived classes may override it to add additional functionality.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from game logic unless you understand
    the implications. It's designed to be invoked automatically by the TrinityCore
    framework when combat ends.
