documentation:
  brief: Resets all spell charges in the SpellHistory object to their default state.
  description: The ResetAllCharges method clears all tracked spell charges within
    the SpellHistory class, effectively resetting the cooldown and usage tracking
    for all spells that have charge mechanics. This is typically used when a player's
    abilities need to be restored to their initial state, such as after certain game
    events, level-ups, or when switching forms/stances. The method ensures that all
    previously accumulated charges are cleared and any associated cooldowns are reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting spell charges for a player
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->GetSpellHistory()->ResetAllCharges();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects all spell charges in the
    history, not just specific ones. It may have performance implications if called
    frequently during high-frequency gameplay events.
  warnings: Calling this method will immediately reset all spell charge tracking,
    which could interfere with ongoing game mechanics or player expectations if not
    timed properly.
