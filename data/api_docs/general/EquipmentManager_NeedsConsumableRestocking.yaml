  class: EquipmentManager
  method: NeedsConsumableRestocking
  signature: bool EquipmentManager::NeedsConsumableRestocking(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's equipment requires consumable restocking.
  description: The NeedsConsumableRestocking method evaluates the current state of
    a player's equipment to determine if any consumable items (such as arrows, bullets,
    or other usage-based items) need to be replenished. This check is typically performed
    during player updates or when accessing inventory systems to ensure that players
    have sufficient resources for continued gameplay. The method may consider various
    factors including the type of equipment equipped, the quantity of consumables
    in the inventory, and the player's current activity or location.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to identify which specific player's equipment
      state should be checked for consumable restocking needs.
  returns: Returns true if the player's equipment requires consumable restocking,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that one or more consumable
    items are either missing or below a defined threshold, requiring replenishment.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nbool needsRestock = equipmentManager->NeedsConsumableRestocking(&playerId);\n\
      if (needsRestock)\n{\n    // Trigger consumable restocking logic\n    player->AddItem(ItemTemplate,\
      \ quantity);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger inventory management system and may
    be called frequently during gameplay updates. It's important to note that the
    actual implementation details regarding how 'needs restocking' is determined (e.g.,
    thresholds, item types) are not specified in this documentation.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed to this method is valid and represents
    an active player. Passing an invalid or null pointer could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
