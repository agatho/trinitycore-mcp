  class: KitingUtils
  method: IsTerrainSuitableForKiting
  signature: bool KitingUtils::IsTerrainSuitableForKiting(const int & center, float
    radius)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the terrain at a given location is suitable for kiting
    behavior.
  description: The IsTerrainSuitableForKiting method evaluates the navigability and
    layout of the terrain around a specified center point to determine if it supports
    effective kiting mechanics. This typically involves checking for sufficient open
    space, appropriate elevation changes, and absence of obstacles that would impede
    movement or line-of-sight during kiting. The method considers a defined radius
    around the center point to assess overall suitability. It is commonly used by
    AI systems or game logic to make decisions about positioning, movement patterns,
    or combat strategy in environments where kiting (maintaining distance while attacking)
    is a viable tactic.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: An integer identifier representing the center point of the area to
      evaluate. This value likely corresponds to a specific location within the game
      world, such as a node ID or coordinate reference.
  - name: radius
    description: A floating-point value defining the radius around the center point
      to assess for kiting suitability. Larger radii will encompass more area and
      may affect performance.
  returns: Returns true if the terrain within the specified radius from the center
    is deemed suitable for kiting; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "bool isSuitable = KitingUtils::IsTerrainSuitableForKiting(12345, 10.0f);\n\
      if (isSuitable)\n{\n    // Proceed with kiting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void AIUnit::Update()\n{\n    if (KitingUtils::IsTerrainSuitableForKiting(this->GetTargetPosition(),\
      \ 15.0f))\n    {\n        this->SetMovementBehavior(MovementBehavior::Kiting);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        this->SetMovementBehavior(MovementBehavior::Melee);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial queries or terrain analysis using internal
    TrinityCore navigation systems. Performance may be impacted by large radius values
    or frequent calls in high-frequency contexts such as AI update loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'center' parameter refers to a valid location within the
    game world; invalid locations could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
