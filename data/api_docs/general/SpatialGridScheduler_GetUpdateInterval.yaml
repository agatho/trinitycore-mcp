  class: SpatialGridScheduler
  method: GetUpdateInterval
  signature: uint32 SpatialGridScheduler::GetUpdateInterval() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the update interval in milliseconds used by the spatial grid scheduler
    for processing updates.
  description: The GetUpdateInterval method retrieves the time interval, measured
    in milliseconds, that determines how frequently the SpatialGridScheduler processes
    and updates its managed objects. This interval is crucial for maintaining performance
    and synchronization within the game world's spatial grid system. The value returned
    represents the fixed delay between consecutive update cycles, ensuring consistent
    processing frequency across all grid cells. This method is typically used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to control the timing of grid-based object updates
    such as NPC movement, player visibility checks, and other spatially-dependent
    behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the update interval in milliseconds. This indicates
    how often the scheduler performs its update cycle for spatial grid objects.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Update Interval for Debugging
    code: 'uint32 interval = scheduler.GetUpdateInterval();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "SpatialGridScheduler update interval: %u ms", interval);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Interval in Custom Grid Logic
    code: "uint32 currentInterval = scheduler.GetUpdateInterval();\nif (currentInterval\
      \ > 100)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(\"misc\", \"Scheduler interval is unusually high:\
      \ %u ms\", currentInterval);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned value is typically set during scheduler initialization and should remain
    constant throughout the object's lifetime unless explicitly modified by internal
    framework code.
