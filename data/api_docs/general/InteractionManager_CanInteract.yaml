  class: InteractionManager
  method: CanInteract
  signature: bool InteractionManager::CanInteract(Player * bot, GameObject * go) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can interact with a game object based on proximity,
    state, and game rules.
  description: The CanInteract method evaluates if a given player is able to interact
    with a specified game object. This includes checking distance thresholds, object
    visibility, player state (such as being dead or ghost), and any relevant game
    mechanics like quest requirements or object cooldowns. The method ensures that
    interactions are only allowed when all necessary conditions are met, preventing
    invalid or unintended interactions in the game world. It is commonly used by AI
    systems and interaction logic to validate potential actions before executing them.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object attempting to interact with the game
      object. Must be a valid player instance; null pointers will result in undefined
      behavior.
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that the player is trying to interact with.
      Must be a valid game object instance; null pointers will result in undefined
      behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the player can successfully interact with the game object,
    false otherwise. The method returns false when the player is out of range, the
    object is not interactable, or other game rules prevent interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interaction Check
    code: "if (interactionManager->CanInteract(player, gameObject)) {\n    // Perform\
      \ interaction logic\n    player->SendGameObjectCustomAnim(gameObject->GetGUID());\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid interaction attempt\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You cannot interact with that object.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    bool ShouldInteract(Player* bot, GameObject*\
      \ go) {\n        return interactionManager->CanInteract(bot, go);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs several checks including distance calculation, object
    state validation, and player condition verification. It's optimized for frequent
    calls but may involve expensive operations such as distance calculations or database
    lookups depending on implementation details. The method should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers to this method as it will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that both player and game object are valid before
    calling this method. Be aware that the result may change dynamically due to state
    changes (e.g., player moving out of range).
