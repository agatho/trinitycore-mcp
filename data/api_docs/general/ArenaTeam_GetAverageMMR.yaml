  method: GetAverageMMR
  signature: uint32 ArenaTeam::GetAverageMMR(Group * group) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average Matchmaking Rating (MMR) of all members
    in the specified group.
  description: The GetAverageMMR method computes the average Matchmaking Rating for
    all players currently in the provided group. This value is typically used in arena
    team matchmaking systems to balance teams based on player skill levels. The method
    iterates through each member of the group, retrieves their individual MMR, sums
    these values, and divides by the total number of members. It's important to note
    that this calculation assumes all group members are eligible for arena play and
    have valid MMR data. If the group is empty or contains no valid players with MMR
    data, the method may return 0 or an undefined value depending on implementation
    details.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to a Group object containing the members whose average
      MMR will be calculated. This parameter must not be null and should represent
      a valid group with active arena team members.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated average Matchmaking
    Rating of all players in the specified group. If no valid players are found or
    if the group is empty, returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate Average MMR for a Group
    code: 'ArenaTeam* team = sObjectMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);

      Group* group = team->GetMembers();

      uint32 avgMMR = team->GetAverageMMR(group);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Average MMR of team members: %u", avgMMR);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Average MMR for Team Balancing
    code: "ArenaTeam* team1 = sObjectMgr->GetArenaTeamById(1001);\nArenaTeam* team2\
      \ = sObjectMgr->GetArenaTeamById(1002);\nGroup* group1 = team1->GetMembers();\n\
      Group* group2 = team2->GetMembers();\nuint32 avgMMR1 = team1->GetAverageMMR(group1);\n\
      uint32 avgMMR2 = team2->GetAverageMMR(group2);\nif (abs((int32)(avgMMR1 - avgMMR2))\
      \ > 100) {\n    // Teams are too unbalanced, consider reassigning players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires that all group members have valid MMR data stored in
    their player records. The calculation is performed at the time of method call
    and does not cache results. Performance may be impacted when dealing with large
    groups or frequent calls, especially during high-traffic server periods.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and contains
    members before calling to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. The method
    assumes all players in the group are active arena team members; otherwise, results
    may be inaccurate.
