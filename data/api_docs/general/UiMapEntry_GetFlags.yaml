  signature: int UiMapEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a UI map entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    flags that define various properties and behaviors of the UI map entry. These
    flags are typically used to control how the map is displayed, whether it's available
    in certain contexts, or if special interactions are enabled for the map. The returned
    value should be interpreted using bitwise operations to check individual flag
    states. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call multiple
    times.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the combined flags of the UI map entry. Each bit
    in the integer corresponds to a specific property or behavior, such as visibility,
    interactability, or map type. The exact meaning of each flag must be determined
    by referencing the game's flag definitions or documentation.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a UI map is visible
    code: "UiMapEntry* entry = sUiMapDB2->GetEntry(1234);\nif (entry && (entry->GetFlags()\
      \ & 0x1)) {\n    // Map is visible\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combine and test multiple flags
    code: "UiMapEntry* entry = sUiMapDB2->GetEntry(5678);\nint flags = entry->GetFlags();\n\
      if ((flags & 0x2) && !(flags & 0x4)) {\n    // Map is interactive but not locked\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flag values are typically defined in the game's database or client-side
    constants. Developers should be aware that flag meanings may change between patches
    and should verify against current TrinityCore documentation or source code if
    exact behavior is required.
  warnings: Do not assume fixed bit positions for flags without verifying against
    the current game version, as these can vary between different versions of World
    of Warcraft or TrinityCore. Also, bitwise operations must be used carefully to
    avoid unintended behavior.
