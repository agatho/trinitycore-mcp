  class: DefensiveBehaviorManager
  method: CoordinateExternalDefensives
  signature: void DefensiveBehaviorManager::CoordinateExternalDefensives()
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates external defensive behaviors for units within the manager's scope.
  description: The CoordinateExternalDefensives method manages and synchronizes defensive
    actions performed by external entities or AI-controlled units in proximity to
    the manager's target. This method ensures that defensive behaviors are properly
    aligned with the overall tactical state of the unit group, preventing conflicting
    actions and maintaining coordinated responses to threats. It typically evaluates
    the current threat level, unit positioning, and available defensive resources
    to determine optimal defensive coordination strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  m_defensiveManager->CoordinateExternalDefensives();\n    // ... continue\
      \ with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may involve
    performance considerations when dealing with large groups of units. It assumes
    that the manager has been properly initialized with valid target units and threat
    data.
  warnings: Improper initialization of the DefensiveBehaviorManager or inconsistent
    threat state updates can lead to ineffective defensive coordination. Ensure all
    managed units are within the scope before calling this method.
