documentation:
  brief: Forfeits the current battle pet battle for the player
  description: The ForfeitBattle method allows a player to surrender their current
    battle pet battle. This method typically transitions the battle state to a forfeit
    condition, ending the battle and potentially awarding penalties or rewards based
    on game rules. The method may only be called when a battle is actively in progress,
    and it usually updates the player's battle pet statistics accordingly. It returns
    true if the forfeiture was successfully processed, or false if the operation failed
    due to invalid state or other conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID)
      who is forfeiting the battle. This parameter is likely used internally to verify
      ownership and process the forfeiture correctly.
  returns: Returns true if the battle was successfully forfeited, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that no active battle exists for the player
    or that the player does not have permission to forfeit the battle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ForfeitBattle
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nbool result = battlePetManager->ForfeitBattle(&playerId);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Battle successfully forfeited\n    printf(\"Battle forfeited\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to forfeit the battle\n   \
      \ printf(\"Failed to forfeit battle\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal battle state tracking and may
    update player statistics or pet records. It should only be called when a battle
    is in progress to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of an active battle may result in undefined
    behavior or failure to process the forfeiture correctly. Ensure that the player
    has an active battle before invoking this method.
