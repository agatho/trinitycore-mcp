documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timers for the Marksmanship Hunter's abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown tracking of a Marksmanship Hunter. This method is typically
    called during each update cycle to decrement active cooldowns and handle the activation
    of abilities that were previously on cooldown. It ensures that abilities can be
    used only after their respective cooldown periods have expired, maintaining game
    balance and proper ability usage mechanics. The method processes all relevant
    hunter abilities including those specific to the Marksmanship specialization such
    as Aimed Shot, Steady Shot, and other cooldown-based talents.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Cooldowns Call
    code: "void Update()\n{\n    // Called every game tick\n    _hunter->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void WorldSession::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        if (player->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER && player->getClass()\
      \ == CLASS_HUNTER)\n        {\n            if (MarksmanshipHunter* hunter =\
      \ dynamic_cast<MarksmanshipHunter*>(player->GetHunter()))\n            {\n \
      \               hunter->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n            }\n        }\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop and should
    be called with the time delta (diff) parameter representing milliseconds since
    last update. The implementation internally manages a collection of cooldowns and
    updates them accordingly. Performance-wise, this method should execute quickly
    as it's called frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper context or game state
    management. It's designed to be called as part of the regular update cycle and
    not for manual triggering. Improper usage may lead to incorrect cooldown behavior
    or game balance issues.
