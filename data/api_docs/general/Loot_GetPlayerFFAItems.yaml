documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of free-for-all items available for a player to loot.
  description: The GetPlayerFFAItems method retrieves the number of free-for-all (FFA)
    loot items that are available for a specific player to claim. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, FFA loot refers to items that can be looted by any player who is
    in the same group or raid as the creature that dropped them, without being assigned
    to a specific player. This method is typically used during loot distribution to
    determine how many items are available for general pickup. The returned value
    represents the count of such items and is usually used in conjunction with other
    loot-related methods to manage the distribution process.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer reference representing the number of free-for-all items available
    for the player to loot. A value of 0 indicates no FFA items are available, while
    a positive value indicates the count of items that can be looted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();\nint ffaItemCount = loot->GetPlayerFFAItems();\n\
      if (ffaItemCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process FFA items\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ has %d FFA items available.\", ffaItemCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the loot system in TrinityCore and should be used
    carefully during loot processing. The returned reference may point to an internal
    counter that gets modified as items are looted, so it's important to use the value
    immediately after calling this method if the state might change.
  warnings: The return value is a const reference to an internal integer. Modifying
    the value through this reference directly can lead to unexpected behavior. Always
    treat the returned value as read-only and avoid storing references to it for extended
    periods.
