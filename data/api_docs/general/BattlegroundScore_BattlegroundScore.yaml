  class: BattlegroundScore
  method: BattlegroundScore
  signature: void BattlegroundScore::BattlegroundScore(int playerGuid, int team, const
    int * pvpStatIds)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a battleground score entry for a player with specified PvP statistics.
  description: The BattlegroundScore constructor method initializes a new battleground
    score entry for a player within a battleground. It associates the player's unique
    identifier (GUID), their team, and an array of PvP statistic IDs that track various
    performance metrics during the match. This method is typically called when a player
    joins or spawns in a battleground to set up their initial scoring data structure.
    The pvpStatIds parameter allows for flexible tracking of different statistics
    such as kills, deaths, honor gained, and other relevant metrics depending on the
    battleground type.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player participating in the battleground.
      This value is used to track individual player performance throughout the match.
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) that the player
      belongs to within the battleground context.
  - name: pvpStatIds
    description: Pointer to an array of integer identifiers representing different
      PvP statistics tracked during the battleground. The size and content of this
      array depends on the specific battleground type and its scoring requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize battleground score for a player
    code: 'BattlegroundScore score(12345, 0, pvpStats);

      // Initializes a score entry for player with GUID 12345 on Alliance team'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground scoring system and should
    not be called directly by external code. The pvpStatIds array must contain valid
    statistic identifiers that match the expected format for the current battleground
    type.
