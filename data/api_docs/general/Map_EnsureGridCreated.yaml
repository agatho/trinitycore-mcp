  class: Map
  method: EnsureGridCreated
  signature: void Map::EnsureGridCreated(const int & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that a grid is created for the specified map coordinate.
  description: The EnsureGridCreated method guarantees that a grid has been initialized
    for the given map coordinate. This method is typically used internally by the
    TrinityCore server to manage memory and object placement within the game world.
    It ensures that when a player or object moves into a particular grid location,
    the necessary data structures are already in place to handle entities within that
    area. The method likely checks if the grid exists and creates it if it does not,
    preventing potential null pointer exceptions or missing grid data during world
    updates.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The coordinate value representing the grid position on the map. This
      is typically an integer value that corresponds to a specific grid location within
      the map's coordinate system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in map initialization
    code: "void InitializeMapGrid(Map* map, int gridX, int gridY) {\n    map->EnsureGridCreated(gridX);\n\
      \    map->EnsureGridCreated(gridY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage during player movement
    code: "void HandlePlayerMovement(Player* player, int newX, int newY) {\n    Map*\
      \ map = player->GetMap();\n    if (map) {\n        map->EnsureGridCreated(newX);\n\
      \        map->EnsureGridCreated(newY);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal grid management system and should not
    typically be called directly by addon developers. It's designed to maintain consistency
    in the game world's spatial data structures and is usually invoked automatically
    during map operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid coordinates may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory corruption. The parameter must represent a valid grid coordinate within
    the bounds of the map's grid system.
