  method: Reset
  signature: void HunterCombatMetrics::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all combat metrics and statistics for the hunter's current combat
    session.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated combat data, including hit
    counts, damage dealt, critical strikes, and other performance metrics specific
    to the hunter class. This function is typically invoked when beginning a new combat
    encounter or when resetting the hunter's combat state. It ensures that previous
    combat statistics do not carry over into subsequent encounters, providing accurate
    tracking for each individual fight. The method does not affect the hunter's overall
    character stats or permanent abilities; it only resets temporary combat-related
    data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Reset
    code: 'HunterCombatMetrics metrics;

      metrics.Reset(); // Clears all current combat statistics

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before initiating a new combat encounter to
    ensure clean metric tracking. It is generally not thread-safe and should only
    be used from the main game thread or within a controlled execution context.
  warnings: Calling Reset() during an active combat session may lead to inconsistent
    metrics if other systems are still referencing old data. Ensure all related combat
    events have concluded before calling this method.
