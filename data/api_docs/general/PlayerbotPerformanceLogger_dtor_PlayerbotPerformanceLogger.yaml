documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerbotPerformanceLogger instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the PlayerbotPerformanceLogger class is responsible
    for releasing any allocated memory or resources held by the logger instance. This
    method is automatically invoked when a PlayerbotPerformanceLogger object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's player
    bot system, this logger likely tracks performance metrics for AI behaviors and
    decision-making processes. The destructor ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory
    leaks and maintain system stability during bot operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of logger instance
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    PlayerbotPerformanceLogger logger;\n    // ...\
      \ perform logging operations ...\n    // logger is automatically destroyed here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that no references to the logger exist
    after it goes out of scope, as attempting to use a destroyed logger may lead to
    undefined behavior.
