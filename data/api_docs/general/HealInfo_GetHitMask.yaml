  class: HealInfo
  method: GetHitMask
  signature: uint32 HealInfo::GetHitMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the hit mask indicating which targets were successfully healed in
    a healing event.
  description: The GetHitMask method retrieves a bitmask that represents the status
    of individual targets within a healing action. Each bit in the returned uint32
    corresponds to a specific target, with set bits indicating that the heal successfully
    affected that target. This is commonly used in combat logging and damage/heal
    processing systems to track which units received healing during a multi-target
    heal spell or ability. The method does not modify any internal state and is typically
    called after a healing event has been processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value where each bit represents the hit status of a target in
    the healing event. A set bit (1) indicates that the corresponding target was successfully
    healed, while a cleared bit (0) means the target was missed or otherwise not affected
    by the heal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Heal Event Processing
    code: "void HandleHealEvent(HealInfo* info)\n{\n    uint32 hitMask = info->GetHitMask();\n\
      \    // Process each target based on the hit mask\n    for (uint8 i = 0; i <\
      \ MAX_TARGETS; ++i)\n    {\n        if (hitMask & (1 << i))\n        {\n   \
      \         // Target i was successfully healed\n            // Perform healing\
      \ logic here\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The hit mask is typically generated during spell processing and reflects
    the outcome of hit chance calculations, resistances, and other combat mechanics.
    It's important to note that this method should only be called after a healing
    event has been fully processed, as the mask may not be valid until then.
