  class: BIH
  method: readFromFile
  signature: bool BIH::readFromFile(FILE * rf)
documentation:
  brief: Reads BIH (Bounding Interval Hierarchy) data from a file pointer.
  description: The readFromFile method loads bounding interval hierarchy data from
    a specified file stream into the BIH object. This functionality is typically used
    for loading precomputed spatial data structures that optimize collision detection
    and visibility checks in the game world. The method expects the file to contain
    properly formatted BIH data, including node information and bounding volumes.
    It performs validation on the loaded data to ensure structural integrity before
    completing the read operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the file was successfully read and parsed without errors;
    otherwise returns false if the operation failed due to invalid data, file access
    issues, or parsing errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic BIH File Reading
    code: "FILE* file = fopen(\"map.bih\", \"rb\");\nif (file != nullptr) {\n    BIH\
      \ bih;\n    if (bih.readFromFile(file)) {\n        // BIH data successfully\
      \ loaded\n        printf(\"BIH data loaded successfully\\n\");\n    } else {\n\
      \        // Handle read failure\n        printf(\"Failed to load BIH data\\\
      n\");\n    }\n    fclose(file);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the file pointer is already opened in binary mode and
    positioned at the beginning of the BIH data. The implementation may perform internal
    validation checks on the loaded data structure to prevent corruption or invalid
    memory access.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unopened file pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure the FILE* is valid before
    calling readFromFile.
