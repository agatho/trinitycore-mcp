documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the total role score for a player based on their current
    performance metrics.
  description: The CalculateTotalScore method computes the aggregate role score for
    a player by combining individual role scores from various gameplay metrics such
    as damage dealt, healing done, and support contributions. This method is typically
    invoked during raid encounters or when evaluating player performance for gear
    recommendations and achievement tracking. The calculation takes into account the
    player's class-specific role weights and current encounter difficulty modifiers
    to ensure accurate scoring across different game contexts.

  - title: Basic Usage in Player Performance Evaluation
    code: 'RoleScore playerScore;

      playerScore.CalculateTotalScore();

      uint32 total = playerScore.GetTotalScore(); // Retrieve the calculated score'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state variables and should only be called after
    all individual role scores have been properly initialized. The calculation is
    performed in-place and does not return a value, making it suitable for use in
    performance-critical scenarios where direct state modification is preferred.
