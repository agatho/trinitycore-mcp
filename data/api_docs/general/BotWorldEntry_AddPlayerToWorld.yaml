  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::AddPlayerToWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Adds a bot player to the game world and initializes their presence in the
    server.
  description: The AddPlayerToWorld method is responsible for integrating a bot player
    into the active game world environment. This method typically handles the necessary
    setup steps such as initializing the player's position, creating the appropriate
    world objects, and ensuring the bot is properly registered with the server's world
    management systems. It may also perform checks to ensure the bot can be safely
    added to the world without conflicts or violations of game rules. The method returns
    a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot player was successfully added to the world and
    initialized correctly; otherwise, returns false if an error occurred during the
    process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotWorldEntry* entry = new BotWorldEntry();\nbool success = entry->AddPlayerToWorld();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot successfully added to world\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves synchronization with the server's main thread
    and may have performance implications if called frequently. It should only be
    invoked when the bot is fully initialized and ready to enter the world.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already active bot player may result in undefined
    behavior or duplicate entries in the game world. Ensure proper state management
    before invoking this function.
