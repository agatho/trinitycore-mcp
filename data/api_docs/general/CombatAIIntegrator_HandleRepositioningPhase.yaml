  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: HandleRepositioningPhase
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::HandleRepositioningPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Executes the repositioning phase logic for combat AI integration.
  description: The HandleRepositioningPhase method manages the tactical positioning
    behavior of an AI-controlled unit during combat. This method evaluates the current
    combat state, determines optimal positioning strategies based on target distance
    and threat levels, and initiates movement adjustments to improve engagement effectiveness.
    It typically involves calculating new positions, checking for obstacles, and executing
    pathfinding routines to reposition the unit for better tactical advantage. The
    method is designed to be called during the AI's update cycle when repositioning
    decisions are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  if (m_repositioningRequired)\n        m_combatAIIntegrator->HandleRepositioningPhase();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the AI unit is actively engaged in
    combat. It performs pathfinding operations which may impact performance if called
    too frequently. The method assumes that the AI unit has valid target information
    and that movement capabilities are properly initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat context may result in undefined
    behavior or failed positioning attempts. Ensure that the AI unit's movement state
    is valid before invocation to prevent potential pathfinding errors.
