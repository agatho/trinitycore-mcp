  class: TempSummon
  method: IsSharingTotemSlotWith
  signature: bool TempSummon::IsSharingTotemSlotWith(int objectGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if this temporary summon shares a totem slot with the specified object
    GUID.
  description: The IsSharingTotemSlotWith method determines whether the current temporary
    summon (such as a totem or summoned creature) shares the same totem slot index
    with another game object identified by its GUID. This is primarily used in the
    context of totem mechanics in World of Warcraft, where multiple totems can occupy
    the same slot if they are of the same type or have specific relationships. The
    method compares internal totem slot data stored within the summon's state against
    the provided GUID to make this determination.
  parameters:
  - name: objectGuid
    description: The GUID of the object to check for shared totem slot membership.
      This should be a valid GameObject or Creature GUID that represents a totem or
      similar summoned entity.
  returns: Returns true if this temporary summon and the specified object share the
    same totem slot; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a totem shares a slot with another totem
    code: "if (tempSummon->IsSharingTotemSlotWith(otherTotemGuid)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ logic for shared slot\n    sLog->outString(\"Totems share the same slot.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in totem management system
    code: "void HandleTotemPlacement(Player* player, TempSummon* newTotem) {\n   \
      \ for (auto& entry : player->GetTotems()) {\n        if (newTotem->IsSharingTotemSlotWith(entry.second->GetGUID()))\
      \ {\n            // Replace existing totem in slot\n            player->RemoveTotem(entry.first);\n\
      \            break;\n        }\n    }\n    player->AddTotem(newTotem);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal totem slot tracking within the TempSummon
    class. It is typically called during totem placement or removal logic, and assumes
    that both entities involved have been properly initialized with totem slot information.
    The GUID parameter must refer to a valid game object that could potentially share
    totem slots.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID refers to an actual totem or summon that
    supports totem slot sharing. Using invalid or uninitialized GUIDs may result in
    undefined behavior or incorrect comparisons.
