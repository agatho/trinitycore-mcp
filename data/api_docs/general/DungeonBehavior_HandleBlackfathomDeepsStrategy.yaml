  signature: void DungeonBehavior::HandleBlackfathomDeepsStrategy(Group * group, uint32
    encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the Blackfathom Deeps dungeon strategy for a given group and encounter
    ID
  description: The HandleBlackfathomDeepsStrategy method is responsible for implementing
    the AI behavior and tactical decisions specific to the Blackfathom Deeps dungeon
    instance. This method processes the current encounter within the dungeon based
    on the provided group and encounter identifier, determining appropriate actions
    such as positioning, spell casting, or movement patterns for the NPCs or players
    involved. It integrates with the broader DungeonBehavior system to manage complex
    encounters in the underwater raid instance. The method operates under the assumption
    that the group has been properly initialized and that the encounterId corresponds
    to a valid Blackfathom Deeps encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group currently
      engaged in the Blackfathom Deeps dungeon. This parameter is essential for determining
      group composition, member roles, and coordinating group-wide actions during
      encounters.
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the current encounter within Blackfathom Deeps.
      This value determines which specific boss or event behavior should be executed,
      such as 1 for Gelihast, 2 for Lord Aurius Rivendare, etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, uint32 encounterId)\n\
      {\n    HandleBlackfathomDeepsStrategy(group, encounterId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom dungeon behavior
    code: "class MyBlackfathomBehavior : public DungeonBehavior\n{\npublic:\n    void\
      \ ProcessEncounter(Group* group, uint32 encounterId) override\n    {\n     \
      \   if (encounterId == 1)\n            HandleBlackfathomDeepsStrategy(group,\
      \ encounterId);\n        else\n            DefaultDungeonStrategy(group, encounterId);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's dungeon AI framework and should
    be called only when a group enters Blackfathom Deeps. The implementation likely
    includes logic for handling different encounter phases, managing NPC positioning,
    and coordinating group tactics. Developers should ensure that the group parameter
    is valid and that the encounterId corresponds to an actual encounter within the
    Blackfathom Deeps instance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid group or encounterId values may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all encounters are properly
    initialized before calling this method, and verify that the dungeon instance is
    correctly set up for Blackfathom Deeps mechanics.
