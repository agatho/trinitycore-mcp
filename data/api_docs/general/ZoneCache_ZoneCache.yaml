  signature: void ZoneCache::ZoneCache(uint32 zoneId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ZoneCache instance for the specified zone ID.
  description: The ZoneCache constructor initializes a caching mechanism for zone-related
    data. This method sets up internal structures to efficiently manage and retrieve
    information about a specific game zone identified by its unique zone ID. The cache
    may store various zone properties such as terrain data, spawn points, quest information,
    or NPC placements depending on the implementation details. This initialization
    is typically called when a player enters a new zone or when zone-specific data
    needs to be loaded for processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize ZoneCache for Eastern Kingdoms
    code: ZoneCache cache(141); // Initialize cache for Eastern Kingdoms zone
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger caching system that improves performance
    by reducing redundant database queries when accessing zone-specific data. The
    actual implementation details may vary based on how TrinityCore manages zone data
    internally.
