  brief: Resets all player bot statistics to their default values.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and reinitializes all accumulated
    statistics for a player bot, including combat metrics, quest completions, and
    other gameplay data. This function is typically invoked when a bot's session is
    reset or when transitioning between different game states. It ensures that the
    bot starts with clean statistical data, which is essential for accurate performance
    tracking and consistent behavior across multiple sessions. The method does not
    require any parameters and performs its operation in-place on the current player
    bot instance.

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect ongoing gameplay
    metrics and analytics. It is recommended to use this function only during controlled
    reset scenarios, such as before starting a new bot session or after completing
    a major game event.
  warnings: Calling ResetStatistics during active gameplay may lead to inconsistent
    tracking of player performance data. Ensure that no active quests or combat activities
    are in progress when invoking this method.
