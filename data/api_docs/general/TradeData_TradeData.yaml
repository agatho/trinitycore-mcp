documentation:
  brief: Initializes a trade session between two players in the game.
  description: The TradeData constructor initializes a trade session between two Player
    objects, setting up the necessary data structures and state for handling item
    exchanges. This method is typically called when a player initiates a trade with
    another player, establishing the foundation for the trading mechanics within TrinityCore's
    framework. It prepares internal tracking of traded items, gold amounts, and ensures
    both players are properly registered in the trade process.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the first Player object initiating the trade
  - name: trader
    description: Pointer to the second Player object who is being traded with
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Initialization
    code: 'Player* player1 = ...;

      Player* player2 = ...;

      TradeData trade(player1, player2);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the game engine when
    a trade request is accepted. The TradeData object manages the state of the trade
    session until it's completed or cancelled.
