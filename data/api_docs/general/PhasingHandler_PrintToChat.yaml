  class: PhasingHandler
  method: PrintToChat
  signature: void PhasingHandler::PrintToChat(ChatHandler * chat, const WorldObject
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Prints phasing information to the chat handler for a specified target object.
  description: The PrintToChat method is used to output phasing-related information
    about a given WorldObject to a ChatHandler instance. This functionality is typically
    utilized for debugging or administrative purposes, allowing developers or GMs
    to inspect the phasing state of objects within the game world. The method leverages
    the provided ChatHandler to send formatted messages containing phasing details
    such as phase masks, phase groups, and related flags. It does not modify any internal
    state but solely outputs diagnostic information to the chat interface.
  parameters:
  - name: chat
    description: A pointer to the ChatHandler instance that will be used to send the
      output message to the player or console.
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the WorldObject whose phasing information will be printed.
      This can be any object in the game world such as a player, creature, or game
      object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Print phasing info for a player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      ChatHandler* chatHandler = ...; // Assume this is a valid chat handler pointer

      PhasingHandler::PrintToChat(chatHandler, targetPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Print phasing info for a creature
    code: 'Creature* targetCreature = ...; // Assume this is a valid creature pointer

      Player* player = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      PhasingHandler::PrintToChat(player->GetSession()->GetChatHandler(), targetCreature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in development and debugging environments.
    It may not be optimized for performance and should not be called frequently during
    normal gameplay operations. The output format depends on the ChatHandler's configuration
    and may vary based on permissions or debug settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided ChatHandler and WorldObject pointers are valid
    before calling this method, as passing null pointers will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. This function does not perform any access control checks;
    it simply prints the phasing data without verifying if the caller has permission
    to view such information.
