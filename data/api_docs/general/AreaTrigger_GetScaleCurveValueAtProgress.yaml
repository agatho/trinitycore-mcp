  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetScaleCurveValueAtProgress
  signature: float AreaTrigger::GetScaleCurveValueAtProgress(const int & scaleCurve,
    float x) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the scale value of an area trigger at a given progress
    along its scaling curve.
  description: The GetScaleCurveValueAtProgress method retrieves the scale factor
    for an area trigger based on a specified progress value along its defined scaling
    curve. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft to dynamically adjust the size
    or visual properties of area triggers (such as raid encounter effects) as they
    progress through their animation or duration. The method takes a curve identifier
    and a normalized progress value between 0.0 and 1.0, returning the corresponding
    scale factor that can be applied to modify the trigger's dimensions or other scalable
    attributes. This functionality is essential for creating dynamic and visually
    engaging game effects where objects grow, shrink, or change size over time.
  parameters:
  - name: scaleCurve
    description: An integer identifier referencing a specific scaling curve defined
      in the area trigger's configuration. This typically corresponds to an entry
      in the areatrigger_scaling_curve table or similar database structure.
  - name: x
    description: A normalized progress value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the
      position along the scaling curve. A value of 0.0 represents the start of the
      curve, while 1.0 represents the end.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the scale factor at the specified progress
    along the given scaling curve. This value is typically used to multiply the base
    scale of an area trigger to achieve the desired visual effect at that point in
    time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float currentScale = areaTrigger->GetScaleCurveValueAtProgress(5, 0.5f);

      // Returns the scale factor at mid-point (50%) of scaling curve 5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Scaling Application
    code: 'float progress = (float)currentTime / (float)totalDuration;

      float scale = areaTrigger->GetScaleCurveValueAtProgress(12, progress);

      areaTrigger->SetScale(scale);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-defined scaling curves stored in the database or
    game assets. The actual curve data may be defined using spline interpolation or
    discrete points. Ensure that the scaleCurve parameter references a valid curve
    ID to avoid undefined behavior. Performance is generally good as this is a lookup-based
    calculation, but repeated calls during high-frequency updates should be monitored.
  warnings: Incorrect scaleCurve IDs can lead to invalid results or crashes. The x
    parameter must be within [0.0, 1.0] range; values outside this range may produce
    unexpected scaling behavior or undefined results. This method assumes that the
    area trigger has been properly initialized with valid curve data.
