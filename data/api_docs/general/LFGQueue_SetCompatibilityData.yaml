  signature: void LFGQueue::SetCompatibilityData(const std::string & key, const LfgCompatibilityData
    & compatibles)
documentation:
  brief: Sets compatibility data for a specific key in the LFG queue system
  description: The SetCompatibilityData method stores or updates compatibility information
    associated with a given key within the Looking For Group (LFG) queue system. This
    data typically represents which players or groups are compatible with each other
    based on various criteria such as level, gear, and role preferences. The method
    allows the LFG system to efficiently match players together by maintaining up-to-date
    compatibility mappings. This is crucial for optimizing group formation in dungeons,
    raids, and other group content within World of Warcraft. The operation is typically
    performed internally by the LFG subsystem when processing player join requests
    or updating group composition.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A unique string identifier used to associate compatibility data with
      a specific context or group type in the LFG system
  - name: compatibles
    description: The LfgCompatibilityData object containing the compatibility mappings
      for players or groups related to the specified key
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Compatibility Data for a Dungeon Group
    code: 'LfgCompatibilityData compatData;

      // ... populate compatData with compatible player GUIDs ...

      LFGQueue::instance()->SetCompatibilityData("dungeon_1234", compatData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Compatibility Data for a Raid Group
    code: 'LfgCompatibilityData raidCompat;

      // ... populate raidCompat with raid-compatible player data ...

      LFGQueue::instance()->SetCompatibilityData("raid_5678", raidCompat);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG subsystem and should
    not be invoked directly from external code. The compatibility data stored here
    is used for matchmaking algorithms to ensure players are grouped appropriately
    based on their preferences and capabilities.
  warnings: Direct usage of this method outside of the LFG subsystem may lead to inconsistent
    matchmaking behavior or data corruption. Always use the proper LFG API methods
    for managing group queues and compatibility.
