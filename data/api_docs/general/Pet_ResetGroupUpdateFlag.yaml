  signature: void Pet::ResetGroupUpdateFlag()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the group update flag for the pet, clearing its need to send group-related
    updates.
  description: The ResetGroupUpdateFlag method clears the internal flag that indicates
    whether a pet requires sending group update information to nearby players. This
    flag is typically set when the pet's state changes in a way that should be communicated
    to the player's group members, such as when the pet's health, mana, or status
    effects change. Calling this method resets that flag, preventing unnecessary updates
    from being sent. It is commonly used during periodic update cycles or after sending
    required updates to ensure the pet does not repeatedly signal for group updates.

  returns: null

    code: "void Pet::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   if (m_updateFlags & PET_UPDATE_FLAG_GROUP)\n    {\n        SendUpdateToGroup();\n\
      \        ResetGroupUpdateFlag(); // Clear the flag after sending\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core update logic and should
    not usually be invoked directly unless implementing custom pet behavior. The group
    update flag is part of the pet's internal state management system.
