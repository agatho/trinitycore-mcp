  class: LootDistribution
  method: PredictLootNeeds
  signature: void LootDistribution::PredictLootNeeds(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts and distributes loot needs for group members based on current loot
    rules and player requirements.
  description: The PredictLootNeeds method calculates and applies loot distribution
    decisions for a given group, determining which players should receive specific
    items based on predefined loot rules such as need-before-greed, round-robin, or
    free-for-all. This method is typically invoked during the loot distribution process
    when a group member rolls for an item, and it updates internal state to reflect
    the predicted outcome of the loot roll. It ensures that loot is fairly distributed
    according to the group's configured loot master settings and individual player
    needs.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot distribution
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    LootDistribution\
      \ lootDist;\n    lootDist.PredictLootNeeds(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal loot distribution state and should only be
    called during active loot rolling sessions. It assumes that the group has been
    properly initialized with valid members and loot rules.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a proper loot session context may lead
    to incorrect loot predictions or undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is
    valid and contains at least one member before invoking this function.
