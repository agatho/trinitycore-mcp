  class: GuildAchievementMgr
  method: GetCriteriaByType
  signature: const CriteriaList & GuildAchievementMgr::GetCriteriaByType(int type,
    uint32 asset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of criteria associated with a specific achievement type
    and asset for the guild.
  description: The GetCriteriaByType method fetches all criteria entries that match
    the specified achievement type and asset identifier. This is used internally by
    the GuildAchievementMgr to manage and retrieve achievement-related data for guild
    members. The method returns a constant reference to a CriteriaList, which contains
    all matching criteria. It's typically invoked when processing guild achievements
    or determining progress towards specific guild-based accomplishments. The criteria
    list may be empty if no matching entries exist for the given type and asset combination.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The achievement type identifier used to filter criteria. This corresponds
      to predefined achievement types in the game's achievement system.
  - name: asset
    description: The asset identifier that further refines the criteria selection.
      This could represent a specific item, quest, or other in-game object related
      to the achievement.
  returns: A constant reference to a CriteriaList containing all criteria entries
    matching the provided type and asset parameters. Returns an empty list if no matching
    criteria are found.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve criteria for a specific achievement type
    code: "const auto& criteriaList = guildAchievementMgr.GetCriteriaByType(ACHIEVEMENT_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE,\
      \ 12345);\nfor (const auto& criterion : criteriaList) {\n    // Process each\
      \ matching criterion\n    printf(\"Criterion ID: %u\\n\", criterion.id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if any criteria exist before processing
    code: "const auto& criteria = guildAchievementMgr.GetCriteriaByType(ACHIEVEMENT_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST,\
      \ 67890);\nif (!criteria.empty()) {\n    // Proceed with achievement validation\
      \ logic\n    for (const auto& criterion : criteria) {\n        // Validate each\
      \ criterion against player progress\n    }\n} else {\n    // Handle case where\
      \ no criteria are defined\n    printf(\"No criteria found for this achievement\
      \ type\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation using the provided type and asset
    parameters. It is recommended to cache results when frequently accessed to improve
    performance. The returned CriteriaList reference should not be modified directly
    as it points to internal data structures managed by GuildAchievementMgr.
  warnings: Modifying the returned CriteriaList directly may cause unexpected behavior
    or data corruption since it references internal data. Always use const references
    and avoid direct modification of the returned list.
