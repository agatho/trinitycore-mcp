api:
  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GetBotProfile
  signature: BotPerformanceProfile BotPerformanceAnalytics::GetBotProfile(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the performance profile data for a specified bot using its unique
    identifier.
  description: The GetBotProfile method fetches and returns a BotPerformanceProfile
    object that contains detailed analytics and performance metrics associated with
    a specific bot identified by its GUID. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's
    bot management system to retrieve historical or real-time data about how a particular
    bot is performing within the game environment. The returned profile includes information
    such as activity levels, response times, behavior patterns, and other relevant
    metrics that help administrators or developers monitor and optimize bot performance.
    It is important to note that this method assumes the bot exists in the system
    and has been properly initialized with performance tracking enabled.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: A unique 32-bit identifier (GUID) representing the specific bot for
      which the performance profile is being requested. This value must correspond
      to an existing bot instance in the TrinityCore database or runtime environment.
  returns: A BotPerformanceProfile object containing comprehensive performance data
    for the specified bot. If no matching bot is found, the method may return an empty
    or default-initialized profile, depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Print Bot Profile
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceProfile profile = analytics.GetBotProfile(botGuid);

      std::cout << "Bot Name: " << profile.GetName() << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Avg Response Time: " << profile.GetAverageResponseTime() << "ms"
      << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Bot Profile Validity Before Use
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nBotPerformanceProfile profile = analytics.GetBotProfile(botGuid);\n\
      if (!profile.IsEmpty()) {\n    // Process valid profile data\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Active Bots: \" << profile.GetActiveBots() << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle invalid or missing profile\n    std::cerr << \"No performance\
      \ data found for bot GUID: \" << botGuid << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database lookups or cached data retrieval depending
    on the implementation. Performance considerations should be taken into account
    when calling this method frequently in high-frequency scenarios. The returned
    BotPerformanceProfile object is expected to be thread-safe if used across multiple
    threads, but developers should verify the underlying implementation.
  warnings: Calling GetBotProfile with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or return a default profile. Always validate that the bot
    exists before calling this method if strict error handling is required. Additionally,
    excessive calls to this method can lead to performance degradation due to potential
    database access overhead.
