  signature: void ArenaAI::ArenaAI()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ArenaAI instance with default settings and behavior for
    arena combat.
  description: The ArenaAI constructor initializes a new instance of the ArenaAI class,
    setting up internal state variables and default configurations required for managing
    AI behavior in arena environments. This method is typically called during the
    creation of AI-controlled NPCs or players within an arena context. It establishes
    baseline parameters such as combat strategies, movement patterns, and targeting
    behaviors specific to arena-style PvP encounters. The initialization process ensures
    that the AI component is properly configured before being attached to a creature
    or player object for active use in arena matches.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an ArenaAI instance
    code: 'ArenaAI* ai = new ArenaAI();

      // The AI is now initialized and ready to be attached to a creature

      // for arena combat behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object instantiation. It does
    not perform any runtime initialization that would be needed after the object has
    been created. The ArenaAI class typically requires additional setup through other
    methods like SetCreature() or similar before it can be effectively used in combat
    scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on existing objects; it should only
    be used during new object creation. Improper usage may lead to undefined behavior
    or memory corruption if the AI system is not properly initialized with required
    dependencies.
