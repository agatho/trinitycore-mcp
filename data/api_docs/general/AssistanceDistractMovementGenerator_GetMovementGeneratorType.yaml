  method: GetMovementGeneratorType
  signature: int AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator::GetMovementGeneratorType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for the AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique integer identifier
    associated with the AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator class. This identifier
    is used internally by the TrinityCore AI system to categorize and manage different
    types of movement behaviors for creatures. The method is typically called during
    AI decision-making processes to determine how a creature should move in response
    to specific stimuli, such as being distracted or assisting allies. It serves as
    part of the movement generator hierarchy that controls NPC behavior patterns within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type constant for AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator.
    This value is used by the AI system to identify and dispatch appropriate movement
    behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Movement Generator Type
    code: "AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator* gen = new AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator();\n\
      int type = gen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\nif (type == MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_ASSISTANCE_DISTRAC)\n\
      {\n    // Handle assistance distract movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a pure virtual function implementation in the base MovementGenerator
    class. The return value typically corresponds to predefined constants in the TrinityCore
    codebase, such as MOVEMENTGENERATOR_TYPE_ASSISTANCE_DISTRAC or similar identifiers.
    The method should be called only on valid instances of AssistanceDistractMovementGenerator
    objects.
