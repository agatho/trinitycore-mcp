  method: SyncGroupQuests
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::SyncGroupQuests()
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes quest data across all members of a group in the World of Warcraft
    instance.
  description: The SyncGroupQuests method ensures that all players within a group
    have consistent and up-to-date quest information. This includes updating quest
    objectives, status flags, and any related quest-related data such as quest items
    or completion timestamps. The synchronization process typically occurs when a
    group member completes a quest step or when the group leader initiates a manual
    sync. It is essential for maintaining game state consistency in shared quest environments
    where multiple players collaborate on objectives. This method may also trigger
    updates to the group's quest log display and can affect quest progression for
    all members.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Sync
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = sGroupCoordinator->GetGroupCoordinator(player->GetGroup());\n\
      if (coordinator)\n{\n    coordinator->SyncGroupQuests();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically when quest progress changes
    within a group context. It may involve network communication to propagate updates
    to all group members, which could introduce slight delays in synchronization depending
    on player latency and server load.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid group context may result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Ensure that the player is actually part of a group before
    invoking this function to avoid potential crashes or data inconsistencies.
