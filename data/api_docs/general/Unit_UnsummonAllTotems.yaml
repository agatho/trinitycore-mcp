  class: Unit

  signature: void Unit::UnsummonAllTotems()
documentation:
  brief: Unsummons all summonedtotems from the unit.
  description: This method removes all active totems summoned by the unit, effectively
    clearing any totem-related effects. It is commonly used in player and NPC behavior
    to reset summoning state or during combat situations where totems need to be removed.
    The method operates on the principle that totems are stored in a list within the
    Unit class, and this function iterates through that list to remove each one.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->UnsummonAllTotems();'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during combat or when a unit's summoning state
    needs to be reset. It may also be used in conjunction with other methods like
    'SummonTOTEM' to manage the lifecycle of summoned totems.
  warnings: This method should only be called on units that have active totems; calling
    it on a unit without totems will result in no effect but may cause unnecessary
    overhead if used frequently.
