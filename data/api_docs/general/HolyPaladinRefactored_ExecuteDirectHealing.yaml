  class: HolyPaladinRefactored
  method: ExecuteDirectHealing
  signature: void HolyPaladinRefactored::ExecuteDirectHealing(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a direct healing spell on the specified target.
  description: The ExecuteDirectHealing method performs a healing action using a direct
    healing spell, targeting the provided unit. This method is typically used by holy
    paladins to restore health to allies within range. It may involve spell casting
    mechanics, resource consumption (such as mana or holy power), and healing calculations
    based on the paladin's stats and the target's current health status. The method
    assumes that all prerequisites for casting a healing spell are met, including
    valid target selection, sufficient resources, and proper positioning.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit's identifier or
      index in the game world. Must point to a valid target within the paladin's range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Execution
    code: 'int targetId = 42;

      this->ExecuteDirectHealing(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Healing with Precondition Check
    code: "if (player->IsAlive() && player->GetHealth() < player->GetMaxHealth())\
      \ {\n    int targetId = player->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    this->ExecuteDirectHealing(&targetId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core healing logic for holy paladins and should
    only be called when the paladin has sufficient mana or other required resources.
    It does not perform any validation on the target itself beyond ensuring it's a
    valid integer identifier.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid unit before calling this
    method, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also, make sure that the paladin is in a state where healing can be performed
    (not stunned, silenced, etc.).
