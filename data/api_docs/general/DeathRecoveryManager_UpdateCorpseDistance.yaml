documentation:
  brief: Updates the distance of a corpse relative to its owner in the DeathRecoveryManager
    system.
  description: The UpdateCorpseDistance method is responsible for recalculating and
    updating the spatial relationship between a player's corpse and their original
    location upon death. This method ensures that corpse positioning remains accurate
    within the game world, particularly when considering factors such as terrain,
    movement, or environmental changes. It typically operates as part of the death
    recovery mechanics in TrinityCore, maintaining consistency between the player's
    last known position and where their corpse is currently located. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs its operation based on internal state management
    within the DeathRecoveryManager class.

  - title: Basic Usage in Death Recovery Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerDeath(Player* player)\n{\n    // ... death logic ...\n\
      \    sDeathRecoveryMgr->UpdateCorpseDistance();\n    // Corpse distance is now\
      \ updated\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked automatically during player death processing
    or periodic corpse cleanup routines. It may involve calculations related to map
    boundaries, zone transitions, or server-side corpse decay timers. Developers should
    be aware that this method modifies internal state and could affect corpse visibility
    or respawn behavior.
