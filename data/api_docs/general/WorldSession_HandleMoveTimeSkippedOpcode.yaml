documentation:
  brief: Processes a client's time skip notification during movement, updating server-side
    time synchronization for the player.
  description: The HandleMoveTimeSkippedOpcode method is responsible for handling
    movement time skip messages sent by the client to the server. This typically occurs
    when the client experiences time distortion or skips forward in time during gameplay,
    such as when using certain spells, abilities, or game mechanics that affect time
    progression. The method updates internal server-side time tracking and synchronization
    for the player's movement state, ensuring that the server maintains an accurate
    representation of the player's temporal position within the game world. This helps
    maintain consistency between client and server states during time-related gameplay
    events.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleMoveTimeSkippedOpcode(WorldPackets::Movement::MoveTimeSkipped&\
      \ moveTimeSkipped)\n{\n    // Process time skip from client\n    _player->UpdateTimeSkip(moveTimeSkipped.Time);\n\
      \    // Synchronize with server time\n    _player->SetUpdateTime(GetGameTime());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the movement packet processing
    pipeline in TrinityCore. The server should validate that the time skip values
    are reasonable and within expected bounds to prevent exploitation. It's important
    to note that this method may be called multiple times during a single session,
    particularly when players experience frequent time-based effects.
  warnings: Improper handling of time skips can lead to desynchronization between
    client and server states, potentially causing movement glitches or incorrect spell
    timing. Developers should ensure that time skip values are validated against reasonable
    limits to prevent abuse or unexpected behavior in the game world.
