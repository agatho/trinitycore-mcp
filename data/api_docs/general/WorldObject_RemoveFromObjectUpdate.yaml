documentation:
  brief: Removes the object from the update manager's list of objects to be updated.
  description: The RemoveFromObjectUpdate method removes a WorldObject from the internal
    update system managed by TrinityCore. This ensures that the object will no longer
    be processed during world updates, which is typically done when an object is being
    destroyed or removed from the game world. The method is usually called internally
    by the core engine and should not generally be invoked directly by scripts or
    modules unless handling special cleanup scenarios. It's part of the object lifecycle
    management system that keeps the server's world state synchronized with client
    views.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during object destruction
    code: "void MyObject::OnDestroy()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup tasks\n    RemoveFromObjectUpdate();\n\
      \    // Other cleanup code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core engine during object
    destruction or removal from the world. Developers should not call this method
    manually unless implementing custom object lifecycle management logic. The method
    does not destroy the object itself, only removes it from update processing.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already removed object may lead to undefined
    behavior. It's crucial that this method is only invoked when the object is still
    valid and managed by the core engine.
