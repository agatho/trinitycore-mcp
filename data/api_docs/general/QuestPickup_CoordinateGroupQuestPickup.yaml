  class: QuestPickup
  method: CoordinateGroupQuestPickup
  signature: void QuestPickup::CoordinateGroupQuestPickup(Group * group, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates quest pickup for all members of a group.
  description: The CoordinateGroupQuestPickup method handles the distribution and
    processing of quest pickup events for all players within a specified group. This
    method ensures that each group member receives the appropriate quest-related updates,
    including quest acceptance, objective tracking, and reward eligibility. It is
    typically invoked when a group leader initiates a quest pickup or when a group
    member joins a quest that was already started by another group member. The method
    manages synchronization of quest states across multiple players and ensures consistent
    game state updates for all participants in the group.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players who will receive
      the quest pickup coordination. Must be a valid group instance with at least
      one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to be picked up by the group members.
      Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Quest Pickup
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestPickup::CoordinateGroupQuestPickup(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Group Quest Pickup
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->GetLeaderGuid()\
      \ == player->GetGUID())\n{\n    uint32 questId = 67890;\n    if (player->CanTakeQuest(questId,\
      \ false))\n    {\n        QuestPickup::CoordinateGroupQuestPickup(group, questId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group members are within the same zone and have
    appropriate quest access. It does not validate whether individual players can
    actually accept the quest - this should be handled beforehand. The method may
    trigger additional internal events such as quest update notifications and group
    synchronization messages.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null group pointer as it will likely cause
    a crash. Ensure that the questId is valid and exists in the database before calling
    to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should only be called when the group
    is fully formed and all members are present in the same world instance.
