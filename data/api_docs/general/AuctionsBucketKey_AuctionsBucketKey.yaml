    & key)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an AuctionsBucketKey object with data from a WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionBucketKey
    structure.
  description: This method serves as a constructor-like initializer for the AuctionsBucketKey
    class, populating its internal state using data provided by a WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionBucketKey
    packet. It is typically used when processing auction house bucket information
    received from the client or server. The method copies relevant fields such as
    item class, subclass, quality, and other identifying attributes that define an
    auction bucket key. This allows for consistent comparison and categorization of
    auctions within the auction house system.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A const reference to a WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionBucketKey
      structure containing the auction bucket data to be copied into this object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initializing AuctionsBucketKey from packet data
    code: 'WorldPackets::AuctionHouse::AuctionBucketKey packetKey;

      // Assume packetKey is populated with auction bucket data

      AuctionsBucketKey bucketKey;

      bucketKey.AuctionsBucketKey(packetKey); // Initialize bucketKey with packet
      data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct copy of the input structure's fields. It assumes
    that the input parameter is valid and properly initialized before calling. The
    AuctionsBucketKey class likely uses these fields for internal hashing or comparison
    operations within the auction house subsystem.
