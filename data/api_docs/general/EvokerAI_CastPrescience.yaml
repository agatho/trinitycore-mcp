  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastPrescience
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastPrescience(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Prescience spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastPrescience method is responsible for executing the Prescience
    spell cast by an Evoker AI-controlled creature. This spell typically provides
    vision or foresight abilities, allowing the evoker to see or predict future events
    or targets. The method takes a pointer to an integer representing the target unit
    and performs the necessary checks and spell casting logic. It is part of the Evoker's
    core AI behavior system and integrates with the TrinityCore spell system to ensure
    proper execution within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit for the Prescience
      spell. This value should point to a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player ID
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastPrescience
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = reinterpret_cast<EvokerAI*>(unit->GetAI());

      int targetId = 12345;

      cast<EvokerAI>(evoker)->CastPrescience(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Evoker AI has been properly initialized and
    that the target unit exists in the game world. The spell casting process includes
    validation of the target, checking for line-of-sight, and ensuring the evoker
    is not under any restrictions preventing spell casting.
  warnings: Ensure that the target ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing unit in the world. Passing an invalid or null pointer may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes.
