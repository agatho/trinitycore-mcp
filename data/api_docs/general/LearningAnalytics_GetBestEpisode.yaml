  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: GetBestEpisode
  signature: std::pair<uint32_t, float> LearningAnalytics::GetBestEpisode(uint32_t
    botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the best performing episode identifier and its corresponding reward
    value for a specified bot.
  description: The GetBestEpisode method retrieves the highest-scoring episode from
    the learning analytics data associated with a specific bot. It returns a pair
    containing the unique identifier (GUID) of the best episode and its associated
    reward value. This method is typically used in reinforcement learning scenarios
    within the TrinityCore framework to evaluate and analyze bot performance over
    time. The method assumes that episode data has been previously recorded and processed
    for the given bot GUID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::pair<uint32_t, float> where the first element is the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the best episode and the second element is the reward value associated
    with that episode. Returns a pair with default values if no data exists for the
    specified bot.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Best Episode for a Bot
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nuint32_t botGuid = 12345;\nstd::pair<uint32_t,\
      \ float> bestEpisode = analytics.GetBestEpisode(botGuid);\nif (bestEpisode.first\
      \ != 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Best Episode ID: \" << bestEpisode.first \n  \
      \            << \", Reward: \" << bestEpisode.second << std::endl;\n} else {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"No episode data found for bot.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a reinforcement learning system where bots
    learn from their experiences. The returned reward value may represent cumulative
    rewards, success rates, or other performance metrics depending on the implementation
    details. Ensure that episode data has been properly initialized and updated before
    calling this method.
  warnings: The method may return default values (0 for GUID and 0.0 for reward) if
    no valid episode data exists for the specified bot. This could lead to incorrect
    assumptions about bot performance if not handled properly in calling code.
