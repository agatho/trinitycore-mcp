  class: QuestManager
  method: AbandonQuest
  signature: bool QuestManager::AbandonQuest(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Abandons the specified quest for the player, removing it from their active
    quest log.
  description: The AbandonQuest method removes a quest from the player's active quest
    log. It verifies that the quest is currently active and can be abandoned by the
    player. If successful, the quest is removed from the player's quest log and any
    associated quest objectives are cleared. This method typically returns false if
    the quest cannot be found or is not in an abandonable state. The operation affects
    only the local player's quest data and does not modify server-side quest states
    directly.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to abandon. Must correspond to
      a valid active quest in the player's quest log.
  returns: True if the quest was successfully abandoned, false otherwise. Returns
    false if the quest is not found, not active, or cannot be abandoned due to game
    rules.
  examples:
  - title: Abandon a Quest by ID
    code: "if (player->GetQuestManager()->AbandonQuest(12345)) {\n    // Quest successfully\
      \ abandoned\n    player->SendNotification(\"Quest abandoned.\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Failed to abandon quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"Could not abandon\
      \ quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on the player's local QuestManager instance.
    The actual removal of quest data from the database is handled by the server logic.
    It is recommended to verify that the quest exists in the player's active quests
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid quest ID may result in undefined behavior
    or silent failures. Ensure that the quest ID corresponds to a valid, active quest
    before attempting to abandon it.
