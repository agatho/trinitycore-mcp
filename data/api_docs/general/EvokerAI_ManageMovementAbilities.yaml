documentation:
  brief: Manages movement abilities for the evoker AI, determining when and how to
    use movement-based spells or abilities.
  description: The ManageMovementAbilities method is responsible for controlling the
    evoker's movement behavior during combat. It evaluates the current situation,
    including target position, distance, and available movement abilities, to decide
    whether to use movement-based spells such as 'Sprint' or 'Leap'. This method ensures
    that the evoker AI makes intelligent decisions about when to reposition itself
    for optimal combat effectiveness. The method typically runs in the AI update cycle
    and integrates with other AI behaviors like spell casting and target selection.
    It may also consider environmental factors such as terrain or obstacles that could
    affect movement.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageMovementAbilities();\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless in specific custom AI implementations. The implementation
    likely uses internal state tracking to determine movement needs, such as distance
    to target or cooldown status of movement abilities.
