  method: GetCheckType
  signature: SpellTargetCheckTypes SpellImplicitTargetInfo::GetCheckType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target check type associated with this implicit spell target
    info.
  description: The GetCheckType method returns the SpellTargetCheckTypes enumeration
    value that defines how targets are validated for a specific spell implicit target.
    This check type determines what kind of validation logic should be applied when
    evaluating whether a potential target meets the requirements for the spell's implicit
    targeting mechanism. The returned value influences how the game engine processes
    target selection and validation during spell casting, particularly in cases where
    targets must satisfy certain conditions such as being hostile, friendly, or within
    specific proximity ranges.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellTargetCheckTypes enumeration value indicating the type of target
    checking logic to apply. Possible values include TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_NONE, TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_CASTER,
    TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_ENEMY, TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_ALLY, TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_FRIEND,
    TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_DEAD, TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_NEARBY, and others depending
    on the spell's targeting requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo;\nSpellTargetCheckTypes checkType =\
      \ targetInfo.GetCheckType();\nif (checkType == TARGET_CHECK_TYPE_UNIT_ENEMY)\n\
      {\n    // Handle enemy unit targeting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the spell system during target
    validation. The returned check type directly affects how target filtering and
    validation is performed, so it's important to understand that different check
    types may result in different target selection behaviors.
