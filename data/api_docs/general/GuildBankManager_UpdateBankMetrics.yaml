  signature: void GuildBankManager::UpdateBankMetrics(uint32 guildId, BankOperation
    operation, bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Updates guild bank metrics based on a bank operation and its success status.
  description: The UpdateBankMetrics method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    statistical metrics related to guild bank operations. It tracks various aspects
    of guild banking activities such as item deposits, withdrawals, and other transactions.
    This method ensures that the guild's banking data remains consistent and up-to-date
    with real-time transaction information. The method accepts a guild identifier,
    the type of operation performed, and whether the operation was successful to properly
    update internal metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild whose bank metrics are being updated.
      Must be a valid guild ID present in the database.
  - name: operation
    description: The type of bank operation that occurred. Should be one of the predefined
      BankOperation enum values indicating deposit, withdrawal, or other banking actions.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the bank operation completed successfully.
      True indicates success, false indicates failure or cancellation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update metrics for a successful deposit
    code: GuildBankManager::UpdateBankMetrics(12345, BankOperation::DEPOSIT, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Update metrics for a failed withdrawal
    code: GuildBankManager::UpdateBankMetrics(67890, BankOperation::WITHDRAWAL, false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the guild bank system when
    transactions occur. It may update internal counters or logging systems for analytics
    purposes. The method does not perform any database writes directly but rather
    updates in-memory metrics that may be flushed periodically to persistent storage.
  warnings: Ensure that the guildId provided corresponds to an existing guild, as
    invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or silent failures. The operation parameter
    must be a valid BankOperation enum value; otherwise, the method might not update
    metrics correctly.
