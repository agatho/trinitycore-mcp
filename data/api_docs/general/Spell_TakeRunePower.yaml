  brief: Takes rune power from the caster's resource pool
  description: This method handles the consumption of rune power resources when a
    spell is cast. It typically occurs during spell execution to reduce the caster's
    available rune power, which is essential for maintaining game balance and ensuring
    proper resource management. The method may be called multiple times per spell
    depending on the specific requirements of the spell being executed.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->TakeRunePower(true);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should only be called when the spell actually requires rune power
    to be consumed. This method is typically invoked during spell processing and may
    involve multiple calls depending on the number of runes required.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method can lead to resource depletion or incorrect
    spell execution. Care must be taken to ensure that rune power consumption aligns
    with the actual spell requirements.
