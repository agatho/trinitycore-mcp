  class: TankPositioning
  method: ScoreTankPosition
  signature: float TankPositioning::ScoreTankPosition(const int & pos, const CombatPositionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a scoring value for a given tank positioning within
    combat context.
  description: The ScoreTankPosition method calculates a numerical score representing
    the effectiveness or safety of a specified tank position based on the provided
    combat context. This scoring mechanism is typically used in AI-driven decision-making
    systems to determine optimal positioning strategies during encounters. The method
    considers various factors such as threat levels, distance to targets, and environmental
    constraints within the combat scenario. It serves as a core component for evaluating
    positioning decisions in dynamic battlefield conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific tank position to
      be evaluated. This value typically corresponds to predefined positions or coordinates
      within the game's positioning system.
  - name: context
    description: A CombatPositionContext object containing all relevant data about
      the current combat situation, including enemy positions, threat levels, terrain
      data, and other contextual factors that influence positioning decisions.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the calculated score for the given tank
    position. Higher scores indicate better or more favorable positioning, while lower
    scores suggest suboptimal placement. The exact scoring scale and interpretation
    depend on internal implementation logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float score = tankPositioning->ScoreTankPosition(5, combatContext);\nif\
      \ (score > 0.7f) {\n    // Position is considered optimal\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Evaluations
    code: "std::vector<float> scores;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalPositions; ++i) {\n\
      \    scores.push_back(tankPositioning->ScoreTankPosition(i, combatContext));\n\
      }\n\nauto bestPosition = std::max_element(scores.begin(), scores.end());\nint\
      \ optimalPos = std::distance(scores.begin(), bestPosition);\n// Use optimalPos\
      \ for tank positioning decision"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI positioning system and may be called
    frequently during combat scenarios. The scoring algorithm might incorporate dynamic
    weighting based on encounter type, player class, or gear level. Consider caching
    results when evaluating multiple positions to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided context object contains valid data;
    invalid or uninitialized context data may produce unpredictable results. Ensure
    that the position parameter is within expected bounds to prevent undefined behavior.
