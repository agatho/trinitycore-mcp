documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player's menu is empty
  description: The PlayerMenu::Empty() method determines if the player's menu contains
    any entries. This is typically used to verify whether a player has available options
    or actions in their interface menu, such as quest options, vendor items, or other
    interactive elements. The method returns true if no menu items are present, and
    false if there are items available for interaction. This check is commonly performed
    before displaying menu-related UI elements to avoid showing empty menus to players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player menu contains no entries, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic Menu Check
    code: "if (player->GetPlayerMenu()->Empty()) {\n    // No menu options available\n\
      \    player->SendNoMoney();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Menu Display
    code: "PlayerMenu* menu = player->GetPlayerMenu();\nif (!menu->Empty()) {\n  \
      \  // Show menu options\n    menu->SendMenu();\n} else {\n    // Handle empty\
      \ menu case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"No options available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other PlayerMenu methods
    like AddMenuItem() and SendMenu(). The implementation likely checks internal data
    structures that track menu item entries, so performance impact is minimal. This
    method should be called before attempting to display or interact with menu contents.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on a player who does not have an active
    menu session may return unexpected results. Always ensure proper context before
    checking menu state.
