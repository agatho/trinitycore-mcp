documentation:
  brief: Initializes druid equipment priorities for item management and gear selection.
  description: The InitializeDruidPriorities method sets up default equipment priority
    rules for druids within the game's equipment management system. This method configures
    how the game engine evaluates and selects appropriate gear items based on druid
    class-specific requirements, such as weapon types, armor categories, and enchantment
    preferences. The initialization process typically occurs during character creation
    or when loading a druid's saved equipment settings. It ensures that druids receive
    proper item recommendations and gear optimization according to their class abilities
    and gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Character Initialization
    code: "void Player::LoadCharacter()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    m_equipmentManager.InitializeDruidPriorities();\n    // Continue with other\
      \ loading procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the EquipmentManager during
    character setup. Developers should not need to invoke this method directly unless
    implementing custom druid equipment logic or debugging equipment-related systems.
    The initialization process may involve reading from configuration files or database
    entries that define druid-specific item preferences.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate priority entries or unexpected behavior in gear selection algorithms.
    Ensure that this method is only invoked once per druid character during the appropriate
    initialization phase to avoid conflicts with existing equipment settings.
