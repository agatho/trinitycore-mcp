  class: BotThreatManager
  method: GetPrimaryThreatTarget
  signature: ThreatTarget * BotThreatManager::GetPrimaryThreatTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the primary threat target of the bot's current threat manager.
  description: The GetPrimaryThreatTarget method returns a pointer to the ThreatTarget
    object that represents the highest-priority target in the bot's threat list. This
    target is typically the unit that has the most threat generated against it, and
    is used by the bot's AI to determine which enemy to focus on during combat. The
    returned ThreatTarget may be null if no valid threat targets exist or if the threat
    manager has not yet been initialized with any threats. This method is essential
    for implementing combat logic in bot AI systems where targeting decisions are
    based on threat levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the ThreatTarget object representing the primary threat target,
    or nullptr if no valid threat target exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check primary threat target
    code: "ThreatTarget* target = botThreatManager->GetPrimaryThreatTarget();\nif\
      \ (target != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process the primary threat target\n    Unit*\
      \ unit = target->GetUnit();\n    if (unit)\n    {\n        // Use the unit for\
      \ combat actions\n        bot->Attack(unit);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any locking or thread synchronization. If accessed
    from multiple threads, proper synchronization must be implemented by the caller.
    The returned ThreatTarget pointer is only valid while the threat manager and its
    associated units remain in scope.
  warnings: The returned ThreatTarget may become invalid if the underlying unit is
    destroyed or removed from combat. Always verify that the target unit is still
    valid before using it for actions. Avoid storing references to the returned ThreatTarget
    beyond the current execution context without proper lifetime management.
