  class: TradeManager
  method: SetSecurityLevel
  signature: void TradeManager::SetSecurityLevel(TradeSecurity level)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the security level for trade operations within the TradeManager.
  description: The SetSecurityLevel method configures the minimum security clearance
    required to perform trade-related actions within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method is typically used to enforce access controls on trading features based
    on player permissions or account privileges. The security level determines whether
    a player can initiate, accept, or modify trades according to predefined thresholds.
    This mechanism helps maintain game balance and prevents unauthorized trading activities
    in PvP and PvE environments.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The TradeSecurity enumeration value specifying the required security
      clearance level for trade operations. Valid values typically include NO_SECURITY,
      BASIC_SECURITY, MODERATE_SECURITY, and FULL_SECURITY, though exact values depend
      on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Basic Trade Security
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = sWorld->GetTradeManager();

      tradeMgr->SetSecurityLevel(BASIC_SECURITY);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Enforcing Full Security for Advanced Trades
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = sWorld->GetTradeManager();

      tradeMgr->SetSecurityLevel(FULL_SECURITY);

      // This prevents any trades unless players meet full security requirements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal state within the TradeManager class and
    may trigger validation checks on existing trade sessions. The implementation should
    be thread-safe as it's expected to be called from various game systems.
  warnings: Setting a high security level may prevent legitimate players from trading,
    especially in public markets or during events where normal gameplay is expected.
    Ensure that appropriate account permissions are configured before applying restrictive
    security levels.
