api:
  class: Item
  method: GetSlot
  signature: uint8 Item::GetSlot() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the slot position of the item within the player's inventory or bank.
  description: The GetSlot method retrieves the specific slot number where an item
    is located in the player's inventory or bank. This slot number corresponds to
    the item's position in the player's bag or backpack, and is used for various game
    mechanics including item management, equipment updates, and inventory operations.
    The method returns a uint8 value representing the slot index, which can range
    from 0 to 119 depending on whether the item is in a bag, backpack, or bank. This
    information is crucial for determining item placement and handling during item
    interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the slot position of the item within
    the player's inventory or bank. The value ranges from 0 to 119, where 0-119 represents
    different positions in the player's bag, backpack, or bank depending on the item
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);

      uint8 slot = item->GetSlot();

      // slot now contains the position of the item in the inventory'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods to determine item placement. It's important to note that the slot value
    returned by GetSlot corresponds to the item's actual position in the player's
    inventory, not necessarily its item ID or GUID.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return different values
    depending on whether the item is in a bag or backpack. The slot value can also
    vary based on the item type and location within the inventory.
