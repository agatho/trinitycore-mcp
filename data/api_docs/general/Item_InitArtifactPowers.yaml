  class: Item
  method: InitArtifactPowers
  signature: void Item::InitArtifactPowers(uint8 artifactId, uint8 artifactTier)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes artifact powers for the item based on the provided artifact ID
    and tier.
  description: The InitArtifactPowers method sets up the artifact powers associated
    with an item, configuring its abilities and enhancements according to the specified
    artifact ID and tier. This method is typically invoked during item creation or
    loading to ensure that artifact items have their correct power configurations.
    It initializes the internal state of the artifact, including its relic slots,
    artifact traits, and any associated bonuses. The method requires valid artifact
    data to be present in the game's database, otherwise it may not function correctly.
    This initialization is crucial for proper artifact functionality within the World
    of Warcraft game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: artifactId
    description: The unique identifier for the artifact type. This value determines
      which artifact template and associated powers are applied to the item.
  - name: artifactTier
    description: The tier level of the artifact, which affects the strength and number
      of powers available. Higher tiers typically provide more powerful abilities
      and additional relic slots.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Artifact Powers for a New Item
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->InitArtifactPowers(123, 5);

      // Initializes the item with artifact ID 123 at tier 5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Artifact Powers Based on Database Values
    code: 'uint8 artifactId = sObjectMgr->GetArtifactIdForItem(itemId);

      uint8 artifactTier = sObjectMgr->GetArtifactTierForItem(itemId);

      item->InitArtifactPowers(artifactId, artifactTier);

      // Initializes artifact powers using values retrieved from the database'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the item has been properly initialized
    and allocated. It modifies internal artifact state and should not be invoked multiple
    times on the same item without proper cleanup. The method relies on TrinityCore's
    artifact system and database entries to function correctly.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid artifactId or artifactTier values may
    result in undefined behavior or corrupted item data. Ensure that the provided
    parameters correspond to valid artifact definitions in the game database. This
    method modifies internal item state, so it should not be called on items that
    are already in use by players.
