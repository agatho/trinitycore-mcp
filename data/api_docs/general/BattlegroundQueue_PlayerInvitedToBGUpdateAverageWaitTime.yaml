  signature: void BattlegroundQueue::PlayerInvitedToBGUpdateAverageWaitTime(GroupQueueInfo
    * ginfo, int bracket_id)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the average wait time for a group queue when a player is invited
    to a battleground.
  description: This method updates the average wait time calculation for a specific
    battleground queue group when a player is invited to join a battleground. It is
    typically called as part of the battleground queue system's logic to maintain
    accurate statistics about how long players typically wait before being matched
    into a battleground. The method takes a pointer to the group queue information
    and the bracket ID to determine which queue statistics to update. This helps in
    balancing queue times and improving matchmaking efficiency across different battleground
    brackets.
  parameters:
  - name: ginfo
    description: Pointer to the GroupQueueInfo structure containing queue information
      for the group being processed
  - name: bracket_id
    description: Integer identifier representing the battleground bracket (e.g., 0
      for 15v15, 1 for 10v10, etc.)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating average wait time after player invitation
    code: "GroupQueueInfo* groupInfo = bgQueue->GetGroupQueueInfo(queueSlot);\nif\
      \ (groupInfo)\n{\n    bgQueue->PlayerInvitedToBGUpdateAverageWaitTime(groupInfo,\
      \ bracketId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal battleground queue management system
    and should only be called during appropriate queue processing phases. The update
    operation modifies internal statistics used for matchmaking balancing.
