  class: ArtifactPower
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ArtifactPower::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Item * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes artifact power creation data to a byte buffer for client synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the artifact power's state into a
    ByteBuffer, which is then sent to the client to synchronize the artifact power's
    creation. This method is typically invoked when an artifact power is initially
    created or when it needs to be communicated to a specific player. It handles encoding
    of relevant artifact power properties such as power ID, rank, and associated item
    data. The method requires both an owner item and a receiver player to properly
    format the data for transmission.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized artifact power creation
      data will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Item object that owns this artifact power. Used to
      extract item-specific properties and identifiers.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the artifact power
      data. Used for player-specific serialization logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Artifact Power Initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Item* ownerItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);

      ArtifactPower artifactPower;

      artifactPower.WriteCreate(data, ownerItem, player);

      player->SendDirectMessage(&data);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Artifact Power Data to Multiple Players
    code: "ByteBuffer data;\nItem* ownerItem = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\n\
      for (auto& targetPlayer : playerList) {\n    artifactPower.WriteCreate(data,\
      \ ownerItem, targetPlayer);\n    targetPlayer->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Item and Player objects are valid and
    not null. It is typically used internally by TrinityCore's packet handling system
    when sending artifact power creation updates to players.
  warnings: Ensure that the ByteBuffer is properly initialized before calling this
    method, and that the owner item and receiver player are valid to avoid undefined
    behavior or crashes.
