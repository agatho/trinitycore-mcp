  class: TradeManager
  method: AcceptTradeRequest
  signature: bool TradeManager::AcceptTradeRequest(int requesterGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Accepts a trade request from another player and initiates the trade process.
  description: The AcceptTradeRequest method is used by the TradeManager class to
    accept an incoming trade request from another player. This method validates that
    a valid trade request exists for the specified requester GUID, ensures both players
    are in a valid state to engage in trading (e.g., not in combat, within range),
    and begins the trade session. It handles the necessary game state transitions
    and updates internal trade data structures to reflect the acceptance of the trade.
    The method returns true if the trade was successfully accepted and false otherwise,
    which may occur due to invalid request states, player conditions, or other game
    logic constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: requesterGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who initiated the trade
      request. This value must correspond to a valid online player in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the trade request was successfully accepted and the trade
    session began; returns false if the trade could not be accepted due to invalid
    state, player conditions, or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Acceptance
    code: "if (tradeManager->AcceptTradeRequest(playerGuid)) {\n    // Trade successfully\
      \ initiated\n    SendTradeStatus(TRADE_STATUS_ACCEPTED);\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to accept trade\n    SendTradeStatus(TRADE_STATUS_CANCELLED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Trade Acceptance with Validation
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(requesterGuid);\nif (!player\
      \ || !player->IsInWorld()) {\n    return false;\n}\n\nif (tradeManager->AcceptTradeRequest(requesterGuid))\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with trade UI updates and state synchronization\n    UpdateTradeUI();\n\
      \    return true;\n}\nreturn false;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a valid trade request has already been initiated
    by the requester. It does not perform the initial trade request creation, which
    is typically handled by another method such as SendTradeRequest. The method may
    be called from different threads depending on how the TrinityCore server handles
    player interactions, so thread safety should be considered if used in asynchronous
    contexts.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that a valid trade request exists
    for the requester GUID can lead to undefined behavior or failed trades. Additionally,
    calling this during combat or when players are not within trading range will likely
    result in failure and may trigger client-side error messages.
