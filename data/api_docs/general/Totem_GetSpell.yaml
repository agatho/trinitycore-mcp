  class: Totem
  method: GetSpell
  signature: int Totem::GetSpell(int slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell ID associated with a specified totem slot.
  description: The GetSpell method retrieves the spell ID that corresponds to a given
    totem slot for the current totem object. This method is typically used in the
    context of totem management within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework,
    where each totem can have multiple slots (e.g., for different types of totems
    like Fire, Water, Earth, Air). The spell ID returned represents the specific ability
    or effect that the totem provides when active. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is purely a getter function.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the spell ID associated with the specified
    totem slot. If no valid spell is assigned to the slot, it may return 0 or a default
    value indicating an invalid or empty slot.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spell ID from Totem Slot
    code: "Totem* totem = player->GetTotem(TOTEM_SLOT_FIRE);\nint spellId = totem->GetSpell(0);\n\
      if (spellId != 0)\n{\n    // Process the spell ID\n    sLog->outString(\"Fire\
      \ Totem Spell ID: %d\", spellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the totem object is valid and initialized. It's
    recommended to check if the totem exists before calling this method to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the totem slot index passed to this method is within valid
    bounds (typically 0-3 for standard totems). Accessing invalid slots may result
    in unexpected behavior or data corruption.
