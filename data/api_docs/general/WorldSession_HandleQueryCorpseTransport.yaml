  signature: void WorldSession::HandleQueryCorpseTransport(WorldPackets::Query::QueryCorpseTransport
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Handles incoming corpse transport query packets from clients to retrieve
    information about corpse transportation mechanics.
  description: The HandleQueryCorpseTransport method processes incoming WorldPackets::Query::QueryCorpseTransport
    packets sent by players. This method is responsible for handling client requests
    related to corpse transportation, which typically occurs when a player's corpse
    is being moved between locations or when the client needs information about how
    corpses are transported in the game world. The method likely retrieves and sends
    back relevant data about corpse transport mechanics such as transport IDs, positions,
    or timing information. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper corpse
    handling during combat scenarios and player death sequences in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueryCorpseTransport(WorldPackets::Query::QueryCorpseTransport&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process the query for corpse transport information\n  \
      \  // Send back relevant transport data to the client\n    // Implementation\
      \ details depend on server-side corpse transport logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and operates
    within the context of player session management. It likely interacts with the
    game's corpse transportation subsystem to provide accurate information about how
    corpses are moved through the world. The method should be thread-safe as it operates
    on per-session data structures.
  warnings: This method is critical for proper corpse transport functionality, and
    incorrect handling may result in players not being able to properly retrieve their
    corpses after death. Ensure that all transport-related data is validated before
    sending to clients.
