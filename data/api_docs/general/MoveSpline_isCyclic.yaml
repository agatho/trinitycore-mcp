  method: isCyclic
  signature: bool MoveSpline::isCyclic() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the movement spline is configured for cyclic (repeating)
    motion.
  description: The isCyclic() method checks if the MoveSpline object has been configured
    to repeat its path infinitely. This is commonly used in WoW for creating looping
    animations or continuous movement patterns, such as rotating platforms or moving
    elevators. When a spline is cyclic, it will automatically restart from the beginning
    once it reaches the end of its defined path. The method returns true if the spline
    is set to loop, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for implementing
    certain game mechanics that require seamless, continuous motion without abrupt
    stops or resets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the movement spline is configured for cyclic (repeating)
    motion; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spline is cyclic before applying movement
    code: "MoveSpline* spline = player->movespline;\nif (spline->isCyclic()) {\n \
      \   // Handle cyclic movement logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Spline is cyclic,\
      \ will loop infinitely\");\n} else {\n    // Handle normal movement\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Spline is not cyclic\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using isCyclic() to control animation behavior
    code: "void ApplyMovementBehavior(Unit* unit) {\n    MoveSpline* spline = unit->movespline;\n\
      \    if (spline->isCyclic()) {\n        // Set continuous animation state\n\
      \        unit->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_INTERACTION);\n \
      \   } else {\n        // Reset to normal behavior\n        unit->RemoveFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS,\
      \ UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_INTERACTION);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spline configuration methods
    that set the cyclic flag. The implementation relies on internal flags within the
    MoveSpline class that are set during spline initialization or modification. It's
    important to note that checking this flag does not guarantee the spline will actually
    loop, as other conditions such as path validity or movement constraints may also
    affect behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using cyclic splines in performance-critical code paths,
    as they may require additional processing to maintain continuous motion. Also,
    ensure proper cleanup of cyclic splines to prevent memory leaks or unintended
    infinite loops in movement logic.
