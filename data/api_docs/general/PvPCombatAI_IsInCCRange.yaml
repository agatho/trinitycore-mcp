documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is within the range of a specific crowd control
    effect.
  description: The IsInCCRange method checks if a given player is within the effective
    range of a specified crowd control (CC) ability. This method is typically used
    in PvP combat AI logic to evaluate whether a target can be affected by a particular
    CC spell or ability. It considers the player's current position and the target's
    position, along with the specific type of CC being evaluated. The method returns
    true if the player is within range for the specified CC effect, false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP scenarios where positioning
    and spell targeting are key factors.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or position
      data. This parameter typically refers to the player unit object or its unique
      identifier within the game world.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      data. This parameter usually refers to the enemy unit object or its unique identifier
      in the game world.
  - name: ccType
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of crowd control effect being
      evaluated. Common values may include CC_STUN, CC_ROOT, CC_SILENCE, etc., depending
      on the implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the effective range of the specified
    crowd control ability; otherwise returns false. The method evaluates positional
    relationships and CC-specific range parameters to make this determination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in PvP AI logic
    code: "if (pvpAI->IsInCCRange(&playerGuid, &targetGuid, CC_STUN)) {\n    // Player\
      \ is within stun range\n    DoStunSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking multiple CC types
    code: "bool canRoot = pvpAI->IsInCCRange(&playerGuid, &targetGuid, CC_ROOT);\n\
      bool canSilence = pvpAI->IsInCCRange(&playerGuid, &targetGuid, CC_SILENCE);\n\
      if (canRoot || canSilence) {\n    // Choose appropriate CC based on range\n\
      \    if (canRoot) DoRootSpell();\n    else DoSilenceSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal game positioning and distance calculations.
    It may use cached position data for performance reasons, so calling it repeatedly
    in tight loops could be inefficient. The exact range values for different CC types
    are determined by the game's spell definitions and may vary between different
    abilities.
  warnings: Ensure that player and target pointers are valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. The CCType parameter must match a supported crowd
    control type, otherwise the result is unpredictable. This method should not be
    called during critical sections of AI processing where performance is crucial
    due to potential distance calculations.
