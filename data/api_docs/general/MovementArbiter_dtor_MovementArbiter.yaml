documentation:
  brief: Destroys the MovementArbiter instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MovementArbiter class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures, canceling pending movement operations,
    and ensuring that no dangling references remain. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this class likely manages character movement logic,
    pathfinding, and client-server synchronization related to unit positioning. The
    destructor ensures proper cleanup when a MovementArbiter object is removed from
    memory, preventing resource leaks and maintaining system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of MovementArbiter
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    MovementArbiter arbiter;\n    // ... movement\
      \ logic ...\n    // arbiter is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's typically invoked automatically when the object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In TrinityCore, movement arbiters are often managed
    by higher-level systems such as AI controllers or unit managers.
