  signature: int ObstacleUtils::FindLineCircleIntersections(const int & lineStart,
    const int & lineEnd, const int & center, float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the intersection points between a line segment and a circle.
  description: The FindLineCircleIntersections method determines how many times a
    line segment defined by two points intersects with a circle centered at a given
    point with a specified radius. It returns the number of intersection points found,
    which can be zero, one, or two. This utility is commonly used in pathfinding,
    collision detection, and game mechanics to determine if obstacles block visibility
    or movement paths. The method assumes that all input coordinates are in the same
    spatial reference frame and that the line segment and circle are defined in 2D
    space.
  parameters:
  - name: lineStart
    description: The starting point of the line segment, represented as an integer
      identifier or coordinate value. This parameter defines one endpoint of the line
      segment used for intersection testing.
  - name: lineEnd
    description: The ending point of the line segment, represented as an integer identifier
      or coordinate value. This parameter defines the other endpoint of the line segment
      used for intersection testing.
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the circle, represented as an integer identifier
      or coordinate value. This defines the location around which the circle is centered
      for intersection calculations.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circle used for intersection testing. Must be a
      positive floating-point number representing the distance from the center to
      the edge of the circle.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of intersection points found between
    the line segment and the circle. A return value of 0 means no intersections, 1
    means one tangent point, and 2 means two intersection points. The method may also
    return negative values to indicate error conditions such as invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Pathfinding
    code: "int intersections = ObstacleUtils::FindLineCircleIntersections(100, 200,\
      \ 150, 5.0f);\nif (intersections > 0) {\n    // Handle obstacle blocking path\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Collision Detection with Multiple Obstacles
    code: "float radius = 3.0f;\nint start = GetPlayerPosition();\nint end = GetTargetPosition();\n\
      int center = GetObstaclePosition();\nint count = ObstacleUtils::FindLineCircleIntersections(start,\
      \ end, center, radius);\nif (count == 2) {\n    // Line intersects circle at\
      \ two points - obstacle blocks path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs geometric calculations using standard mathematical formulas
    for line-circle intersection. It is optimized for performance in real-time game
    environments and should be used carefully when dealing with large numbers of simultaneous
    checks. The integer-based parameters are typically assumed to represent spatial
    coordinates or object identifiers that can be converted to floating-point values
    for calculation purposes.
  warnings: Ensure all input parameters are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    coordinates or negative radii may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
    When using integer representations of coordinates, consider potential precision
    loss during conversion to floating-point calculations. This method does not account
    for 3D spatial relationships; it operates on 2D projections.
