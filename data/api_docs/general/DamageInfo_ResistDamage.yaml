  class: DamageInfo
  method: ResistDamage
  signature: void DamageInfo::ResistDamage(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Reduces the damage amount by the resistance value for the current damage
    info instance.
  description: The ResistDamage method modifies the internal damage amount stored
    within a DamageInfo object by subtracting the specified resistance value. This
    method is typically used during combat calculations to apply magical or physical
    resistances that reduce incoming damage. The operation directly affects the final
    damage dealt to a target, making it an essential part of the game's damage calculation
    system in TrinityCore. It should be called after all initial damage has been calculated
    but before the final damage is applied to the target.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of damage to reduce from the current damage value. This
      represents the resistance value that will be subtracted from the total damage.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Damage Resistance Application
    code: 'DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();

      damageInfo->SetDamage(100);

      damageInfo->ResistDamage(25);

      // The final damage will be reduced to 75'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Multiple Resistances
    code: 'DamageInfo* damageInfo = new DamageInfo();

      damageInfo->SetDamage(150);

      damageInfo->ResistDamage(30); // First resistance

      // ... additional logic ...

      damageInfo->ResistDamage(15); // Second resistance

      // Final damage is 105'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the DamageInfo object directly.
    It does not return a new object but instead alters the current instance's damage
    value. Developers should ensure that resistance values are properly validated
    before calling this method to avoid negative damage values or other unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a resistance amount greater than the current
    damage may result in negative damage values, which could lead to unintended healing
    effects or other game mechanics issues. Always validate input parameters and consider
    using appropriate bounds checking.
