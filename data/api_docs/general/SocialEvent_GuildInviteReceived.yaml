  class: SocialEvent
  method: GuildInviteReceived
  signature: SocialEvent SocialEvent::GuildInviteReceived(int player, int target,
    std::string inviterName, uint64 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a SocialEvent object representing a guild invitation
    received by a player.
  description: The GuildInviteReceived method constructs a SocialEvent instance that
    represents a player receiving an invitation to join a guild. This event is typically
    triggered when a player is invited to a guild by another player, and it encapsulates
    the relevant data including the inviting player's name, the target player's ID,
    and the guild identifier. The returned SocialEvent can be used to process or dispatch
    the invitation within the game's social system. This method is part of TrinityCore's
    social event handling framework and supports the core guild invitation mechanics
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who received the guild
      invitation.
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player being invited to
      the guild.
  - name: inviterName
    description: The name of the player who sent the guild invitation, as a string.
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the guild that is sending the invitation.
  returns: A SocialEvent object representing the guild invitation received event.
    This object can be used to process or dispatch the invitation within the game's
    social system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GuildInviteReceived
    code: SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::GuildInviteReceived(12345, 67890, "InviterName",
      54321);
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing a guild invitation received event
    code: "SocialEvent event = SocialEvent::GuildInviteReceived(playerGuid, targetGuid,\
      \ inviterName, guildGuid);\n// Process the event to handle the guild invite\n\
      if (event.IsValid()) {\n    // Dispatch or handle the invitation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's social event system and should be used
    in conjunction with other SocialEvent handlers. The returned SocialEvent object
    may require additional processing to fully implement the guild invitation flow,
    including UI updates and database persistence.
  warnings: Ensure that player and guild GUIDs are valid before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected behavior. The inviterName parameter should be sanitized to
    prevent injection attacks if used in UI rendering or logging.
