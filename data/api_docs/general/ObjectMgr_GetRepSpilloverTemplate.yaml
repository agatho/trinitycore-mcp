documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation spillover template associated with a specified faction
    ID.
  description: The GetRepSpilloverTemplate method fetches the RepSpilloverTemplate
    data structure that defines how reputation gains from a specific faction spill
    over to other factions. This is used in World of Warcraft's reputation system
    to determine which factions receive bonus reputation when a player earns reputation
    with the specified faction. The method performs a lookup in the internal faction
    spillover template database and returns a pointer to the matching template, or
    nullptr if no such template exists for the given faction ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a RepSpilloverTemplate structure that contains the spillover
    configuration for the specified faction. Returns nullptr if no spillover template
    is defined for the given faction ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use reputation spillover template
    code: "const RepSpilloverTemplate* spillover = sObjectMgr->GetRepSpilloverTemplate(729);\n\
      if (spillover)\n{\n    // Use the spillover template to determine which factions\
      \ receive bonus rep\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < MAX_SPILLOVER_FACTIONS; ++i)\n\
      \    {\n        if (spillover->faction[i] > 0)\n        {\n            // Process\
      \ faction spillover logic\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during reputation gain processing to determine
    which factions should receive bonus reputation when a player earns reputation
    with a specific faction. The internal lookup uses an optimized data structure
    for fast retrieval, but the returned pointer is only valid while the ObjectMgr
    instance remains active.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if no spillover template exists for the
    specified faction ID. Always check for null before using the returned value to
    avoid dereferencing a nullptr. This method should not be called during faction
    template loading phases as the data might not yet be initialized.
