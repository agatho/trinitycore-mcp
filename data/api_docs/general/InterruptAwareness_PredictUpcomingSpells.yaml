  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: PredictUpcomingSpells
  signature: int InterruptAwareness::PredictUpcomingSpells(int casterGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Predicts and returns the number of upcoming spells that will be interrupted
    by the specified caster.
  description: The PredictUpcomingSpells method analyzes the current state of spell
    casting and interruption mechanics within the TrinityCore framework to determine
    how many spells are likely to be interrupted by a given caster. This method is
    typically used in AI or combat logic systems to anticipate spell interactions
    and manage interruptible spell queues. It evaluates the caster's GUID against
    active spell effects and returns a count of predicted interruptions. The method
    does not modify any internal state but provides a predictive value based on current
    game context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of upcoming spells that are predicted
    to be interrupted by the caster identified by the provided GUID. Returns zero
    if no interruptions are predicted or if the caster is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int interruptCount = interruptAwareness->PredictUpcomingSpells(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate spell tracking and interruption logic within
    TrinityCore's core systems. It assumes that all relevant spell data is properly
    synchronized and available in the current game state. The prediction may vary
    depending on spell casting times, interruptible flags, and other combat mechanics.
  warnings: The method signature indicates a const function but may internally access
    mutable game state. Ensure thread safety when calling this method from concurrent
    contexts. Incorrect caster GUIDs may lead to unexpected results or zero returns.
