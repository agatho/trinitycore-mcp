  class: ArenaAI
  method: OnMatchStart
  signature: void ArenaAI::OnMatchStart(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes AI behavior when an arena match begins
  description: The OnMatchStart method is invoked when an arena match commences, allowing
    the ArenaAI instance to perform initial setup and state changes. This method typically
    handles preparation of the AI-controlled player for combat, including resetting
    any relevant flags, initializing combat-related variables, and preparing the unit's
    behavior for the match duration. It ensures that the AI is properly configured
    before the match begins and that all necessary systems are initialized for arena-specific
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier or index
      within the arena match. This parameter likely identifies which specific player
      in the arena this AI instance is controlling.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena match initialization
    code: "void MyArenaAI::OnMatchStart(int* player)\n{\n    // Reset combat flags\n\
      \    m_isInCombat = false;\n    \n    // Initialize AI state\n    m_aiState\
      \ = AI_STATE_PREPARE;\n    \n    // Set up initial target\n    if (player &&\
      \ *player >= 0)\n        m_targetGuid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(*player);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the arena match start sequence and
    should not be used for long-running operations due to potential performance impact
    on match initialization. The player parameter may be null or invalid if called
    outside of a proper arena context.
  warnings: Ensure that all internal state variables are properly reset before calling
    this method, as improper initialization can lead to undefined behavior during
    combat. Avoid performing expensive operations in this method to prevent delays
    in match start.
