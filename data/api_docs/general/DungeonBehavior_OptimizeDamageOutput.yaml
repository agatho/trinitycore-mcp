  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: OptimizeDamageOutput
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::OptimizeDamageOutput(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes damage output for a group during a dungeon encounter by adjusting
    player behavior and targeting strategies.
  description: The OptimizeDamageOutput method is responsible for dynamically adjusting
    how players within a group engage with dungeon encounters to maximize overall
    damage dealt. This method analyzes the current group composition, individual player
    roles, and encounter mechanics to determine optimal targeting priorities and damage
    distribution strategies. It ensures that the group's damage output is efficiently
    utilized against the encounter's health pool while considering factors such as
    cooldowns, damage-over-time effects, and positional requirements. The method operates
    within the context of TrinityCore's dungeon encounter system and integrates with
    the group's AI behavior to enhance combat effectiveness.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group participating
      in the dungeon encounter. This parameter must not be null and should contain
      valid group members with appropriate roles assigned.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      dungeon encounter properties, including health pool, mechanics, and phase transitions.
      This parameter provides context for how damage optimization should be applied
      during the specific encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dungeon encounter
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    dungeonBehavior.OptimizeDamageOutput(group, encounter);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with custom targeting logic
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::ProcessEncounterPhase(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    // Pre-optimize damage before critical phase\n    dungeonBehavior.OptimizeDamageOutput(group,\
      \ encounter);\n    \n    // Apply additional targeting adjustments based on\
      \ encounter state\n    if (encounter.GetPhase() == PHASE_CRITICAL)\n    {\n\
      \        // Custom logic for critical phase\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during dungeon encounter initialization and
    phase transitions. It relies on accurate group member data and encounter state
    information to function correctly. The optimization algorithm considers player
    class abilities, cooldown management, and encounter-specific mechanics to determine
    the most effective damage distribution strategy.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer and DungeonEncounter reference are valid
    before calling this method, as invalid parameters may cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method modifies group AI behavior dynamically, so calling it
    repeatedly during a single encounter phase may result in conflicting optimizations.
