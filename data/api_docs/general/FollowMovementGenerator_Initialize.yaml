  class: FollowMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void FollowMovementGenerator::Initialize(Unit * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the follow movement generator with the specified unit target.
  description: The Initialize method sets up a FollowMovementGenerator to begin following
    a specified target unit. This method is typically called when a creature or player
    starts following another unit, such as when a pet begins to follow its owner or
    when an NPC starts following a quest giver. The movement generator will handle
    pathfinding and movement updates to maintain the follow distance and position
    relative to the target unit. It prepares internal state variables required for
    continuous tracking of the target's movements.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that this movement generator will follow.
      This parameter must not be null and should point to a valid Unit instance in
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize Follow Movement Generator for a Pet
    code: 'Unit* owner = player->GetPet();

      FollowMovementGenerator* followGen = new FollowMovementGenerator(owner);

      followGen->Initialize(owner);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize Follow Movement Generator with Error Checking
    code: "if (targetUnit && targetUnit->IsInWorld()) {\n    FollowMovementGenerator*\
      \ followGen = new FollowMovementGenerator(targetUnit);\n    followGen->Initialize(targetUnit);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid unit case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a movement generator. It sets up internal tracking data structures and should
    not be invoked repeatedly without proper cleanup. The target unit must remain
    valid throughout the lifetime of this movement generator to prevent memory access
    violations.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the target unit will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target unit is valid and in the game world
    before calling Initialize. Reinitializing an already initialized movement generator
    may lead to resource leaks or inconsistent state.
