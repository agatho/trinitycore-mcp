documentation:
  brief: Reorganizes and compacts memory allocations within the bot memory manager
    to reduce fragmentation and improve performance.
  description: The PerformMemoryDefragmentation method is responsible for reorganizing
    memory blocks managed by the BotMemoryManager to minimize fragmentation. This
    process helps optimize memory usage by consolidating free memory blocks and reducing
    the number of scattered memory segments. In the context of TrinityCore's AI bot
    system, this method ensures that bots can efficiently allocate and deallocate
    memory during their operation without suffering from performance degradation due
    to memory fragmentation. The method typically operates internally and may be triggered
    automatically or manually depending on the system's memory management strategy.

  examples:
  - title: Manual Memory Defragmentation Trigger
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = sObjectMgr->GetBotMemoryManager();

      memoryManager->PerformMemoryDefragmentation();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during low-activity periods or when memory
    pressure is detected. It may cause temporary performance overhead during execution
    as it reorganizes memory blocks. The operation is generally safe to call from
    any thread, but the underlying memory manager's thread-safety should be considered.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can introduce unnecessary overhead.
    It should only be invoked when memory fragmentation becomes significant or when
    explicitly required by system maintenance routines.
