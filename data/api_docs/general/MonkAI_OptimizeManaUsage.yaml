  signature: void MonkAI::OptimizeManaUsage()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes mana usage for the Monk AI by determining the most efficient spell
    casting sequence based on available mana and combat conditions.
  description: The OptimizeManaUsage method in the MonkAI class calculates and applies
    the most effective mana management strategy for a monk character during combat.
    This includes evaluating current mana levels, assessing the urgency of healing
    or damage spells, and selecting optimal abilities that maximize performance while
    conserving resources. The method considers factors such as target health percentages,
    available mana, cooldowns, and the monk's current class-specific abilities. It
    is typically invoked during AI decision-making processes to ensure efficient resource
    allocation without compromising combat effectiveness. This method does not require
    any input parameters and modifies internal AI state variables related to spell
    selection and mana conservation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n\
      \        monkAI->OptimizeManaUsage();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI decision-making framework and should be
    called regularly during combat updates. It assumes that the AI has access to valid
    target information and current mana values. The optimization algorithm may vary
    based on the specific monk specialization (Mistweaver, Windwalker, Brewmaster)
    though this implementation likely applies general principles across all specs.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper AI initialization or when the monk
    is not in combat may lead to incorrect spell selection. Ensure that mana and target
    state are properly updated before invoking this function.
