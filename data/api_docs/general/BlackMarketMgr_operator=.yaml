documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a BlackMarketMgr object to another BlackMarketMgr instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on a BlackMarketMgr
    object, transferring all resources and state from the source object to the target
    object. This is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate BlackMarketMgr
    objects need to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary copying. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method would be relevant
    when managing black market auctions and their associated data structures. The
    operation leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state, typically
    as an empty or default-initialized instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the BlackMarketMgr object that received the move assignment,
    allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'BlackMarketMgr manager1;

      BlackMarketMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses operator=

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // manager2 contains all the data that was in manager1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'BlackMarketMgr mgr1, mgr2, mgr3;

      // ... populate managers with data ...

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr2); // Move mgr2 to mgr1

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr3); // Move mgr3 to mgr1 (overwriting previous content)

      // Both mgr2 and mgr3 are now in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation. It's important
    to note that after a move assignment, the source object should not be used unless
    it's explicitly reset or reassigned. The performance benefit comes from avoiding
    deep copying of internal data structures, instead transferring pointers or handles
    directly.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move assignment can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always ensure that any references or pointers to the source object are
    invalidated or reinitialized. This is particularly important in multithreaded
    environments where concurrent access to moved objects could cause issues.
