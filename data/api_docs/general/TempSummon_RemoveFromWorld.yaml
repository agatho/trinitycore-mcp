  method: RemoveFromWorld
  signature: void TempSummon::RemoveFromWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the temporary summon from the game world, cleaning up its presence
    and associated resources.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method is responsible for removing a TempSummon
    instance from the active game world. This includes unregistering the summon from
    the world's object manager, removing it from any maps it may be on, and ensuring
    that all references to the summon are properly cleared. The method typically gets
    called when the temporary summon's duration expires or when it is explicitly dismissed
    by its owner. It ensures proper cleanup of the summon's presence in the game state
    and prevents memory leaks or dangling references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TempSummon* summon = player->GetSummon();\nif (summon)\n{\n    summon->RemoveFromWorld();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Summon on Expiration
    code: "void TemporarySummon::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_timer <= diff)\n\
      \    {\n        RemoveFromWorld();\n        return;\n    }\n    m_timer -= diff;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should not be called directly from outside the class hierarchy
    unless necessary. It typically gets invoked internally by the summon's owner or
    the world manager when cleanup is required. The method performs essential cleanup
    operations and should not be bypassed to prevent memory leaks.
  warnings: Calling RemoveFromWorld on an already removed summon may lead to undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the summon exists before calling this method. Additionally,
    ensure that no other systems are actively referencing the summon when this method
    is invoked.
