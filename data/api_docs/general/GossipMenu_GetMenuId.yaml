  signature: uint32 GossipMenu::GetMenuId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the gossip menu.
  description: The GetMenuId method returns the unique identifier associated with
    a specific gossip menu instance. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    gossip menus are used to present interactive dialogue options to players, typically
    through NPCs. This identifier is crucial for tracking and managing different menu
    states during player interactions. The method is read-only and does not modify
    any internal state of the GossipMenu object. It serves as a key for identifying
    which specific menu a player is currently viewing or interacting with.
  parameters: []
  returns: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the gossip
    menu. This ID is typically assigned by the server when the menu is created and
    remains constant throughout the menu's lifetime.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GossipMenu* menu = player->GetSession()->GetPlayer()->GetGossipMenu();

      uint32 menuId = menu->GetMenuId();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("player.gossip", "Current gossip menu ID: %u", menuId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Menu Identification in Dialogue Handling
    code: "void HandleGossipSelect(Player* player, uint32 menuId, uint32 sender, uint32\
      \ action)\n{\n    switch (menuId)\n    {\n        case 1001:\n            //\
      \ Handle menu 1001\n            break;\n        case 1002:\n            // Handle\
      \ menu 1002\n            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other gossip-related functions
    to maintain state during player interactions. The returned ID should be treated
    as immutable and cannot be changed after the menu object is initialized.
