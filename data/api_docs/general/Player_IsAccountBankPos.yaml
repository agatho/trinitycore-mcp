documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given bag and slot combination represents an account
    bank position.
  description: The IsAccountBankPos method checks if a specified bag and slot combination
    corresponds to an account bank location within the player's inventory. This method
    is used to verify account bank-related positions during item operations, particularly
    when handling items that can be stored in account bank slots. It returns true
    if the position is valid for account bank storage, false otherwise. The method
    is commonly used in conjunction with other inventory management functions to ensure
    proper handling of account bank items.
  parameters:
  - name: bag
    description: The bag identifier to check, typically ranging from 0 to 119. Valid
      values include all bag types except the player's main backpack.
  - name: slot
    description: The slot within the specified bag to check, ranging from 0 to 119.
      Valid values include all valid slots for account bank storage.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bag and slot combination represents an account
    bank position; otherwise returns false.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsAccountBankPos(0, 0))\n{\n    // Handle account bank item\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle regular inventory item\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the player's inventory management system and should
    be used in conjunction with other account bank related methods. It is typically
    used during item handling operations to ensure proper positioning of items in
    account bank slots.
  warnings: This method should not be used for checking regular inventory positions,
    as it only applies to account bank slots. Using incorrect bag/slot combinations
    may lead to invalid results or errors.
