api:
  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: CalculateZoneScore
  signature: float FarmingCoordinator::CalculateZoneScore(int * player, const FarmingZoneInfo
    & zone) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a scoring value for a specified farming zone based
    on player data.
  description: The CalculateZoneScore method computes a numerical score representing
    the suitability or efficiency of a given farming zone for a specific player. This
    score is typically used to determine optimal farming locations, prioritize zones
    for player activities, or evaluate zone performance in relation to player capabilities.
    The calculation likely considers factors such as player level, zone difficulty,
    resource availability, and other relevant game mechanics. The method takes a pointer
    to player data and a reference to the farming zone information to perform its
    evaluation.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing player data, likely containing
      player statistics such as level, skills, or other relevant attributes used in
      scoring calculations.
  - name: zone
    description: Constant reference to a FarmingZoneInfo structure that contains detailed
      information about the farming zone, including its properties, difficulty, resource
      types, and other relevant data for scoring.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated score for the specified farming
    zone. Higher scores typically indicate better suitability or higher efficiency
    for the player, while lower scores suggest less favorable conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerData[10] = {10, 5, 3, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6, 9, 1};

      FarmingZoneInfo zone;

      // Assume zone is populated with data

      float score = coordinator.CalculateZoneScore(playerData, zone);

      // Use the score to determine optimal farming location'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify internal state
    of the FarmingCoordinator object. It's recommended that player data be valid and
    properly initialized before calling this method to ensure accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null and points to a valid array
    with sufficient elements. Incorrect or uninitialized zone data may lead to unpredictable
    scoring results.
