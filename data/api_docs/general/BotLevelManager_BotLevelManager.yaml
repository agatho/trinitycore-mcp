documentation:
  brief: Copies the state and configuration of another BotLevelManager instance
  description: The BotLevelManager copy constructor initializes a new BotLevelManager
    object by copying all member variables and configuration data from an existing
    BotLevelManager instance. This constructor is typically used when creating duplicate
    bot level management configurations or when transferring settings between different
    bot instances. The copied instance maintains identical state to the source, ensuring
    consistent behavior across bot level calculations and adjustments. This method
    is essential for maintaining uniformity in bot difficulty scaling and progression
    systems within TrinityCore's bot framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source BotLevelManager instance whose state and configuration
      will be copied to this new instance
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying BotLevelManager Configuration
    code: 'BotLevelManager originalManager;

      // Configure originalManager...

      BotLevelManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage

      // newManager now has identical configuration to originalManager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This copy constructor performs a shallow copy of all member variables. If
    the BotLevelManager contains pointers or dynamic memory allocations, developers
    should ensure proper deep copying behavior is implemented elsewhere in the class.
    The constructor should be called only when a complete duplication of the manager's
    state is required.
