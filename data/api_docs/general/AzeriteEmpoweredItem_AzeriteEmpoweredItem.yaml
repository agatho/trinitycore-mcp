  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AzeriteEmpoweredItem class with default
    values.
  description: The AzeriteEmpoweredItem constructor initializes a new instance of
    the AzeriteEmpoweredItem class. This method sets up the internal state of the
    object, including initializing member variables and preparing the item for use
    within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor is typically invoked when creating
    a new azerite empowered item in the game world, such as when a player receives
    a new azerite weapon or armor piece that has been infused with azerite powers.
    It ensures all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized
    to support azerite empowerment mechanics including trait ranks, level, and visual
    effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Azerite Empowered Item
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem* newItem = new AzeriteEmpoweredItem();

      // The item is now initialized and ready for use in the game world

      // with default azerite empowerment settings.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically called when creating an instance of AzeriteEmpoweredItem.
    It's important to note that while this constructor initializes the object, additional
    setup may be required for the item to function properly within the game world,
    such as setting the item's GUID, owner, or applying specific azerite traits.
