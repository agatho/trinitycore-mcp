  class: EconomyManager
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void EconomyManager::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the economy system within the TrinityCore server.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the economy system is active
    on the server. When enabled, players can engage in transactions, purchase items,
    and interact with in-game currency systems. When disabled, economy-related features
    are typically suspended or restricted. This method is commonly used during server
    maintenance, testing, or when implementing custom economy rules. The change takes
    effect immediately without requiring a server restart.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean value indicating the desired state of the economy system.
      True enables the economy, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Economy System
    code: EconomyManager::GetSingleton().SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Economy System During Maintenance
    code: EconomyManager::GetSingleton().SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies a global state variable that affects all players and
    services relying on the economy system. It's recommended to use this method in
    conjunction with proper logging or server status notifications to inform players
    of economy changes.
  warnings: Disabling the economy system may break quests, vendors, or other systems
    that depend on currency transactions. Ensure all dependent systems are properly
    handled before calling this method.
