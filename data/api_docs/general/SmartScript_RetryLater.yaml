  class: SmartScript
  method: RetryLater
  signature: void SmartScript::RetryLater(SmartScriptHolder & e, bool ignoreChanceRoll)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a smart script event to be retried at a later time, optionally
    ignoring chance roll conditions.
  description: The RetryLater method is used within the SmartScript system to defer
    execution of a script event to a future time. This allows for delayed actions
    or retries in case of temporary failures. The method accepts a reference to a
    SmartScriptHolder which contains the event data and can optionally ignore any
    chance roll conditions that might prevent the event from executing immediately.
    This is particularly useful for implementing cooldowns, retry mechanisms, or timed
    events in AI behavior scripts.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object containing the script event
      data to be retried later.
  - name: ignoreChanceRoll
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to bypass chance roll conditions.
      If true, the event will be scheduled for retry regardless of any chance-based
      restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Retry Usage
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      event.event_type = SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_OOC;

      smartScript.RetryLater(event, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Retry with Chance Roll Bypass
    code: 'SmartScriptHolder event;

      // ... populate event with data ...

      event.event_type = SMART_EVENT_RECEIVE_EMOTE;

      event.chance = 50; // 50% chance to trigger

      smartScript.RetryLater(event, true); // Retry regardless of chance roll'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the SmartScript system when an
    event cannot be executed immediately due to conditions like cooldowns or chance
    rolls. It's important to note that calling RetryLater does not guarantee immediate
    execution of the event, but rather schedules it for a future time when conditions
    may be met.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to infinite retry loops if not properly
    managed with appropriate delays or exit conditions. Developers should ensure that
    retry mechanisms have proper termination criteria to prevent performance issues.
