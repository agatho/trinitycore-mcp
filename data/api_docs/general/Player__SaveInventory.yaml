documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's inventory to the database, including all items and their
    quantities.
  description: The _SaveInventory method is responsible for persisting the player's
    inventory state to the database. This includes saving all items in the player's
    possession, their quantities, and any associated enchantments or properties. The
    method ensures that the player's inventory remains consistent across server restarts
    and sessions. It typically handles the serialization of item data and writes it
    to the appropriate database tables.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for database operations. This parameter
      determines which transaction to use when saving inventory data to the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inventory Save Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveInventory(0);

      // Saves inventory with transaction ID 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called during player logout or when the player's
    session ends. It may involve database transactions and should be used carefully
    to avoid data inconsistencies.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to inventory loss or corruption if
    not handled correctly. The transaction parameter must be properly managed to ensure
    database integrity.
