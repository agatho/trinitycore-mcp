  class: MistweaverSoothingMistTracker
  method: GetTarget
  signature: int MistweaverSoothingMistTracker::GetTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the target identifier of the Mistweaver Soothing Mist ability
  description: The GetTarget method retrieves the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the current target that the Mistweaver's Soothing Mist ability is applied to.
    This method is typically used within the context of a Mistweaver monk's healing
    rotation to determine which unit is currently benefiting from the soothing mist
    effect. The returned value represents the target's unique identifier within the
    game world, allowing for tracking and management of the spell's application and
    duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the target unit currently affected
    by Soothing Mist, or 0 if no valid target exists
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Target
    code: "int targetGuid = tracker->GetTarget();\nif (targetGuid != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Soothing Mist is currently applied to a valid target\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_owner,\
      \ targetGuid);\n    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n    {\n        // Perform\
      \ healing logic for the target\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Target in Healing Logic
    code: "void MistweaverSoothingMistTracker::Update()\n{\n    int targetGuid = GetTarget();\n\
      \    if (targetGuid != 0)\n    {\n        Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*m_owner,\
      \ targetGuid);\n        if (target && target->IsAlive())\n        {\n      \
      \      // Apply healing or update aura duration\n            m_owner->DealHealing(target,\
      \ GetHealAmount(), true);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            //\
      \ Target is dead or invalid, reset tracker\n            Reset();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the tracker has been properly initialized and that
    a valid target exists. The returned GUID should be used with ObjectAccessor::GetUnit()
    to retrieve the actual Unit object for further operations. This method is typically
    called during spell update or tick events.
  warnings: The method returns 0 when no valid target exists, which should be checked
    before attempting to use the returned value. Using an invalid GUID with ObjectAccessor::GetUnit()
    may result in a null pointer dereference if not properly validated.
