  class: QuestPickup
  method: GetGlobalPickupMetrics
  signature: QuestPickupMetrics QuestPickup::GetGlobalPickupMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global quest pickup metrics for tracking quest engagement and player
    behavior across the entire server.
  description: The GetGlobalPickupMetrics method returns a QuestPickupMetrics object
    containing aggregated statistics about quest pickups across all players in the
    game world. This includes data such as total pickups, pickup rates per quest,
    and distribution of pickup times. The metrics are useful for analyzing player
    engagement patterns, identifying popular quests, and understanding how players
    interact with quest systems. The returned data is typically used for server-side
    analytics, game balance tuning, and feature development decisions. This method
    does not require any parameters and provides a snapshot of global quest pickup
    behavior at the time of invocation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestPickupMetrics object containing aggregated statistics about quest
    pickups across all players in the server. The structure includes fields such as
    total pickup counts, average pickup times, and distribution data for analysis
    purposes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Global Metrics
    code: 'QuestPickupMetrics metrics = sQuestPickup->GetGlobalPickupMetrics();

      TC_LOG_INFO("quest", "Total Quest Pickups: %u", metrics.totalPickups);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Metrics for Server Analytics
    code: 'QuestPickupMetrics globalMetrics = sQuestPickup->GetGlobalPickupMetrics();

      float avgPickupTime = globalMetrics.averagePickupTime;

      uint32 totalPickups = globalMetrics.totalPickups;

      TC_LOG_INFO("quest", "Average pickup time: %.2f seconds, Total pickups: %u",
      avgPickupTime, totalPickups);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method aggregates data from all active players and quests in the server.
    The metrics are calculated using internal tracking mechanisms that may not reflect
    real-time changes immediately. For performance reasons, frequent calls to this
    method should be avoided in high-frequency code paths.
  warnings: The returned QuestPickupMetrics object is a copy of the internal data
    structure. Modifications to the returned object will not affect the actual global
    metrics. Ensure proper logging or analytics handling when processing large volumes
    of metric data.
