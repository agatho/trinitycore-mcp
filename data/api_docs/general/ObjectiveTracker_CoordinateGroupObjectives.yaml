  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: CoordinateGroupObjectives
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::CoordinateGroupObjectives(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates group objectives for a specified quest among all group members.
  description: The CoordinateGroupObjectives method synchronizes quest-related objectives
    within a group by ensuring that all group members are aware of the current quest
    state and progress. This method is typically invoked when a group member completes
    a quest objective or when a new quest is assigned to the group. It updates the
    objective tracker for each group member, ensuring consistency across the group's
    quest progress. The method handles the distribution of quest data to all players
    in the specified group, making sure that their local objective trackers reflect
    the same information. This functionality is essential for maintaining synchronized
    quest progress in group scenarios within World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members whose objectives
      need to be coordinated. Must not be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which group objectives should
      be coordinated. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for coordinating group quest objectives
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker*\
      \ tracker = player->GetObjectivelyTracker();\n    if (tracker)\n    {\n    \
      \    tracker->CoordinateGroupObjectives(playerGroup, 12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is valid and that all members are within
    the same zone or instance. It may trigger network updates to synchronize objective
    states across clients. The method does not validate if the quest is actually part
    of the group's active objectives, so it should be used carefully in contexts where
    quest state consistency is critical.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Additionally, if the questId does not exist or is not properly registered
    in the game's quest system, the method may fail silently or cause inconsistencies
    in the objective tracking system.
