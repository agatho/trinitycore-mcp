  class: Player
  method: IsAtGroupRewardDistance
  signature: bool Player::IsAtGroupRewardDistance(const int * pRewardSource) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is within the group reward distance for quest
    rewards.
  description: This method checks if the player is at a distance that allows them
    to receive group quest rewards. It evaluates whether the player's position relative
    to the group members meets the requirements for receiving rewards, such as being
    within the specified distance range for group quest completion. The method is
    typically used in quest reward processing logic and helps determine if players
    can participate in group quest rewards.
  parameters:
  - name: pRewardSource
    description: Pointer to the reward source that determines the distance check.
      This parameter defines the specific reward source being evaluated for distance.
  returns: Returns true if the player is within group reward distance, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the player is outside the required distance range
    for group quest rewards.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsAtGroupRewardDistance(nullptr))\n{\n    // Player can receive\
      \ group quest rewards\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other quest reward methods
    and may be called during quest completion processing. Implementation relies on
    the player's current position relative to group members and distance calculations.
  warnings: This method should not be used for general distance checks, as it specifically
    relates to group quest reward mechanics. Using it incorrectly can lead to improper
    quest reward handling.
