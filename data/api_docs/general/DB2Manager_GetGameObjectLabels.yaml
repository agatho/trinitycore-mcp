  signature: int DB2Manager::GetGameObjectLabels(uint32 gameobjectId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the label identifier associated with a specific game object from
    the DB2 database.
  description: The GetGameObjectLabels method fetches the label identifier (typically
    used for identifying interactive or categorized game objects) for a given game
    object ID. This functionality is essential for retrieving metadata about game
    objects, such as their type, category, or interaction flags, which are stored
    in the DB2 files. The method operates on the DB2Manager's internal data structures
    and assumes that the requested game object exists within the loaded DB2 data.
    It does not perform any validation of the input ID, so calling it with an invalid
    game object ID may result in undefined behavior or incorrect return values.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the label identifier associated with the
    specified game object. If the game object is not found or the data is invalid,
    the method may return a default value or an unexpected result depending on internal
    implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Label for a Game Object
    code: "int labelId = sDB2Manager->GetGameObjectLabels(12345);\nif (labelId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process the label ID\n    printf(\"Game object label: %d\\n\", labelId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-loaded DB2 data structures. Ensure that the DB2
    files are properly initialized before calling this method. The returned label
    ID may be used to look up additional metadata in other systems or databases.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid game object ID can lead to undefined
    behavior. Always validate input IDs or ensure they come from trusted sources such
    as loaded DB2 records.
