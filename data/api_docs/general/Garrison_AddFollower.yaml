  class: Garrison
  method: AddFollower
  signature: void Garrison::AddFollower(uint32 garrFollowerId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a follower to the garrison using the specified follower ID.
  description: The AddFollower method is used to add a follower to the player's garrison.
    This method takes a unique identifier for the follower (garrFollowerId) and integrates
    the follower into the garrison's roster. The follower will be available for missions
    and other garrison activities once added. This method likely updates internal
    garrison data structures and may trigger UI updates or notifications to the player.
    It is typically invoked when a player acquires a new follower through quest completion,
    vendor purchases, or other game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: garrFollowerId
    description: The unique identifier for the garrison follower to be added. This
      ID corresponds to entries in the garrison follower database and determines which
      specific follower is being added to the player's garrison.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Add a Follower to Garrison
    code: 'Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();

      garrison->AddFollower(12345); // Adds follower with ID 12345 to the garrison'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the garrison system and likely interacts with internal
    data structures that track follower availability, mission assignments, and resource
    consumption. It may also update the player's garrison UI and trigger related events
    or callbacks.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided garrFollowerId corresponds to a valid follower
    in the game database; invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or errors. This
    method should only be called when the player has an active garrison.
