  class: ChaseMovementGenerator
  method: ChaseMovementGenerator
  signature: void ChaseMovementGenerator::ChaseMovementGenerator(Unit * target, int
    range, int angle)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a chase movement generator to move towards a target unit within
    a specified range and angle.
  description: The ChaseMovementGenerator constructor initializes a movement generator
    that will cause a unit to chase a target unit. It sets up the parameters for how
    the unit should approach the target, including the desired distance (range) and
    angular orientation (angle). This is typically used in AI behavior for enemy units
    to follow players or other targets in a controlled manner. The generator calculates
    the appropriate path and movement speed to maintain the specified chase parameters
    during execution.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that this movement generator will chase.
      Must be a valid unit pointer, typically a player or NPC.
  - name: range
    description: The desired distance in yards from the target unit to maintain while
      chasing. A value of 0 usually means to get as close as possible.
  - name: angle
    description: The angular offset in degrees from the target's facing direction
      to determine where to position the chaser. Values typically range from -180
      to 180 degrees.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Movement Initialization
    code: 'ChaseMovementGenerator generator(targetUnit, 5, 0);

      // This will make the unit chase targetUnit at a distance of 5 yards, directly
      in front'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chase with Angular Offset
    code: 'ChaseMovementGenerator generator(enemyUnit, 3, 45);

      // This will make the unit chase enemyUnit at a distance of 3 yards, positioned
      at 45 degrees to the right'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when setting
    up movement behaviors. The range and angle parameters are used to calculate positioning
    during movement updates. The generator will automatically adjust its path if the
    target moves or if obstacles are encountered.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this constructor,
    as passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior. The range parameter
    should be carefully chosen to avoid unrealistic movement patterns or collision
    issues with other units.
