documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotSpawnerAdapter instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSpawnerAdapter class is responsible for releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the adapter. This method
    ensures proper cleanup when the adapter object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this may involve cleaning
    up internal data structures related to bot spawning logic, such as cached configurations,
    active bot references, or temporary storage used during the spawning process.
    The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object is
    destroyed and should not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSpawnerAdapter
    code: "void exampleFunction() {\n    BotSpawnerAdapter adapter;\n    // ... use\
      \ adapter ...\n    // Destructor is automatically called here when adapter goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be implemented to ensure no memory leaks occur in the
    bot spawning system. It's important that all internal pointers are properly deallocated
    and any registered callbacks or listeners are unregistered to prevent dangling
    references.
