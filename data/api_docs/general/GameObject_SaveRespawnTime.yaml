  signature: void GameObject::SaveRespawnTime(uint32 forceDelay)
documentation:
  brief: Saves the respawn time for a game object, updating its database entry with
    the current respawn delay.
  description: The SaveRespawnTime method updates the database record for a GameObject
    to store its current respawn time. This is typically called when a game object
    (such as a chest, door, or quest objective) has been interacted with and needs
    to be marked for future respawning. The method uses the provided forceDelay parameter
    to determine how long until the object respawns, overriding any default delay
    values. This ensures that the object's respawn state is persisted across server
    restarts and sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: forceDelay
    description: The respawn delay in seconds to be saved for this game object. If
      zero, the default respawn time from the database or template will be used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Saving a custom respawn delay
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...; // Assume we have a valid GameObject pointer

      uint32 customDelay = 300; // 5 minutes

      go->SaveRespawnTime(customDelay);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using default respawn delay
    code: 'GameObject* go = ...;

      go->SaveRespawnTime(0); // Uses the object''s default respawn time from DB'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database to persist the respawn state.
    It should be called after modifying a GameObject's respawn behavior, such as when
    a player interacts with it or when its state changes. The method does not trigger
    any immediate respawning; it only saves the delay for future use.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper GameObject state management may lead
    to inconsistent respawn times. Ensure that the GameObject is in a valid state
    before calling this function, especially if it's being manipulated during gameplay.
