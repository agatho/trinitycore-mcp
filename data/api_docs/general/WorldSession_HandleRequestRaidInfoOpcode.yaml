  class: WorldSession

  signature: void WorldSession::HandleRequestRaidInfoOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::RequestRaidInfo
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Handles client requests for raid information, including instance data and
    group details.
  description: The HandleRequestRaidInfoOpcode method processes incoming requests
    from players for detailed raid information. This typically occurs when a player
    opens the raid browser or attempts to join a raid instance. The method retrieves
    relevant instance data, group composition details, and other pertinent raid-related
    information from the server's internal structures. It then constructs and sends
    a response packet back to the requesting client containing this information. This
    functionality is essential for maintaining proper raid coordination and ensuring
    players have access to accurate instance and group data.

  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRequestRaidInfoOpcode(WorldPackets::Party::RequestRaidInfo&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Process raid info request\n    SendRaidInfo();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the party/raid management system in TrinityCore. It
    should only be called from within the network packet handling flow. The method
    assumes that the session has proper authentication and that the player is in a
    valid state to request raid information.
  warnings: Improper handling of this opcode can lead to incorrect raid data being
    displayed to players, potentially causing confusion during group activities. Ensure
    that all instance data is properly validated before sending to clients.
