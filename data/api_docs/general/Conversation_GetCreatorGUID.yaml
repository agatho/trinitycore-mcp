api:
  class: Conversation
  method: GetCreatorGUID
  signature: int Conversation::GetCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who created the conversation.
  description: The GetCreatorGUID method returns the globally unique identifier of
    the player who initiated or created the conversation. This GUID is used internally
    by TrinityCore to track and manage conversation ownership, ensuring that only
    the creator or authorized players can interact with or modify the conversation.
    The method does not perform any validation on the returned GUID and assumes the
    conversation object is properly initialized. In World of Warcraft context, this
    is particularly relevant for quest-related conversations and dialogue systems
    where player interaction and ownership are important for game progression.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the creator player. This value corresponds
    to the player's unique identifier within the TrinityCore database system, typically
    used in database queries and object references.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectAccessor->GetConversationById(12345);\nif (conv)\n\
      {\n    int creatorGUID = conv->GetCreatorGUID();\n    // Use creatorGUID for\
      \ further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Conversation Ownership
    code: "Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(creatorGUID));\n\
      if (player && player->GetGUID().GetCounter() == creatorGUID)\n{\n    // Confirm\
      \ that the creator is still online and matches expected GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the conversation object has been properly initialized
    with a valid creator. If called on an uninitialized or invalid conversation, the
    behavior may be undefined. The returned integer value represents the low part
    of the full GUID and should not be used directly for database operations without
    proper conversion to ObjectGuid.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned GUID corresponds to an active player object.
    The creator might have logged out or been deleted from the server. Always validate
    the GUID against existing players before performing operations that require active
    player interaction.
