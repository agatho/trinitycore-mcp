  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetScalingStatContentTuning() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the content tuning ID associated with the item's scaling statistics.
  description: The GetScalingStatContentTuning method returns the content tuning identifier
    that governs how an item's scaling statistics are adjusted based on player level
    and other game mechanics. This value is typically used in conjunction with scaling
    stat data to dynamically modify item properties such as damage, armor, or stats
    as players progress through different content tiers. The returned ID corresponds
    to entries in the ContentTuning.db2 database file which defines the rules for
    how items scale within specific content contexts. This method does not perform
    any validation on the returned value and assumes that the item template has been
    properly initialized with valid scaling stat data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the content tuning ID associated with the item's
    scaling statistics. This ID references entries in the ContentTuning.db2 database
    file which define scaling rules for different content tiers and difficulty levels.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ contentTuningId = itemTemplate->GetScalingStatContentTuning();\nif (contentTuningId\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use contentTuningId to fetch scaling rules from ContentTuning.db2\n\
      \    printf(\"Item uses content tuning ID: %u\\n\", contentTuningId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Scaling Stat Application Example
    code: "void ApplyItemScaling(ItemTemplate* itemTemplate, Player* player)\n{\n\
      \    uint32 contentTuningId = itemTemplate->GetScalingStatContentTuning();\n\
      \    if (contentTuningId > 0)\n    {\n        // Fetch scaling stat data based\
      \ on content tuning ID\n        ContentTuningEntry const* tuningEntry = sContentTuningStore.LookupEntry(contentTuningId);\n\
      \        if (tuningEntry)\n        {\n            // Apply scaling rules to\
      \ item stats\n            uint32 playerLevel = player->GetLevel();\n       \
      \     // ... scaling logic here ...\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of item scaling systems within
    World of Warcraft. The returned content tuning ID should be validated against
    the ContentTuning.db2 database to ensure proper scaling behavior. Performance-wise,
    this is a simple getter method with O(1) complexity and no significant overhead.
  warnings: The method returns 0 when no scaling stat content tuning is defined for
    an item, which may indicate either a missing or improperly configured item template.
    Developers should always validate the returned value before using it in scaling
    calculations to avoid incorrect stat application.
