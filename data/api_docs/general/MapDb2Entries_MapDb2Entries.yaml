  class: MapDb2Entries
  method: MapDb2Entries
  signature: void MapDb2Entries::MapDb2Entries(const MapEntry * map, const MapDifficultyEntry
    * mapDifficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the MapDb2Entries object with the provided map and difficulty
    entry data.
  description: The MapDb2Entries constructor initializes internal data structures
    using the provided MapEntry and MapDifficultyEntry objects. This method sets up
    the necessary mappings between game map identifiers and their corresponding difficulty
    settings, which are essential for determining player access levels, loot distribution,
    and quest availability in different map difficulties. The initialization process
    ensures that all relevant database entries are properly loaded and accessible
    for runtime operations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to a MapEntry object containing the base map information
      including map ID, name, and basic properties. Must not be null.
  - name: mapDifficulty
    description: Pointer to a MapDifficultyEntry object containing difficulty-specific
      settings for the map such as player limit, reset time, and difficulty flags.
      Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'MapEntry* mapEntry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(1); // Instance of MapEntry
      for map ID 1

      MapDifficultyEntry* difficultyEntry = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(1);

      MapDb2Entries entries(mapEntry, difficultyEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup or when loading
    map data from the database. It's important to ensure that both parameters are
    valid and properly initialized before calling this method to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Passing null pointers to either parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate input parameters before initialization.
