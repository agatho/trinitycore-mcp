  brief: Returns the game rules configuration identifier for the world
  description: Retrieves the current game rules configuration value that defines the
    active rule set for the world instance. This integer identifier is used internally
    by TrinityCore to determine which set of game rules and mechanics are currently
    active, such as PvP rules, loot systems, or expansion-specific behaviors. The
    returned reference provides direct access to the stored game rules value without
    creating a copy, ensuring efficient access patterns. This method is typically
    called during world initialization, rule validation, or when checking the active
    configuration state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current game rules
    configuration identifier. The specific numeric values correspond to predefined
    rule sets within the TrinityCore codebase, with common values including 0 for
    default rules, 1 for PvP rules, and higher numbers for expansion-specific configurations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int gameRules = world.GetGameRules();\nif (gameRules == 1) {\n    // Handle\
      \ PvP rule set\n    printf(\"PvP rules are active\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Rule Set Validation
    code: "const int& rules = world.GetGameRules();\nswitch (rules) {\n    case 0:\n\
      \        printf(\"Default game rules active\\n\");\n        break;\n    case\
      \ 1:\n        printf(\"PvP game rules active\\n\");\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        printf(\"Custom rule set ID: %d\\n\", rules);\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable, so modifications
    to the game rules should be done through dedicated setter methods rather than
    direct assignment. This method is thread-safe as long as no concurrent modification
    occurs during access.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference directly as it may cause undefined
    behavior. Always use appropriate setter methods for changing game rules configuration
    values. The integer value returned may vary between different TrinityCore builds
    or configurations.
