  signature: void WorldSession::SendAuctionOwnerBidNotification(const AuctionPosting
    * auction)
documentation:
  brief: Sends an auction owner bid notification to the player who owns the auction
    item.
  description: The SendAuctionOwnerBidNotification method is responsible for informing
    the auction owner when a bid has been placed on their auctioned item. This method
    is typically called internally by the auction house system when a successful bid
    occurs. It prepares and sends a specific packet to the owner's client, notifying
    them of the new bid amount and bidder name. The notification includes details
    about the auction, such as the item being bid on, the bid amount, and the bidder's
    identity. This mechanism ensures that auction owners are promptly informed of
    bidding activity on their items.
  parameters:
  - name: auction
    description: Pointer to the AuctionPosting object representing the auction for
      which a bid has been placed. Must not be null.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in auction processing
    code: "void AuctionHouseMgr::ProcessBid(AuctionPosting* auction, Player* bidder,\
      \ uint32 bidAmount)\n{\n    // ... bid validation logic ...\n    if (auction->GetOwner()\
      \ && auction->GetOwner()->GetSession())\n    {\n        auction->GetOwner()->GetSession()->SendAuctionOwnerBidNotification(auction);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the auction house system's internal notification mechanism.
    It should only be called when a bid has actually been placed and accepted. The
    method assumes that the auction object contains valid data about the bid and owner.
    Performance-wise, this method sends a network packet to the player's client, so
    it should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: The method requires that the auction parameter is valid and not null.
    Passing a null pointer will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. Additionally,
    ensure that the auction owner actually has an active session before calling this
    method to avoid sending packets to disconnected players.
