documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player meets the race requirements for accepting a quest
  description: The MeetsRaceRequirement method evaluates whether the current player
    character satisfies the racial prerequisites defined for a specific quest. This
    function is typically invoked during quest acceptance validation to ensure that
    players can only accept quests that are appropriate for their character's race.
    The method accesses internal quest data and compares it against the player's race,
    returning true if the requirements are met or false otherwise. It plays a critical
    role in maintaining game balance and ensuring proper quest progression based on
    player character attributes.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the quest ID. This parameter is
      expected to point to a valid quest identifier within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns true if the player's race meets the requirements specified in the
    quest data, false otherwise. A return value of false typically prevents the quest
    from being accepted by the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest acceptance
    code: "if (questManager.MeetsRaceRequirement(&questId)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ quest acceptance logic\n    player->AddQuest(questId);\n} else {\n    // Send\
      \ error message to player\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not meet the\
      \ race requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and assumes that the
    provided quest ID is valid. The implementation likely uses cached or pre-fetched
    quest information to improve performance during frequent checks.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest pointer passed to this method points to a valid
    quest ID; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method should only be
    called when the player is actively attempting to accept a quest.
