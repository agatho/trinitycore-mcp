documentation:
  brief: Returns the player object of the group's designated healer.
  description: The GetGroupHealer method retrieves the Player object that represents
    the current group's designated healer. This is typically used in combat specialization
    systems where specific roles are assigned to players within a group, such as for
    raid encounters or battlegrounds. The method checks the group's current healer
    assignment and returns a pointer to the Player object if one exists, or nullptr
    if no healer has been designated. This functionality is crucial for systems that
    need to identify which player should be prioritized for healing actions or when
    determining role-based behavior in combat scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object representing the group's healer, or nullptr
    if no healer is assigned to the group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for group healer
    code: "Player* healer = combatSpec->GetGroupHealer();\nif (healer != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Perform actions specific to targeting the group healer\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      Targeting group healer: \" + healer->GetName());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ case where no healer is designated\n    SendChatMessage(\"No group healer\
      \ assigned.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the group's current healer assignment, which may be
    updated dynamically during gameplay. The returned Player pointer should be validated
    for null before use to prevent dereferencing a nullptr. Performance is generally
    low as it involves group state lookups and validation.
  warnings: Using the returned Player pointer without checking for null can cause
    crashes. This method does not guarantee that the returned player is currently
    in the same map or instance as the calling object, so additional validation may
    be required for cross-instance operations.
