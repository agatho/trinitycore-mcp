documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ProcEventInfo object with actor, target, and spell-related
    data for processing proc events in the TrinityCore engine.
  description: The ProcEventInfo constructor initializes internal state variables
    used to track and process spell procs within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts
    pointers to actor, action target, and proc target entities, along with various
    masks defining the type, phase, and hit conditions of the proc event. This method
    is typically invoked during spell effect application or combat damage calculation
    when a proc condition is met. The constructor sets up the necessary context for
    subsequent proc handling logic, including spell type classification, phase information,
    and hit result details. It's part of the core combat system's event-driven architecture
    that manages triggered abilities and passive effects.
  parameters:
  - name: actor
    description: Pointer to the entity that initiated the proc event (e.g., caster
      or attacker). Can be null if not applicable.
  - name: actionTarget
    description: Pointer to the target of the action that triggered the proc. May
      represent the primary target or affected unit in combat.
  - name: procTarget
    description: Pointer to the entity that will receive the proc effect (e.g., the
      unit that receives a triggered spell).
  - name: typeMask
    description: Bitmask indicating the type of proc event being processed. Defines
      whether it's a damage, heal, or other type of event.
  - name: spellTypeMask
    description: Enumeration mask specifying the spell type (SpellType::SPELL, SpellType::DOT,
      etc.) for categorizing the proc event.
  - name: spellPhaseMask
    description: Enumeration mask defining which phase of spell execution triggered
      this proc (e.g., SPELL_PHASE_CAST, SPELL_PHASE_HIT).
  - name: hitMask
    description: Bitmask representing the hit result conditions (e.g., PROC_HIT, PROC_CRIT)
      that occurred during the event.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object associated with this proc event. May
      be null if no spell is directly involved.
  - name: damageInfo
    description: Pointer to DamageInfo structure containing detailed damage calculation
      data for the proc event. Can be null if not applicable.
  - name: healInfo
    description: Pointer to HealInfo structure containing detailed healing calculation
      data for the proc event. Can be null if not applicable.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ProcEventInfo Initialization
    code: ProcEventInfo eventInfo(&caster, &target, &procTarget, typeMask, SpellType::SPELL,
      SPELL_PHASE_HIT, PROC_HIT, spell, nullptr, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: ProcEventInfo with Damage Information
    code: ProcEventInfo eventInfo(&attacker, &defender, &procTarget, typeMask, SpellType::DOT,
      SPELL_PHASE_CAST, PROC_CRIT, spell, &damageInfo, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore combat system
    and should not be called directly in most custom scripts or modules. The parameters
    are expected to be valid pointers; passing null values may lead to undefined behavior
    if not handled properly by downstream code. The method does not perform any validation
    on input parameters.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the typeMask or spellPhaseMask can result in proc
    events being filtered out or processed incorrectly. Ensure all pointer parameters
    are valid before calling this constructor, as null dereferences may occur during
    event processing if not properly initialized.
