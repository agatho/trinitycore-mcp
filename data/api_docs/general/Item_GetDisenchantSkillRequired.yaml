  class: Item
  method: GetDisenchantSkillRequired
  signature: int Item::GetDisenchantSkillRequired() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the required disenchant skill level for disenchanted items.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum skill level required to disenchant
    an item. The returned value represents the skill requirement necessary for a player
    to successfully disenchant the item, which is typically used in conjunction with
    the Disenchanting system. This method is commonly used in determining whether
    a player has sufficient skill to disenchanted items, especially when considering
    the game mechanics of disenchanting and the associated loot tables.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the required skill level for disenchanting
    this item. A value of 0 indicates that no skill is required, while higher values
    indicate increasing skill requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nint requiredSkill = item->GetDisenchantSkillRequired();\n\
      if (requiredSkill > 0)\n{\n    // Player needs to have at least requiredSkill\
      \ skill level\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Item class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other item-related methods such as GetDisenchantLootTemplate or GetDisenchantingPlayer.
    It may be used in determining whether a player can disenchant an item based on
    their skill level, and should be considered when implementing game mechanics related
    to disenchanting.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the item actually has a disenchant
    template; it simply returns the skill requirement associated with the item. If
    an item is not disenchanted, this value may not reflect actual gameplay requirements.
