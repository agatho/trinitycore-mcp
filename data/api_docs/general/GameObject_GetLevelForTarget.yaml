documentation:
  brief: Returns the level of the GameObject target for use in spell effects.
  description: The GetLevelForTarget method retrieves the level of a GameObject target,
    which is used primarily in spell effect calculations. This method is typically
    invoked when determining the effective level of a target for spells that require
    level-based calculations. The returned value represents the level at which the
    GameObject should be considered for spell effects, particularly those involving
    targeting or level-based mechanics. It may be used in conjunction with other methods
    to determine appropriate target levels for various game mechanics such as area-of-effect
    spells, damage calculations, or target selection.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's level or a reference
      to a GameObject. This parameter is typically used to determine the effective
      level of the GameObject for spell effects, where the value may be negative or
      positive depending on how the target is defined.
  returns: Represents the level of the GameObject as determined by the target parameter,
    typically ranging from 1 to 255. The return value indicates the effective level
    used in spell calculations for targeting purposes, and can be used to determine
    whether a spell should apply effects based on the target's level or to calculate
    damage modifiers based on level differences.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint8 level = gameObject->GetLevelForTarget(&target);\nif (level > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use level in spell calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with target level calculation
    code: 'int targetLevel = 10;

      uint8 level = gameObject->GetLevelForTarget(&targetLevel);

      // This might be used in spell effect calculations

      // where level determines the effectiveness of the spell

      // based on the target''s level'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with spell effect calculations
    and may involve complex game mechanics related to level-based targeting. Implementation
    details include how the target level is interpreted, and whether it's a direct
    reference or an indirect calculation based on other parameters.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may depend on specific game
    mechanics involving target levels. Incorrect usage can lead to inaccurate spell
    effects or incorrect targeting behavior. The value returned may vary depending
    on how the target is defined, so developers should ensure proper handling of target
    references.
