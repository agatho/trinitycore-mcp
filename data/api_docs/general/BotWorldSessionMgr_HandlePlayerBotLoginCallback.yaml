  class: BotWorldSessionMgr
  method: HandlePlayerBotLoginCallback
  signature: void BotWorldSessionMgr::HandlePlayerBotLoginCallback(const SQLQueryHolderBase
    & holder, uint32 masterAccountId, int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the login callback for a player bot, handling account and character
    data retrieval from the database.
  description: The HandlePlayerBotLoginCallback method is invoked when a player bot
    successfully logs into the game world. It processes the SQL query results provided
    by the SQLQueryHolderBase parameter to retrieve and initialize bot-specific data
    associated with the given master account ID and player GUID. This method ensures
    that all necessary information for the bot's operation, such as character stats,
    inventory, and behavior settings, is properly loaded from the database. The method
    typically follows a login sequence where initial authentication has been completed
    but further data loading is required before the bot can be fully operational in
    the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: holder
    description: A reference to an SQLQueryHolderBase object containing the results
      of database queries related to the player bot's account and character data.
      This holder typically includes queries for character information, inventory,
      skills, and other relevant data needed for bot initialization.
  - name: masterAccountId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the master account that owns this player
      bot. This ID is used to associate the bot with its owner's account settings
      and permissions within the game system.
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player character associated
      with the bot. This GUID uniquely identifies the specific bot character in the
      database and is used for all subsequent operations involving that character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void BotWorldSessionMgr::HandlePlayerBotLoginCallback(const SQLQueryHolderBase&\
      \ holder, uint32 masterAccountId, int playerGuid)\n{\n    // Process the database\
      \ query results\n    if (holder.GetResult(0))\n    {\n        // Load character\
      \ data\n        Field* fields = holder.GetResult(0)->Fetch();\n        // Initialize\
      \ bot with retrieved data\n        // ...\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called asynchronously after a successful authentication
    process. It assumes that the SQLQueryHolderBase contains valid query results and
    that the masterAccountId and playerGuid parameters are properly validated before
    being passed to this method. The method may perform additional database lookups
    or data processing depending on the specific implementation details of the bot
    system.
  warnings: Improper handling of the SQLQueryHolderBase can lead to crashes or incorrect
    data loading. Ensure that all queries within the holder have been executed successfully
    and that the provided GUIDs are valid before calling this method. Incorrect use
    of masterAccountId or playerGuid values may result in loading wrong character
    data or permission issues.
