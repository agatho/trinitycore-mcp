documentation:
  brief: Prepares the quest menu for a player based on the provided GUID
  description: The PrepareQuestMenu method is used to initialize and display the quest
    menu for a player, typically in response to interacting with an NPC or object.
    This method prepares the necessary data structures and sends the appropriate client
    packets to show the quest menu. It is commonly used during quest interaction scenarios
    where the player needs to be presented with available quests from a specific NPC
    or object. The method handles the internal logic required for quest display, including
    checking if the player has active quests related to the GUID provided.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC or object that the player
      is interacting with. This GUID determines which quests are displayed in the
      menu and is essential for proper quest handling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Menu Preparation
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->PrepareQuestMenu(12345);

      // This prepares the quest menu for a specific NPC or object with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically called internally by TrinityCore's core system when
    a player interacts with an NPC. It should be used in conjunction with other quest-related
    methods like QuestGiverStatus and QuestGiverOfferReward. The method may also trigger
    additional checks for quest availability or completion status.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is actually interacting
    with an NPC or object that has quests available. Calling this method without proper
    context may result in incorrect quest menu display or client-side errors. It's
    important to ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid NPC or object.
