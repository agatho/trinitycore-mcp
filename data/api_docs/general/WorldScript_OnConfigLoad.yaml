  signature: void WorldScript::OnConfigLoad(bool reload)
documentation:
  brief: Executes code when the world configuration is loaded or reloaded
  description: The OnConfigLoad method is a callback function in the WorldScript class
    that is invoked whenever the World of Warcraft server loads or reloads its configuration
    files. This method allows custom scripts to perform initialization or update operations
    based on the current configuration settings. It is typically used to apply settings,
    register event handlers, or adjust server behavior according to loaded configuration
    values. The method is called during server startup and can also be triggered when
    configuration files are reloaded using the /reload command in-game.
  parameters:
  - name: reload
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the configuration is being loaded
      for the first time (false) or reloaded (true). When true, the method should
      handle updating existing configurations rather than performing initial setup.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Configuration Loading
    code: "class MyWorldScript : public WorldScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnConfigLoad(bool\
      \ reload) override\n    {\n        // Load configuration values\n        uint32\
      \ newMaxPlayers = sConfigMgr->GetOption<uint32>(\"MaxPlayers\", 100);\n    \
      \    \n        if (!reload)\n        {\n            // Initial setup\n     \
      \       sWorld->SetMaxPlayerCount(newMaxPlayers);\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Max players set to %u\", newMaxPlayers);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n\
      \            // Reload handling\n            sWorld->SetMaxPlayerCount(newMaxPlayers);\n\
      \            sLog->outString(\"Max players reloaded to %u\", newMaxPlayers);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called from the main server thread and should not perform
    long-running operations that could block the game loop. Configuration changes
    made during reload may affect active players, so care must be taken to ensure
    safe updates.
  warnings: Avoid performing expensive operations in this method as it can impact
    server startup time or reload performance. Be cautious when modifying global server
    settings during a reload, as it might cause unexpected behavior for connected
    players.
