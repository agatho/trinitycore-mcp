  class: BattlefieldMgr
  method: operator=
  signature: BattlefieldMgr & BattlefieldMgr::operator=(BattlefieldMgr && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a BattlefieldMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to
    the target object.
  description: The operator= method implements move assignment for the BattlefieldMgr
    class. It transfers all managed resources from the source BattlefieldMgr object
    (passed as an rvalue reference) to the current object, leaving the source object
    in a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used when assigning
    one BattlefieldMgr instance to another, particularly in scenarios involving temporary
    objects or container operations where resource transfer is more efficient than
    copying. The method ensures proper cleanup of existing resources before transferring
    new ones, maintaining the integrity of the battlefield management system within
    TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An rvalue reference to another BattlefieldMgr object whose resources
      will be moved to this object. After the operation, param0 will be left in a
      valid but unspecified state.
  returns: A reference to the current BattlefieldMgr object (this) after the move
    assignment has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'BattlefieldMgr manager1;

      BattlefieldMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Uses operator=

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // manager2 contains all resources previously owned by manager1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Context
    code: 'std::vector<BattlefieldMgr> managers;

      managers.emplace_back(); // Default construct

      BattlefieldMgr tempManager;

      managers[0] = std::move(tempManager); // Move assignment

      // tempManager is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for BattlefieldMgr.
    It should only be called with rvalue references to avoid unnecessary copying.
    The move operation typically involves transferring pointers or handles rather
    than deep-copying data, making it more efficient than copy assignment.
  warnings: Calling this operator with an lvalue reference will result in a compilation
    error as the method expects an rvalue reference. Be cautious when using this with
    temporary objects that may be destroyed immediately after the move operation.
