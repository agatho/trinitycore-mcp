  class: EnergyChiResource
  method: GetMax
  signature: uint32 EnergyChiResource::GetMax() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum energy or chi value for the resource.
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of the energy or chi resource
    for a player or creature. This value represents the maximum amount of energy or
    chi that can be stored in the resource pool. The returned value is typically used
    to determine resource capacity, display maximum values in UI elements, and calculate
    resource regeneration rates. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    this method is commonly used for classes that utilize energy-based or chi-based
    resource systems such as monks, rogues, or other specializations with energy mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum capacity of the energy or chi resource.
    This value is typically a fixed amount based on class, level, and any applicable
    buffs or talents that modify resource capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 maxEnergy = player->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY)->GetMax();

      uint32 maxChi = player->GetPower(POWER_CHI)->GetMax();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Capacity Check
    code: "if (player->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY)->GetMax() > 100)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ actions based on high energy capacity\n    player->ModifyPower(POWER_ENERGY,\
      \ 50);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PowerResource system in TrinityCore. The returned
    value may be modified by various game mechanics including buffs, debuffs, talents,
    and class-specific abilities. For accurate resource calculations, always consider
    that this value can change during gameplay through various modifiers.
  warnings: Be aware that some classes may have dynamic maximum resource values that
    change based on level progression or special abilities. Always verify the current
    state of resource modifications before making assumptions about maximum capacity.
