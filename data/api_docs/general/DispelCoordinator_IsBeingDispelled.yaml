  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: IsBeingDispelled
  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::IsBeingDispelled(int target, uint32 auraId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target is currently being dispelled by a specific aura.
  description: The IsBeingDispelled method determines whether a given target unit
    is currently under the effect of a dispel operation for a specific aura type.
    This functionality is typically used within the context of spell mechanics and
    aura management to prevent duplicate dispels or to enforce dispel logic. The method
    evaluates the internal state of the DispelCoordinator to determine if the specified
    aura is actively being removed from the target.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The unit identifier (GUID) of the target being checked for active
      dispel status.
  - name: auraId
    description: The unique identifier of the aura type being checked for active dispel
      status.
  returns: Returns true if the specified target is currently being dispelled by the
    given aura; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator.IsBeingDispelled(playerGuid, 12345)) {\n    // Player\
      \ is already being dispelled by aura 12345\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Dispel Logic
    code: "if (!dispelCoordinator.IsBeingDispelled(victimGuid, auraType)) {\n    //\
      \ Apply dispel effect\n    Spell* spell = new Spell(caster, target, SpellInfo);\n\
      \    spell->Prepare();\n} else {\n    // Skip dispel as it's already in progress\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of dispel states. It should be used
    carefully to avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments. The implementation
    assumes that auraId and target are valid identifiers within the current context.
  warnings: Ensure that both target GUID and auraId are valid before calling this
    method, as invalid values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
