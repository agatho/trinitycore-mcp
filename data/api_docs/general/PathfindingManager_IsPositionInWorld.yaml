  class: PathfindingManager
  method: IsPositionInWorld
  signature: bool PathfindingManager::IsPositionInWorld(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a given position is within the valid world boundaries.
  description: The IsPositionInWorld method verifies if a specified position, represented
    by an integer identifier, lies within the valid boundaries of the game world.
    This is crucial for pathfinding operations to ensure that navigation requests
    are made only for positions that exist within the game's playable area. The method
    typically performs boundary checks against predefined world limits and may also
    validate against terrain or other environmental constraints. It is commonly used
    by the PathfindingManager to filter out invalid destinations before attempting
    to calculate paths.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a position in the game world.
      This value typically corresponds to a unique coordinate or node identifier within
      the pathfinding system's internal representation.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is within valid world boundaries,
    false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the position either lies
    outside the playable area or is not recognized by the pathfinding system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate a pathfinding destination
    code: "if (pathfindingManager.IsPositionInWorld(destinationNode)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with path calculation\n    pathfindingManager.CalculatePath(startNode, destinationNode);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle invalid destination\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Invalid\
      \ destination node: {}\", destinationNode);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs fast boundary checks using precomputed world
    limits rather than detailed terrain validation. The integer parameter 'pos' may
    represent either a node ID in a navigation mesh or a coordinate value encoded
    in a specific format used internally by TrinityCore's pathfinding system.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed to this method is valid and
    corresponds to an actual node or coordinate within the pathfinding system. Passing
    invalid identifiers may lead to unexpected behavior or errors during path calculation.
