  class: InterruptDatabase
  method: LoadDungeonOverrides
  signature: void InterruptDatabase::LoadDungeonOverrides(uint32 mapId)
documentation:
  brief: Loads dungeon override data for the specified map ID into the interrupt database.
  description: The LoadDungeonOverrides method initializes and populates dungeon-specific
    interrupt data for a given map ID within the InterruptDatabase. This functionality
    is typically used during server startup or map loading to ensure that dungeon-specific
    interrupt behaviors, such as spell interruptions or ability overrides, are correctly
    configured for the specified map. The method likely retrieves configuration data
    from database tables or configuration files related to dungeon mechanics and applies
    these settings to the internal data structures of the InterruptDatabase. This
    ensures that players engaging with dungeon content experience the correct interrupt
    handling based on the dungeon's unique rules and mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map for which dungeon overrides should
      be loaded. This value typically corresponds to a valid map entry in the game's
      database, representing a specific dungeon or instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load Overrides for a Specific Dungeon
    code: InterruptDatabase::LoadDungeonOverrides(1234); // Loads overrides for map
      ID 1234 (e.g., a specific dungeon)
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during server initialization or when loading
    a new map instance. It may involve database queries to fetch dungeon-specific
    interrupt configurations, which could impact performance if many dungeons are
    loaded simultaneously. The method should be thread-safe as it's typically invoked
    during startup phases.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided mapId corresponds to an actual valid map in the
    database; otherwise, the method might not load any data or could cause unexpected
    behavior. Avoid calling this method during active gameplay sessions unless necessary,
    as it may disrupt existing interrupt states.
