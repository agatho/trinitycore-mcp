  method: SetCyclic
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetCyclic()
documentation:
  brief: Enables cyclic movement for a spline, causing the movement to loop continuously.
  description: The SetCyclic method configures the MoveSplineInit object to create
    a cyclic movement path, where the spline will repeat its motion indefinitely after
    reaching the end point. This is commonly used for objects or creatures that need
    to move in a continuous loop, such as rotating platforms, moving trains, or looping
    patrol routes. The method modifies internal state flags within the spline initialization
    to indicate that the path should be treated as cyclic. Once called, subsequent
    calls to the spline's movement functions will cause the entity to loop through
    the defined waypoints continuously until explicitly stopped.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cyclic Movement Setup
    code: 'MoveSplineInit init;

      init.SetCyclic();

      // Configure waypoints and start movement

      init.MoveTo(positions);

      // The movement will now loop continuously'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before setting up the actual movement path using
    methods like MoveTo() or SetPoint(). The cyclic behavior only applies to splines
    that are initialized with a complete path and not to single-point movements. Performance-wise,
    cyclic movement requires additional state tracking but typically has minimal overhead.
  warnings: Calling SetCyclic() on a spline that is already in motion may produce
    undefined behavior. Always ensure the spline is in an uninitialized or stopped
    state before calling this method. Also, be cautious with very large or complex
    paths as continuous looping might cause performance issues if not properly managed.
