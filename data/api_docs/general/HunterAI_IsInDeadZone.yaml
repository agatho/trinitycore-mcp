  class: HunterAI
  method: IsInDeadZone
  signature: bool HunterAI::IsInDeadZone(int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the hunter's current target is within the dead zone range.
  description: The IsInDeadZone method evaluates if the hunter's current target is
    positioned within a specific angular range relative to the hunter's facing direction,
    typically used to determine if a target is in a 'dead zone' where the hunter cannot
    effectively shoot or should avoid shooting. This method is crucial for AI decision-making
    in hunter behavior, particularly when determining optimal positioning and shot
    selection. The method considers the hunter's orientation and the target's position
    to calculate whether the target lies within an angular threshold that defines
    the dead zone.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's ID or index. This
      parameter is used to identify which target to evaluate against the hunter's
      dead zone.
  returns: Returns true if the specified target is within the hunter's defined dead
    zone, indicating that the hunter should not shoot at this target due to positioning
    constraints. Returns false otherwise, meaning the target is outside the dead zone
    and can be targeted normally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (!hunterAI->IsInDeadZone(&targetId)) {\n    // Proceed with shooting\
      \ at target\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHOOT, true);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Avoid shooting and consider repositioning\n    hunter->SetFacingToObject(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with movement logic
    code: "if (hunterAI->IsInDeadZone(&targetId)) {\n    // Move to a better position\
      \ before attacking\n    hunter->MoveTo(x, y, z, true);\n} else if (hunter->IsWithinLOS(target))\
      \ {\n    // Normal attack sequence\n    hunter->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHOOT,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses trigonometric calculations to determine angular relationships
    between the hunter and target. It may be affected by the hunter's current facing
    direction and the target's position in 3D space. The dead zone angle threshold
    is probably configurable via game settings or AI parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the target ID passed into this method is valid and represents
    an active target. Passing an invalid or null target pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect AI decisions.
