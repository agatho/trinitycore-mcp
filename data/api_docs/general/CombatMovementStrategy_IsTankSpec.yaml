documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified talent tree corresponds to a tanking specialization.
  description: The IsTankSpec method evaluates a given talent tree identifier to determine
    if it represents a tanking specialization within World of Warcraft. This functionality
    is crucial for AI behavior in combat movement strategies, particularly when deciding
    whether an NPC or player should assume a defensive stance or prioritize threat
    generation. The method checks against predefined talent tree IDs that are associated
    with tanking roles such as Protection Paladin, Arms Warrior, or Bear Form Druid.
    It returns true if the talent tree matches a known tanking specialization, and
    false otherwise. This check is often used in conjunction with other combat movement
    decisions to optimize NPC behavior during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided talentTree parameter corresponds to a tanking
    specialization; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (strategy->IsTankSpec(256)) {\n    // This is a Protection Paladin talent\
      \ tree\n    // Execute tank-specific movement behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Movement Logic
    code: "void CombatMovementStrategy::UpdateAI(Unit* target) {\n    if (IsTankSpec(GetPlayerTalentTree()))\
      \ {\n        // Apply defensive positioning and threat management\n        MoveToTargetWithDefensiveStance(target);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply offensive or support movement patterns\n   \
      \     MoveToTargetWithOffensiveStrategy(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on hardcoded talent tree identifiers that may vary between
    game versions. Developers should verify the correctness of these values against
    current TrinityCore database or client data. The method assumes that talentTree
    parameter is valid and corresponds to a legitimate specialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the talentTree parameter passed to this method is actually
    a valid talent tree ID from the game's talent system. Passing invalid or unexpected
    values may lead to incorrect behavior in combat movement decisions.
