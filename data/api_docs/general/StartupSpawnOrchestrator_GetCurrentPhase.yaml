  class: StartupSpawnOrchestrator
  method: GetCurrentPhase
  signature: StartupPhase StartupSpawnOrchestrator::GetCurrentPhase() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current startup phase of the orchestrator.
  description: The GetCurrentPhase method returns the current StartupPhase enum value
    that represents the active phase in the startup spawn orchestration process. This
    phase indicates what stage of initialization the spawn system is currently in,
    which helps determine when certain objects or events can be safely spawned or
    activated. The method is const and does not modify any internal state of the StartupSpawnOrchestrator
    instance. It's typically used by the core game loop to coordinate spawning sequences
    based on the current phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a StartupPhase enum value indicating the current startup phase
    of the orchestrator. Possible values may include PHASE_NONE, PHASE_PREPARE, PHASE_SPAWN,
    or PHASE_COMPLETE depending on the internal state and progression of the spawn
    initialization sequence.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Startup Phase
    code: "StartupPhase currentPhase = orchestrator.GetCurrentPhase();\nif (currentPhase\
      \ == StartupPhase::PHASE_SPAWN)\n{\n    // Proceed with spawning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable state. The returned
    StartupPhase value should be checked before performing any phase-specific operations
    to ensure proper sequencing of spawn events.
