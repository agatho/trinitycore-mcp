  class: SafeExecutionEngine

  signature: bool SafeExecutionEngine::HandleError(uint32 errorCode, const std::string
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Handles and processes error codes within the safe execution engine, returning
    true if the error was successfully managed.
  description: The HandleError method in the SafeExecutionEngine class is responsible
    for managing error conditions that occur during safe execution contexts. It takes
    an error code and context string as input, processes the error according to internal
    logic, and returns a boolean indicating whether the error was successfully handled.
    This method is typically used in scenarios where code execution needs to be protected
    from exceptions or invalid states, particularly in game systems where robustness
    and stability are critical. The method may log errors, trigger fallback mechanisms,
    or perform cleanup operations depending on the specific error code and context
    provided.
  parameters:
  - name: errorCode
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the type of error that occurred.
      This value is used to determine how the error should be processed and handled
      within the engine.
  - name: context
    description: A string providing additional information about where and why the
      error occurred. This context helps in debugging and logging by giving more details
      about the execution environment when the error was triggered.
  returns: Returns true if the error was successfully handled by the engine, false
    otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that the error could not
    be managed or that the error code is unrecognized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling
    code: "SafeExecutionEngine engine;\nuint32 error = 1001;\nbool result = engine.HandleError(error,\
      \ \"Player login failed\");\nif (!result) {\n    // Handle unhandled error\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Unhandled error: %u\", error);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update() {\n    SafeExecutionEngine engine;\n    try {\n\
      \        // Some game logic that might fail\n        ProcessPlayerActions();\n\
      \    } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n        bool handled = engine.HandleError(9999,\
      \ \"Game loop exception\");\n        if (!handled) {\n            sWorld->ShutdownGracefully();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a safety mechanism designed to prevent crashes in
    critical game systems. It's recommended that developers implement proper logging
    when errors are not handled successfully. The method may be called from multiple
    threads, so thread safety considerations should be taken into account if custom
    error handling logic is implemented.
  warnings: Do not assume all error codes are handled by this method. Always check
    the return value to ensure proper error management. Improper use of this method
    can lead to unhandled exceptions or silent failures in critical systems.
