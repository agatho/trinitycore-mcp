  signature: void Unit::CancelMountAura(bool force)
documentation:
  brief: Cancel the mount aura on the unit, removing the effect of mounted state.
  description: This method removes the mount aura from a Unit, effectively breaking
    the mounted state and allowing the unit to move normally. It is typically used
    when a player or creature needs to be unmounted, either due to combat or other
    game mechanics. The force parameter determines whether the cancellation should
    happen regardless of any restrictions or conditions. If force is true, the mount
    aura will be removed even if the unit is in combat or otherwise restricted. If
    false, the method respects normal game rules and will not cancel the aura if the
    unit is in a state where it cannot be unmounted.
  parameters:
  - name: force
    description: If true, forces cancellation of the mount aura regardless of game
      restrictions. If false, respects normal game mechanics and will only cancel
      the aura when the unit can be unmounted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->CancelMountAura(false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced cancellation example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player->GetUnit();

      unit->CancelMountAura(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to ensure proper state management. It may be called during combat or when
    transitioning between different states. Implementation details include checking
    for existing mount aura and removing it from the unit's aura list.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause unexpected behavior in movement
    or combat state. Care should be taken when using force=true to avoid breaking
    game rules or causing unintended consequences.
