  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: HasProgressStalled
  signature: bool ObjectiveTracker::HasProgressStalled(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest objective has stalled in progress for a specified
    player.
  description: The HasProgressStalled method checks if a specific quest objective,
    identified by its index, has become stagnant or unprogressed for a given player.
    This is typically used in AI behavior systems to detect when a bot's quest progress
    has halted, which may indicate the need for alternative actions or quest updates.
    The method evaluates the current state of the quest objective against expected
    progression and returns true if no progress has been made within a defined threshold.
    It is commonly utilized in automated questing systems to prevent bots from getting
    stuck on objectives that cannot be completed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest progress
      is being evaluated.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective to check
      for stalled progress.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest to evaluate for
      stalled progress.
  returns: Returns true if the specified quest objective has stalled in progress;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a bot's quest objective is stalled
    code: "if (objectiveTracker.HasProgressStalled(bot, 12345, 0)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ stalled objective\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Quest objective\
      \ has stalled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in AI questing logic
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateQuestProgress() {\n    for (uint32 i = 0; i < bot->GetQuestStatusMap().size();\
      \ ++i) {\n        if (objectiveTracker.HasProgressStalled(bot, i, 0)) {\n  \
      \          // Attempt to re-activate or abandon quest\n            bot->FailQuest(i);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of objective completion times
    and progress deltas. It may be used in conjunction with other AI systems to determine
    when a bot should abandon or retry a quest. The exact threshold for what constitutes
    'stalled' progress is implementation-defined within the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and that the questId and
    objectiveIndex are within bounds to prevent undefined behavior. This method may
    not be thread-safe if used in concurrent environments without proper locking mechanisms.
