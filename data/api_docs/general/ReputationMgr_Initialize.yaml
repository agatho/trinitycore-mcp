  class: ReputationMgr
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ReputationMgr::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the reputation manager for a player, setting up default faction
    standings and internal data structures.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the ReputationMgr object for use by
    loading default faction standings, initializing internal data structures, and
    ensuring all required reputation entries are present for the associated player.
    This method is typically called during player login or creation to establish the
    initial state of the player's reputation system. It ensures that each faction
    has a valid standing entry with appropriate default values, such as neutral or
    friendly standings depending on the faction type. The initialization process also
    handles any necessary synchronization between the in-memory reputation data and
    the database state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();

      repMgr->Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session, typically during
    the login process. It is not thread-safe and must be executed on the main game
    thread. The initialization process may involve database queries to fetch or create
    default reputation entries for factions that do not yet exist in the player's
    record.
  warnings: Calling Initialize multiple times on the same ReputationMgr instance can
    lead to inconsistent state or duplicate data entries. This method should never
    be invoked during combat or while other reputation-related operations are in progress,
    as it may cause race conditions or data corruption.
