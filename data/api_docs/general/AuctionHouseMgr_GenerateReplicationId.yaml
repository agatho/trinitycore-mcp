  class: AuctionHouseMgr
  method: GenerateReplicationId
  signature: uint32 AuctionHouseMgr::GenerateReplicationId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique replication identifier for auction house data synchronization.
  description: The GenerateReplicationId method creates and returns a unique 32-bit
    integer identifier used to track and synchronize auction house data across different
    realms or instances in a TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft server. This identifier
    is typically employed in replication mechanisms to ensure that auction house updates
    are properly tracked and applied consistently. The generated ID is expected to
    be unique within the context of the auction house manager's scope, preventing
    conflicts during data synchronization processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A unique 32-bit unsigned integer identifier that serves as a replication
    token for auction house data operations. This value should be treated as opaque
    and used solely for tracking purposes in synchronization logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 replicationId = sAuctionHouseMgr->GenerateReplicationId();

      // Use replicationId to track auction house data changes

      TC_LOG_DEBUG(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Generated replication ID: %u", replicationId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the auction house system for maintaining
    consistency across multiple realms or instances. The implementation may utilize
    internal counters or hash-based generation to ensure uniqueness.
