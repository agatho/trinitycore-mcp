  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: SetBloodlustAlignment
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::SetBloodlustAlignment(bool align)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the bloodlust alignment flag for cooldown stacking optimization.
  description: Configures whether the cooldown stacking optimizer should align with
    bloodlust effects when calculating optimal ability usage. This setting affects
    how the AI prioritizes abilities that benefit from or are affected by bloodlust,
    such as increased attack speed or mana regeneration. The method directly modifies
    an internal flag within the CooldownStackingOptimizer class that influences subsequent
    cooldown calculations and ability selection decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bloodlust Alignment
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetBloodlustAlignment(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bloodlust Alignment
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.SetBloodlustAlignment(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or configuration phases
    of a class that uses cooldown stacking optimization. The alignment setting may
    influence performance if used in high-frequency decision-making contexts, though
    the impact should be minimal as it only sets an internal flag.
