documentation:
  brief: Moves a CreatureGroup object, transferring ownership of its resources to
    the new instance.
  description: The CreatureGroup move constructor transfers all resources from the
    source CreatureGroup object to the newly created instance. This operation is typically
    used when creating new CreatureGroup objects by moving existing ones, avoiding
    expensive deep copies. The source object becomes invalid after the move and should
    not be used. This constructor is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics
    implementation for the CreatureGroup class, enabling efficient resource management
    in scenarios involving temporary objects or container operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Construction Example
    code: 'CreatureGroup group1;

      // ... initialize group1 ...

      CreatureGroup group2 = std::move(group1); // Moves resources from group1 to
      group2

      // group1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is implicitly defined by the compiler when no user-defined
    move constructor exists. It performs a member-wise move of all base class and
    member objects, which is efficient for classes containing pointers or smart pointers.
    The moved-from object should not be accessed after the move operation.
  warnings: After calling this move constructor, the source CreatureGroup object is
    left in a valid but unspecified state. Attempting to use the source object afterward
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that no other code relies on
    the source object's state after the move.
