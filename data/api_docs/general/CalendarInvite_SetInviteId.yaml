documentation:
  brief: Sets the unique identifier for a calendar invite
  description: The SetInviteId method assigns a unique 64-bit identifier to a calendar
    invite object. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore to track and
    manage calendar invitations within the game's calendar system. The method typically
    sets an ID that corresponds to the invite's position in the database or its association
    with a specific calendar event. This ID is crucial for linking invites to their
    respective events and ensuring proper synchronization between client and server
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: inviteId
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier for
      the calendar invite
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Invite ID for a Calendar Event
    code: 'CalendarInvite* invite = new CalendarInvite();

      invite->SetInviteId(1234567890ULL);

      // The invite now has the identifier 1234567890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning ID During Invite Creation
    code: "void CreateCalendarInvite(uint64 eventId, uint64 playerId) {\n    CalendarInvite*\
      \ invite = new CalendarInvite();\n    invite->SetInviteId(eventId + (playerId\
      \ << 32)); // Combine event and player IDs\n    // Further processing of the\
      \ invite...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization or creation of
    calendar invites. The invite ID should be unique within the context of the calendar
    system to prevent conflicts. The implementation likely stores this value in a
    private member variable and may trigger internal updates to related data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the inviteId parameter is valid and unique before calling
    this method, as duplicate IDs could cause synchronization issues or data corruption
    in the calendar system. This method does not validate the uniqueness of the ID
    internally.
