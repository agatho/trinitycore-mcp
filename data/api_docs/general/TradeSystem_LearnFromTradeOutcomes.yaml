  class: TradeSystem
  method: LearnFromTradeOutcomes
  signature: void TradeSystem::LearnFromTradeOutcomes(Player * player, uint32 sessionId,
    bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Updates player's trade skill learning state based on successful or failed
    trade outcomes.
  description: The LearnFromTradeOutcomes method is responsible for processing the
    results of trade transactions to determine whether a player should gain experience
    or improve their trade skills. This method evaluates if a trade session was successful
    and updates the player's trade skill data accordingly. It typically gets invoked
    after a trade completes, either successfully or unsuccessfully, to adjust the
    player's proficiency in relevant trade skills such as Blacksmithing, Leatherworking,
    etc. The method ensures that players receive appropriate feedback and progression
    from their trading activities within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose trade skills will be updated based
      on the outcome of the trade session.
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific trade session being processed.
      Used to track and correlate trade outcomes with player actions.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the trade session completed successfully
      (true) or failed (false). Determines how the player's trade skills are adjusted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trade Completion Handler
    code: "void OnTradeComplete(Player* player, uint32 sessionId, bool success) {\n\
      \    TradeSystem::LearnFromTradeOutcomes(player, sessionId, success);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Skill Learning Based on Outcome
    code: "if (tradeResult == TRADE_SUCCESS) {\n    TradeSystem::LearnFromTradeOutcomes(player,\
      \ tradeSessionId, true);\n} else {\n    TradeSystem::LearnFromTradeOutcomes(player,\
      \ tradeSessionId, false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal skill learning systems and may
    trigger updates to player's skill bars or notifications. It assumes that the player
    object is valid and that the session ID corresponds to an active trade in progress.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null reference could lead to undefined behavior. Also, make sure
    the sessionId is valid and refers to a currently active trade session to avoid
    incorrect skill adjustments.
