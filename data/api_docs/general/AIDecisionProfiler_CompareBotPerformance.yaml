    botGuid2) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares the performance of two AI bots and returns a numerical score representing
    their relative effectiveness.
  description: The CompareBotPerformance method evaluates and quantifies the comparative
    performance between two AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore framework. It
    typically analyzes various metrics such as decision-making efficiency, combat
    effectiveness, resource utilization, or task completion rates to compute a normalized
    score. This score can be used for bot optimization, performance benchmarking,
    or balancing AI difficulty levels in World of Warcraft environments. The method
    assumes that both bots have been initialized and are actively participating in
    the game world, with their performance data available for comparison.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the comparative performance score between the
    two bots. A positive value indicates that bot1 outperforms bot2, a negative value
    indicates that bot2 outperforms bot1, and a value near zero suggests similar performance
    levels. The exact scale and interpretation of this value depend on internal implementation
    details of the profiler.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Comparison
    code: "double score = profiler.CompareBotPerformance(12345, 67890);\nif (score\
      \ > 0.0) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot 1 is performing better than Bot 2\" << std::endl;\n\
      } else if (score < 0.0) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot 2 is performing better than\
      \ Bot 1\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"Both bots are performing\
      \ similarly\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires that both bot GUIDs correspond to valid, active AI-controlled
    entities in the game world. The performance metrics used for comparison may vary
    depending on the specific implementation of AIDecisionProfiler and could include
    factors like combat actions per second, quest completion rate, or pathfinding
    efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided bot GUIDs are valid and refer to bots currently
    managed by the AI system. Calling this method with invalid or inactive GUIDs may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect performance scores.
