documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GroupThreatStatus object with default values.
  description: The GroupThreatStatus constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GroupThreatStatus class. This method sets up the internal state of the threat
    status tracking system for a group, typically used in the context of World of
    Warcraft's combat mechanics and threat management. The constructor ensures that
    all member variables are properly initialized to their default states, which may
    include setting initial threat levels, clearing any existing threat data, and
    preparing the object for use in threat calculations or updates within the TrinityCore
    framework.

  - title: Creating a new GroupThreatStatus instance
    code: 'GroupThreatStatus threatStatus;

      // The object is now initialized and ready for use in threat management'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    when creating new threat status objects for groups. Developers should not need
    to explicitly call this constructor unless implementing custom threat management
    logic. The initialization process may involve setting up internal data structures
    that track threat levels of group members.
