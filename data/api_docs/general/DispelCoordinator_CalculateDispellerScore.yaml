    & dispeller, const DebuffTarget & target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a scoring value for a dispeller based on its capability and target
    debuff properties
  description: The CalculateDispellerScore method evaluates how effectively a given
    dispeller can remove or mitigate a specific debuff from a target. This calculation
    considers various factors such as the dispeller's ability strength, the type and
    severity of the debuff, and potentially the target's resistance or vulnerability
    to dispels. The resulting score is used by the DispelCoordinator to determine
    optimal dispel actions in combat scenarios, particularly for AI-driven dispel
    decisions. The method does not modify any internal state and is designed to be
    called iteratively during dispel decision-making processes.
  parameters:
  - name: dispeller
    description: A reference to the DispellerCapability object representing the abilities
      and characteristics of the entity attempting to dispel a debuff
  - name: target
    description: A reference to the DebuffTarget object containing information about
      the debuff being considered for removal and the target's current state
  returns: A floating-point value representing the calculated effectiveness score
    of the dispeller against the specified target debuff. Higher scores typically
    indicate better suitability or higher probability of successful dispel.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dispel decision logic
    code: "float score = dispelCoordinator.CalculateDispellerScore(dispellerCap, debuffTarget);\n\
      if (score > 0.7f) {\n    // Consider using this dispeller for the current debuff\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing multiple dispellers for optimal choice
    code: "float bestScore = 0.0f;\nDispellerCapability* bestDispeller = nullptr;\n\
      for (auto& dispeller : availableDispellers) {\n    float score = dispelCoordinator.CalculateDispellerScore(dispeller,\
      \ targetDebuff);\n    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n\
      \        bestDispeller = &dispeller;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestDispeller for the\
      \ dispel action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other AI decision-making systems
    within TrinityCore's combat logic. The scoring algorithm may incorporate factors
    like spell power, dispel type (magic, disease, poison, curse), target's resistance
    values, and debuff duration. It is recommended to cache results when performing
    multiple comparisons for the same dispeller/target combination to avoid redundant
    calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes valid input parameters; passing null or invalid references
    may lead to undefined behavior. The scoring system may evolve with game updates,
    so relying on specific numerical values should be done cautiously.
