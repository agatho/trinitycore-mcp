documentation:
  brief: Toggles the debug scene mode on or off for the SceneMgr instance.
  description: The ToggleDebugSceneMode method switches the internal debug state of
    the SceneMgr class, enabling or disabling detailed scene debugging features. This
    functionality is typically used by developers and administrators to inspect and
    troubleshoot scene-related behaviors in the game world. When enabled, additional
    logging, visualization, or diagnostic information may be displayed for scenes.
    The method does not take any parameters and has no return value. It is generally
    intended for use during development or testing phases rather than in production
    environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Toggle Debug Scene Mode
    code: 'SceneMgr* sceneMgr = sSceneMgr;

      sceneMgr->ToggleDebugSceneMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies an internal boolean flag within the SceneMgr
    class. It may affect performance slightly when enabled due to additional logging
    or rendering overhead. Ensure that this function is only called in appropriate
    contexts such as during development or admin commands.
  warnings: Using this method in a production environment without proper safeguards
    could lead to excessive logging or unintended behavior. Avoid calling it frequently
    in performance-critical code paths.
