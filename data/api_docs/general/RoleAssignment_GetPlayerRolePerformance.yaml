  class: RoleAssignment
  method: GetPlayerRolePerformance
  signature: RolePerformance RoleAssignment::GetPlayerRolePerformance(uint32 playerGuid,
    GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the performance metrics for a player's role within a group context.
  description: The GetPlayerRolePerformance method retrieves detailed performance
    data for a specified player's assigned role in a group. This function is typically
    used in group-based gameplay scenarios such as raids or dungeons where players
    are assigned specific roles (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer). The returned
    RolePerformance object contains statistics and metrics that reflect how well the
    player has performed in their designated role. The method requires a valid player
    GUID and a defined group role to return meaningful data. It is designed to support
    group management systems and performance tracking within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose role performance
      is being retrieved. Must be a valid player GUID within the current session.
  - name: role
    description: The group role assigned to the player (e.g., GROUP_ROLE_TANK, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER,
      GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE). Must be a valid GroupRole enum value.
  returns: A RolePerformance object containing performance metrics for the specified
    player's role. Returns an empty or default RolePerformance object if no data is
    found for the given player and role combination.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "RolePerformance perf = roleAssignment.GetPlayerRolePerformance(12345, GROUP_ROLE_DAMAGE);\n\
      if (perf.IsValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Damage dealt: \" << perf.GetDamageDealt()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis Example
    code: "uint32 playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nRolePerformance perf\
      \ = roleAssignment.GetPlayerRolePerformance(playerId, GROUP_ROLE_HEALER);\n\
      if (perf.GetHealingDone() > 0) {\n    float efficiency = perf.GetHealingDone()\
      \ / perf.GetTimeInCombat();\n    std::cout << \"Healing efficiency: \" << efficiency\
      \ << \" HPS\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player role assignments have been properly initialized
    and maintained within the group system. Performance data is typically updated
    during combat or group activities. The returned RolePerformance object may contain
    zero values if no performance metrics are available for the specified player and
    role.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player GUID or undefined role may
    result in undefined behavior or return default/empty performance data. Ensure
    that player roles are properly assigned before calling this function to avoid
    incorrect performance reporting.
