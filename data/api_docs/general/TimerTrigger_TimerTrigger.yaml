  class: TimerTrigger
  method: TimerTrigger
  signature: void TimerTrigger::TimerTrigger(const std::string & name, uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new timer trigger with the specified name and interval in milliseconds.
  description: The TimerTrigger constructor initializes a timer trigger object with
    a given name and interval. This method sets up the internal state of the timer
    trigger, defining when it should fire based on the provided interval. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI and scripting system, timer triggers are commonly used to
    schedule periodic events or delayed actions within game logic. The interval is
    specified in milliseconds, allowing for precise control over timing behavior.
    This constructor is typically called during object initialization or when dynamically
    creating timed events.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the timer trigger. This name is used
      to reference and manage the timer within the system.
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The time interval in milliseconds between timer firings. Must be
      a positive integer value representing the delay duration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Trigger Initialization
    code: TimerTrigger trigger("MyTimer", 5000); // Creates a timer that fires every
      5 seconds
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Timer Trigger in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Initialize()\n   \
      \ {\n        TimerTrigger attackTimer(\"AttackTimer\", 2000); // Fire every\
      \ 2 seconds\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The timer trigger will not automatically start firing until explicitly activated
    through a separate method call. The interval is stored internally as a uint32
    value, so very large intervals may be truncated or cause unexpected behavior.
    This constructor does not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond
    basic type checking.
  warnings: Do not use negative values for intervalMs as this will result in undefined
    behavior. Be cautious when creating multiple timer triggers with identical names,
    as this may lead to naming conflicts in the system's timer management.
