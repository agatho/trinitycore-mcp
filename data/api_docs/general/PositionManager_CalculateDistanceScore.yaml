api:
  class: PositionManager
  method: CalculateDistanceScore
  signature: float PositionManager::CalculateDistanceScore(const int & pos, const
    MovementContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a distance-based score for a given position within a movement
    context.
  description: The CalculateDistanceScore method computes a normalized score representing
    how favorable a specific position is based on distance metrics within the provided
    movement context. This score is typically used in pathfinding and AI decision-making
    to evaluate potential destinations or waypoints. The method considers factors
    such as proximity to targets, obstacles, and other spatial constraints defined
    by the MovementContext. It returns a floating-point value that can be interpreted
    as a relative preference or cost for selecting the specified position.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the movement
      system. This could correspond to a grid cell, waypoint index, or node identifier
      depending on the implementation details of the PositionManager.
  - name: context
    description: A reference to a MovementContext object that provides contextual
      information about the current state and constraints for movement evaluation.
      This includes target positions, obstacles, terrain data, and other relevant
      environmental factors affecting distance calculations.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated distance score for the given
    position. Higher values typically indicate more favorable positions, while lower
    or negative values may suggest poor choices or penalties based on distance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PositionManager manager;

      MovementContext context;

      int targetPos = 42;

      float score = manager.CalculateDistanceScore(targetPos, context);

      // Use the score to determine next move in pathfinding logic'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Positions
    code: "PositionManager manager;\nMovementContext context;\nstd::vector<float>\
      \ scores;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {\n    float score = manager.CalculateDistanceScore(i,\
      \ context);\n    scores.push_back(score);\n}\n// Find the position with highest\
      \ score for optimal movement\nauto bestIt = std::max_element(scores.begin(),\
      \ scores.end());\nint bestPosition = std::distance(scores.begin(), bestIt);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely performance-critical in AI pathfinding systems and
    should be optimized for frequent calls. The exact scoring algorithm depends on
    the implementation details of MovementContext and how distance metrics are weighted.
    Consider caching results if the same positions are evaluated repeatedly.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter refers to a valid position within the
    system's coordinate space to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect calculations.
    Be cautious when using this method in multi-threaded environments without proper
    synchronization mechanisms.
