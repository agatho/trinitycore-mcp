  class: World
  method: IsShuttingDown
  signature: bool World::IsShuttingDown() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the world server is currently in the process of shutting down.
  description: The IsShuttingDown method returns a boolean value indicating if the
    World server has initiated the shutdown sequence. This flag is typically set when
    the server receives a shutdown command or when a scheduled maintenance event begins.
    During shutdown, the server stops accepting new connections and begins gracefully
    closing existing sessions. The method provides a way for subsystems and modules
    to detect the shutdown state and perform necessary cleanup operations before the
    server terminates completely.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the world server is currently shutting down; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Check
    code: "if (sWorld->IsShuttingDown())\n{\n    // Perform cleanup tasks\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Server is shutting down, skipping updates...\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing New Player Logins During Shutdown
    code: "bool World::CanPlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (IsShuttingDown())\n\
      \    {\n        player->SendNotification(\"Server is shutting down. Please log\
      \ in again after it restarts.\");\n        return false;\n    }\n    return\
      \ true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    shutdown flag is typically set by the main server loop or through administrative
    commands, and it's designed to be checked frequently by various subsystems to
    ensure graceful degradation during shutdown.
