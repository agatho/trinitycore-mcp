documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the GameObject has conditional interaction requirements.
  description: This method checks if a GameObject possesses conditional interaction
    properties that require specific conditions to be met before the object can be
    interacted with. It typically evaluates whether the GameObject's interaction is
    dependent on certain criteria such as player quest completion, faction status,
    or other game mechanics. The method returns true when the GameObject requires
    conditional interaction, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for
    managing dynamic interactions in World of Warcraft environments where objects
    may have different behaviors based on player state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the GameObject has conditional interaction requirements,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the object's interaction
    is dependent on specific conditions being met before it can be interacted with.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (go->HasConditionalInteraction()) {\n    // Handle conditional interaction\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest this method likely checks internal GameObject
    flags or conditions stored in the object's data structure. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this involves simple boolean checks, but may impact when used in
    frequent loops during interaction processing.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with regular interaction methods; it
    specifically identifies conditional requirements rather than general interaction
    capabilities. Common mistake is assuming that all GameObjects with conditional
    interaction also have active conditions.
