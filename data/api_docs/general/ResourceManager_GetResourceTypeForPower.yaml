  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetResourceTypeForPower
  signature: ResourceType ResourceManager::GetResourceTypeForPower(int power)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the resource type associated with a given power type.
  description: The GetResourceTypeForPower method maps a power type identifier to
    its corresponding resource type. In World of Warcraft, powers such as mana, rage,
    energy, and focus are used for different abilities and mechanics. This method
    allows developers to determine which resource type is associated with a specific
    power type, enabling proper handling of resource management systems. The mapping
    is typically defined within the game's internal configuration or power type definitions.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: An integer identifier representing a power type (e.g., POWER_MANA,
      POWER_RAGE, POWER_ENERGY). Valid values are defined by the game's power type
      constants.
  returns: Returns a ResourceType enum value that corresponds to the resource type
    associated with the specified power. Possible return values include RESOURCE_TYPE_MANA,
    RESOURCE_TYPE_RAGE, RESOURCE_TYPE_ENERGY, RESOURCE_TYPE_FOCUS, and others depending
    on the game's implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ResourceType type = resourceManager->GetResourceTypeForPower(POWER_MANA);\n\
      if (type == RESOURCE_TYPE_MANA) {\n    // Handle mana-based resource logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Type Mapping Check
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_POWERS; ++i) {\n    ResourceType resType = resourceManager->GetResourceTypeForPower(i);\n\
      \    printf(\"Power %d maps to resource type %d\\n\", i, resType);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in ability and spell systems where resource
    consumption or generation needs to be handled according to the correct resource
    type. The mapping between power types and resource types is typically static and
    defined at compile-time or during server initialization.
  warnings: Ensure that the input power parameter is within valid range; invalid values
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect resource type mappings. Always validate
    power type constants against the game's official definitions.
