  class: VendorInfo
  method: VendorInfo
  signature: void VendorInfo::VendorInfo(uint32 id, uint32 guid, const std::string
    & name, VendorType type)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new VendorInfo object with specified ID, GUID, name, and vendor
    type.
  description: The VendorInfo constructor initializes a vendor information object
    used in TrinityCore's NPC vendor system. This method sets up essential properties
    for tracking vendor data including the unique identifier (ID), global unique identifier
    (GUID), display name, and the type of vendor. The vendor type determines how the
    vendor behaves in the game world, such as whether it's a regular merchant, a trainer,
    or another specialized vendor type. This constructor is typically called when
    creating new vendor entries in the database or when loading existing vendor data
    from the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the vendor entry in the database. This ID is
      used to reference specific vendor configurations and items.
  - name: guid
    description: Global Unique Identifier of the NPC vendor object. This GUID uniquely
      identifies the specific vendor instance within the game world.
  - name: name
    description: Display name of the vendor as it appears in the game interface. This
      string is shown to players when interacting with the vendor.
  - name: type
    description: VendorType enumeration value that defines the behavior and category
      of this vendor (e.g., regular merchant, trainer, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Basic Vendor Instance
    code: VendorInfo vendor(12345, 67890, "General Store Owner", VendorType::VENDOR_TYPE_NORMAL);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Trainer Vendor
    code: VendorInfo trainer(54321, 98765, "Master of Arcane Arts", VendorType::VENDOR_TYPE_TRAINER);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal vendor management system and should
    not be called directly by most game developers. It's typically invoked during
    server startup when loading vendor data from the database or when creating new
    vendor entries programmatically.
  warnings: Incorrect VendorType values may cause undefined behavior in vendor interactions.
    Ensure that the GUID parameter corresponds to an actual NPC in the world to avoid
    runtime errors.
