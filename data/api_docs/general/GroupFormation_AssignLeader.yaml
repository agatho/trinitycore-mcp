documentation:
  brief: Assigns a new leader to the group formation.
  description: The AssignLeader method sets the specified player as the new leader
    of the group formation. This method is typically used when transitioning leadership
    within a group, such as during raid or party management. The method updates internal
    tracking of the group's leader and may trigger related events or notifications
    to other group members. It assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid
    player who is currently part of the group.
  parameters:
  - name: leaderGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will become the new
      leader of the group formation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assigning a New Leader
    code: 'GroupFormation* group = ...;

      uint32 newLeaderGuid = 12345;

      group->AssignLeader(newLeaderGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the specified player is already a
    member of the group. The implementation may internally validate that the GUID
    corresponds to an active player within the group before making any changes.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-member GUID can lead to undefined
    behavior or group state corruption. Always ensure the target player is part of
    the group before invoking this method.
