  method: GetTotalUnlockedArtifactPowers
  signature: uint32 Item::GetTotalUnlockedArtifactPowers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of unlocked artifact powers for the item.
  description: This method retrieves the number of artifact powers that have been
    unlocked for the current item. Artifact powers are special abilities or effects
    that can be unlocked through artifact progression, typically via artifact traits
    or power nodes. The method returns a uint32 value representing the total count
    of unlocked artifact powers, which is useful for determining the item's artifact
    progression status and for calculating various game mechanics such as artifact
    power consumption or unlock requirements. This method is commonly used in conjunction
    with other artifact-related functions to determine the overall artifact state
    of an item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the total count of unlocked artifact
    powers for the item. The value can be zero if no artifact powers are unlocked,
    or a positive integer if artifact powers have been unlocked through various means
    such as artifact trait points or other artifact progression mechanisms.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 unlockedPowers = item->GetTotalUnlockedArtifactPowers();\nif (unlockedPowers\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Item has unlocked artifact powers\n    // Perform actions\
      \ based on the count\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other artifact-related
    methods to determine the overall artifact progression state of an item. It may
    be affected by game mechanics such as artifact power consumption or unlock requirements,
    and should be used carefully when calculating artifact progression or determining
    item quality.
  warnings: This method does not account for any potential artifact power restrictions
    or conditions that might prevent unlocking of certain artifact powers. Care should
    be taken to ensure that the returned value accurately reflects the actual unlocked
    artifact powers in game context.
