  class: NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck
  method: operator()
  signature: bool NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck::operator()(int
    * u)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a creature entry matches the specified live state and is
    within range of the object.
  description: The operator() method serves as a predicate function for finding the
    nearest creature with a specific entry ID and live state within a given range.
    It is typically used in conjunction with container algorithms or search functions
    to locate qualifying creatures. The method checks if the provided creature entry
    meets the criteria defined by the class's internal parameters, including live
    state (alive/dead) and distance constraints. This functionality is commonly employed
    in AI behavior trees and quest-related systems where NPCs must identify nearby
    targets based on specific conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature entry matches all specified criteria (live
    state and range), otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature Search
    code: 'NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck checker(12345, true,
      50.0f);

      bool result = checker(&creatureEntry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a functor pattern used extensively in TrinityCore's
    AI and targeting systems. It operates on the assumption that the class has been
    properly initialized with valid parameters such as creature entry ID, live state
    flag, and maximum range. The method does not perform any side effects or modify
    external state.
