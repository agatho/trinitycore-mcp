  method: SetMaxTickTime
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::SetMaxTickTime(uint32 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum allowed tick time for bot performance monitoring in microseconds
  description: The SetMaxTickTime method configures the upper limit of time a bot's
    update tick can take before being flagged for performance issues. This threshold
    is used by the BotPerformanceMonitor to track and log bots that exceed acceptable
    processing times, helping identify performance bottlenecks in AI-controlled characters.
    The value is typically set based on system capabilities and desired responsiveness
    thresholds. Setting this value too low may cause legitimate bot operations to
    be marked as slow, while setting it too high may allow inefficient code to go
    unnoticed.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The maximum allowed tick time in microseconds. Valid values are positive
      integers representing time duration. Typical values range from 1000 (1ms) to
      1000000 (1 second), depending on system requirements and desired sensitivity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Performance Threshold
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.SetMaxTickTime(5000); // Set maximum tick time to 5 milliseconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring High-Performance Monitoring
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor* perfMonitor = sObjectMgr->GetBotPerformanceMonitor();\n\
      if (perfMonitor)\n{\n    perfMonitor->SetMaxTickTime(1000); // Strict 1ms limit\
      \ for high-performance systems\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the performance monitoring logic and should
    be called during initialization or configuration phases. The value is stored internally
    as a uint32 and represents the maximum allowable time for one bot tick operation
    before triggering performance warnings.
  warnings: Setting this value too low may cause false positives where legitimate
    bot operations are flagged as slow, potentially affecting gameplay experience.
    Setting it too high may mask actual performance issues in bot AI code.
