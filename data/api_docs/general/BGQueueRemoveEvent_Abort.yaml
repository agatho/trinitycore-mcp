  class: BGQueueRemoveEvent
  method: Abort
  signature: void BGQueueRemoveEvent::Abort(uint64 e_time)
documentation:
  brief: Aborts a battleground queue removal event, canceling any pending queue removal
    operations.
  description: The BGQueueRemoveEvent::Abort method is used to cancel or terminate
    an ongoing battleground queue removal event. This method is typically invoked
    when a player's queue removal process needs to be stopped prematurely, such as
    when a player rejoins the queue or when the system determines that the removal
    operation is no longer necessary. The method accepts a time parameter that likely
    represents the expected end time of the event, allowing for precise cancellation
    of timed queue operations. This functionality is crucial in maintaining proper
    queue state management and preventing stale or invalid queue entries from persisting
    in the battleground system.
  parameters:
  - name: e_time
    description: The expected end time of the queue removal event, represented as
      a uint64 timestamp. This parameter is used to identify and cancel the specific
      queue removal operation that was scheduled for this time.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Abort Usage
    code: 'BGQueueRemoveEvent* event = new BGQueueRemoveEvent();

      // ... some queue removal logic ...

      event->Abort(GetGameTime()); // Cancel the queue removal at current game time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Abort with Specific Time
    code: 'uint64 scheduled_time = sObjectMgr->GetNextQueueRemoveEventTime();

      BGQueueRemoveEvent* event = new BGQueueRemoveEvent();

      event->Abort(scheduled_time); // Cancel a specific scheduled queue removal'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground queue management system in TrinityCore.
    It's important to ensure that the e_time parameter matches the actual scheduled
    time of the event being aborted to prevent unintended behavior. The method likely
    interacts with internal queue timers and may be called from various game state
    transitions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with incorrect time values could lead to queue
    management inconsistencies or memory leaks. Always ensure that the e_time parameter
    corresponds to a valid, scheduled queue removal event before calling Abort.
