documentation:
  brief: Updates war mode reward values for all active players in the world.
  description: The UpdateWarModeRewardValues method recalculates and applies updated
    war mode rewards across all online players in the game world. This method is typically
    invoked when war mode settings or reward multipliers are modified, ensuring that
    all connected players receive the correct bonus values for their war mode activities.
    The function iterates through all active sessions and updates their respective
    war mode reward data, which may include experience gains, honor points, or other
    in-game benefits tied to war mode status. This operation is performed synchronously
    and affects all players currently logged into the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Triggering War Mode Reward Update
    code: World::instance()->UpdateWarModeRewardValues();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when war mode settings have been modified
    to ensure all players receive updated rewards. It performs a full iteration of
    active sessions, so frequent calls may impact performance during high player activity
    periods.
  warnings: Calling this method while players are actively engaged in war mode content
    may cause temporary inconsistencies in reward calculations until the update is
    fully processed. Avoid calling this method during critical gameplay moments to
    prevent potential client-side synchronization issues.
