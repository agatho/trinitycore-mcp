  method: UpdateBotTracking
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::UpdateBotTracking(Player * bot, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the objective tracking state for a bot player.
  description: The UpdateBotTracking method is responsible for managing and updating
    the tracking of objectives assigned to a bot player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method typically handles the synchronization of quest progress, objective
    completion states, and related tracking data for non-player characters (bots)
    in the game world. It processes the time-based updates required for maintaining
    accurate tracking information and ensures that the bot's objective state remains
    consistent with the game's progression systems. The method operates on a per-diff
    basis, meaning it updates based on elapsed game time or tick intervals.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose objectives
      need to be tracked and updated. This parameter must not be null and should point
      to a valid bot instance within the game world.
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference (in milliseconds) since the last update call.
      This value is used to determine how much time has passed for objective tracking
      calculations and updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic bot tracking update
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // One second elapsed

      currentObjectiveTracker->UpdateBotTracking(myBot, deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic bot tracking in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    for (auto& bot : botList)\n    {\n        uint32\
      \ diff = sWorld->GetLastTickTime();\n        objectiveTracker->UpdateBotTracking(bot,\
      \ diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the game's main update loop or
    tick handler. It may perform internal checks to ensure that the bot player is
    valid and actively tracked before proceeding with updates. The implementation
    likely involves iterating through active objectives assigned to the bot and updating
    their completion status based on elapsed time or other conditions.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is valid and represents an
    actual bot before calling this method. The 'diff' value should represent accurate
    time deltas to maintain proper tracking behavior.
