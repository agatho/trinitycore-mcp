  signature: void InstanceCoordination::UpdateNavigationRoute(Group * group, const
    int & currentLocation)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the navigation route for a group within an instance coordination
    system based on their current location.
  description: The UpdateNavigationRoute method is responsible for recalculating and
    updating the movement path or navigation route for a specified group within the
    instance coordination framework. This method ensures that group members maintain
    proper positioning and follow designated paths during instance encounters, particularly
    in scenarios involving complex dungeon layouts or dynamic environment changes.
    It takes into account the group's current location to determine the appropriate
    next waypoints or destinations. The method is typically invoked when a group member
    reaches a specific navigation point or when environmental conditions change that
    require route adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group whose navigation
      route needs to be updated. Must not be null and should represent an active group
      within the instance.
  - name: currentLocation
    description: Reference to an integer value indicating the current location identifier
      or index within the instance's navigation system. This determines which part
      of the route is being processed and what next steps should be taken.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectAccessor->GetGroupByLeader(playerGuid);\nif (myGroup)\n\
      {\n    int currentLoc = 5;\n    instanceCoordination->UpdateNavigationRoute(myGroup,\
      \ currentLoc);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Location Update
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterInstance(Player* player, uint32 instanceId)\n{\n    Group*\
      \ group = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->isInInstance())\n   \
      \ {\n        int currentLocation = GetInstanceNavigationPoint(player);\n   \
      \     instanceCoordination->UpdateNavigationRoute(group, currentLocation);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the instance coordination system and should only be
    called when group members are within an active instance. The method assumes that
    the group has already been properly initialized within the instance framework.
    Performance considerations include avoiding frequent calls during rapid location
    changes, as this could lead to unnecessary route recalculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing invalid or uninitialized currentLocation values may result in
    undefined behavior or incorrect navigation paths. This method should not be called
    outside of instance contexts where group coordination is active.
