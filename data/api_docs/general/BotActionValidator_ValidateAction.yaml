  signature: bool BotActionValidator::ValidateAction(const BotActionExtended & action)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a bot action is acceptable based on current game state
    and rules
  description: The ValidateAction method checks if a given bot action is valid according
    to the current game context and predefined rules. It evaluates various conditions
    such as player state, action type, target validity, and game mechanics constraints
    to determine if the action can be safely executed. This method is crucial for
    maintaining game integrity and preventing invalid bot behaviors that could disrupt
    gameplay or exploit system vulnerabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: The BotActionExtended object containing the action details to validate,
      including action type, target information, and associated parameters
  returns: Returns true if the bot action is valid and can be executed, false otherwise.
    Invalid actions may include those targeting invalid targets, using forbidden action
    types, or violating game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation of a bot movement action
    code: "BotActionExtended action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_MOVE;\naction.targetPosition\
      \ = Position(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);\nbool isValid = validator.ValidateAction(action);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with executing the movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating a complex bot combat action
    code: "BotActionExtended action;\naction.type = BOT_ACTION_ATTACK;\naction.targetGuid\
      \ = PlayerGUID;\naction.abilityId = 12345;\nbool isValid = validator.ValidateAction(action);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Execute the attack action\n    bot->ExecuteAction(action);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid action, perhaps log or select alternative\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Invalid combat action detected for bot {}\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs comprehensive validation including checking player state,
    target validity, resource availability, and game rule compliance. The validation
    process may involve multiple internal checks and could potentially be computationally
    expensive depending on the action complexity. It's recommended to cache results
    when performing repeated validations for the same action type.
  warnings: The method assumes that the BotActionExtended parameter contains valid
    data structures. Passing malformed or uninitialized action objects may lead to
    undefined behavior. Additionally, this validation does not guarantee that the
    action will succeed in execution - it only ensures that the action is structurally
    and contextually valid.
