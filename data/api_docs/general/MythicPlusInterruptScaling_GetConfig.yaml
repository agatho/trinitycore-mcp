  class: MythicPlusInterruptScaling
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const MythicPlusConfig * MythicPlusInterruptScaling::GetConfig(uint8
    level)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the Mythic+ configuration data for a specified level.
  description: The GetConfig method retrieves the MythicPlusConfig structure associated
    with a given level. This configuration contains settings and scaling factors that
    define how Mythic+ dungeons behave at different levels, including enemy stats,
    item drops, and reward calculations. The method is typically used during dungeon
    generation or progression to ensure proper scaling of content based on player
    level. It accesses an internal lookup table or database of configurations indexed
    by level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const MythicPlusConfig structure that holds the configuration
    data for the specified level. Returns nullptr if no configuration exists for the
    given level.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Mythic+ config for level 10
    code: "const MythicPlusConfig* config = instance->GetConfig(10);\nif (config !=\
      \ nullptr)\n{\n    // Use config data\n    uint32 rewardItemLevel = config->RewardItemLevel;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using a lookup table or map structure for
    efficient access. The returned pointer should not be modified as it points to
    const data. Ensure the level parameter is within valid range (typically 1-20)
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid level may return nullptr, which must
    be checked before dereferencing. Do not assume all levels have configurations
    defined; always validate the returned pointer.
