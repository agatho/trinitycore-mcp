  class: HavocDemonHunterRefactored
  method: ExecuteSingleTargetRotation
  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Havoc Demon Hunter's single-target rotation logic for the specified
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core combat logic
    for a Havoc Demon Hunter when engaging a single enemy target. This method evaluates
    the current state of the player, including available abilities, resource levels
    (such as Fury and Soul Fragments), and target conditions to determine the optimal
    sequence of actions. It integrates with the TrinityCore AI system to ensure proper
    spell casting, ability usage, and cooldown management during single-target encounters.
    The method assumes that a valid target has been previously set and that the player
    is in combat mode.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier (GUID).
      This parameter specifies which enemy unit the rotation should be executed against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyHavocAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n \
      \   {\n        int targetGuid = me->GetVictim()->GetGUID();\n        ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Rotation Logic
    code: "void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(int* target)\n\
      {\n    if (!target || *target <= 0) return;\n\n    Unit* targetUnit = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*me,\
      \ *target);\n    if (!targetUnit || !targetUnit->IsAlive()) return;\n\n    //\
      \ Core rotation logic would be implemented here\n    // e.g., check for available\
      \ abilities, manage fury, etc.\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within an AI update loop or combat state
    handler. It relies on the TrinityCore framework's internal targeting and combat
    systems to ensure that the target remains valid throughout execution. Developers
    should ensure that the target parameter points to a valid, alive unit before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target pointer may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the target exists and is alive before invoking
    this method. Additionally, be cautious about thread safety if this method is called
    from multiple contexts simultaneously.
