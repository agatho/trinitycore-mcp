  signature: void HolyPriestRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the holy priest's buffs and auras based on current game state and
    spell effects.
  description: 'The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing
    all active buffs and auras on the Holy Priest character. This includes checking
    for expired buffs, applying new buff effects, and ensuring that the priest''s
    aura state remains consistent with the current game mechanics. The method typically
    runs during each AI update cycle to maintain proper buff management, particularly
    for healing-oriented abilities such as Power Word: Shield, Prayer of Mending,
    and other beneficial auras. It ensures that the priest maintains optimal healing
    capabilities by keeping relevant buffs active and properly timed.'

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void HolyPriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_priest->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required for buff state synchronization.
    The implementation may involve checking spell cooldowns, aura durations, and player
    status conditions to determine which buffs need updating or refreshing.
