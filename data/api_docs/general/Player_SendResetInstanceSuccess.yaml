  class: Player
  method: SendResetInstanceSuccess
  signature: void Player::SendResetInstanceSuccess(uint32 MapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a reset instance success message to the player's client for the specified
    map.
  description: This method sends a notification to the player's client indicating
    that a dungeon or raid instance has been successfully reset. It is typically used
    when a player completes a reset operation, such as when they are removed from
    a dungeon or when a group member leaves the instance. The method ensures that
    the player receives proper feedback about their instance status and allows them
    to re-enter the instance without issues. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    game balance and preventing players from being stuck in invalid states.
  parameters:
  - name: MapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map that was reset. This corresponds
      to the MapID field in the game database, which identifies a specific instance
      or dungeon.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SendResetInstanceSuccess(123);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 mapId = 456;

      player->SendResetInstanceSuccess(mapId);

      // This would be called after a successful reset operation in a dungeon'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's communication system and should
    only be called when a player has actually completed a reset operation. It is typically
    used in conjunction with other instance-related methods to ensure proper synchronization
    between server and client.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause client-side confusion or incorrect
    instance state handling, potentially leading to players being unable to enter
    or exit instances correctly.
