  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether NPC interaction functionality is currently enabled in the
    manager.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the NPCInteractionManager has been
    activated and is capable of processing NPC interaction events. This flag typically
    controls whether the system should respond to player interactions with NPCs, such
    as dialog triggers or quest acceptances. The method performs a simple boolean
    check on an internal state variable that can be modified through other manager
    methods or configuration settings. It does not perform any complex logic or external
    calls, making it a lightweight operation for frequent checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if NPC interaction is enabled and the manager is active; returns
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that either the system
    has been explicitly disabled or that initialization has not yet occurred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Proceed with NPC interaction\
      \ logic\n    player->SendNPCDialogMessage(...);\n} else {\n    // Handle disabled\
      \ interaction case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"NPC interactions are currently\
      \ disabled.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Interaction Enablement
    code: "void ToggleNPCInteractions(bool enable) {\n    if (enable && !npcInteractionManager.IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n        // Enable interaction system\n        npcInteractionManager.Enable();\n\
      \        LOG_INFO(\"npc\", \"NPC interactions enabled.\");\n    } else if (!enable\
      \ && npcInteractionManager.IsEnabled()) {\n        // Disable interaction system\n\
      \        npcInteractionManager.Disable();\n        LOG_INFO(\"npc\", \"NPC interactions\
      \ disabled.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with Enable() and Disable()
    methods to control the overall state of NPC interaction handling. It's recommended
    to cache the result of this method if it's checked frequently within a single
    operation to avoid repeated boolean evaluations.
