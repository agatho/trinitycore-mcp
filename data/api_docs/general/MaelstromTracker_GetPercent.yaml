  class: MaelstromTracker
  method: GetPercent
  signature: uint32 MaelstromTracker::GetPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the percentage of maelstrom energy accumulated by
    the player.
  description: The GetPercent method computes the current percentage of maelstrom
    energy relative to the maximum possible value. This is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's elemental shaman gameplay mechanics, particularly for abilities
    like Lava Burst or Maelstrom Weapon. The returned value represents how much of
    the maelstrom resource has been built up, typically ranging from 0 to 100 percent.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call repeatedly during
    gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the percentage of maelstrom energy accumulated,
    where 0 indicates no energy and 100 indicates full energy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Shaman Ability Logic
    code: "uint32 percent = tracker->GetPercent();\nif (percent >= 100)\n{\n    //\
      \ Trigger Maelstrom Weapon proc or similar effect\n    player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_MAELOSTRUM_PROC, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Displaying Maelstrom Status to Player
    code: 'uint32 percent = tracker->GetPercent();

      ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage("Maelstrom: %u%%", percent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with MaelstromTracker::AddMaelstrom()
    and MaelstromTracker::Reset() to manage the energy buildup. The percentage calculation
    assumes a linear relationship between accumulated maelstrom points and the final
    percentage, which may vary depending on specific game mechanics or class-specific
    modifiers.
