  class: WorldSession
  method: SendSetPlayerDeclinedNamesResult
  signature: void WorldSession::SendSetPlayerDeclinedNamesResult(DeclinedNameResult
    result, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a response to the client indicating the result of a declined names
    update request.
  description: The SendSetPlayerDeclinedNamesResult method is used by the WorldSession
    class to communicate the outcome of a player's attempt to set or update their
    declined names. This method sends a specific packet to the connected client, informing
    them whether the operation was successful or if an error occurred. It is typically
    invoked after processing a request from the client to modify declined name data
    for a character. The result parameter indicates the status of the operation, while
    the GUID identifies which player's declined names were affected. This method plays
    a role in maintaining character customization data within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The DeclinedNameResult enum value indicating the outcome of the declined
      names update operation. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_NAME,
      etc., depending on the implementation.
  - name: guid
    description: The integer representation of the player's unique identifier (GUID)
      for whom the declined names update was attempted. This identifies the specific
      character whose data is being modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send successful declined names result
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      DeclinedNameResult result = DECLINED_NAME_SUCCESS;

      int guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      session->SendSetPlayerDeclinedNamesResult(result, guid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send failed declined names result
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      DeclinedNameResult result = DECLINED_NAME_ERROR;

      int guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      session->SendSetPlayerDeclinedNamesResult(result, guid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's packet system and should
    only be called when a declined names update operation has been completed. The
    GUID parameter must correspond to an active player character in the session's
    context. Ensure that the result value accurately reflects the outcome of the underlying
    database or processing logic.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to client-side errors or inconsistent
    state between server and client. Always validate the GUID before sending the response,
    as invalid GUIDs may cause connection issues or unexpected behavior in the client.
