  class: LootCoordination
  method: PreloadGroupPreferences
  signature: void LootCoordination::PreloadGroupPreferences(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Preloads group loot preferences for all members of a specified group.
  description: The PreloadGroupPreferences method initializes and caches loot preference
    data for all players within the given group. This ensures that loot coordination
    can proceed efficiently without requiring repeated database lookups or recalculations
    during loot distribution events. The method typically runs when a group is formed
    or when loot coordination is about to begin, preloading necessary information
    such as individual player loot settings, item priorities, and group loot rules.
    It prepares the internal data structures needed for the LootCoordination system
    to make informed decisions during loot assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members whose loot preferences
      need to be preloaded. Must not be null and must represent a valid group with
      active members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Preload loot preferences for a group
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n\
      \    LootCoordination::PreloadGroupPreferences(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group creation or before loot distribution
    begins to avoid performance penalties during critical loot coordination moments.
    It may internally query the database for player-specific loot settings and cache
    them in memory for fast access.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Group pointer is valid and contains active members;
    otherwise, the method might not behave as expected or could cause undefined behavior.
