  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: LoadWeights
  signature: void NeuralNetwork::LoadWeights(const std::string & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Loads neural network weights from a specified file.
  description: The LoadWeights method initializes the neural network's weight parameters
    by reading them from a persistent storage file. This method is typically used
    during system startup or when restoring trained model states in AI-driven game
    systems. The loaded weights determine how the neural network processes inputs
    and makes decisions. It is expected that the file format matches the internal
    serialization structure of the neural network implementation. This operation may
    involve file I/O and could potentially block execution until the load completes.
  parameters:
  - name: filename
    description: Path to the file containing serialized neural network weights. The
      file must be accessible and contain valid weight data in a format compatible
      with the current neural network implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LoadWeights
    code: 'NeuralNetwork nn;

      nn.LoadWeights("data/neural_network_weights.dat");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the specified file exists and is readable. It does
    not perform validation on the loaded data beyond basic deserialization. If the
    file format is incorrect or corrupted, behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Do not call this method while the neural network is actively processing
    inputs, as it may cause race conditions or inconsistent states. Ensure that the
    weight file is generated using the same version of the neural network architecture
    to avoid compatibility issues.
