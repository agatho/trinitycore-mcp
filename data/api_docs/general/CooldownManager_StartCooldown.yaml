  class: CooldownManager
  method: StartCooldown
  signature: void CooldownManager::StartCooldown(uint32 spellId, uint32 cooldownMs,
    bool triggersGCD)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a cooldown period for a specified spell, optionally triggering
    the Global Cooldown.
  description: The StartCooldown method is used to begin a cooldown period for a given
    spell ID. This method allows developers to programmatically enforce cooldowns
    on spells, which is essential for game balance and proper spell usage mechanics.
    When triggersGCD is set to true, the cooldown will also trigger the Global Cooldown
    (GCD), preventing other actions from being performed for a short duration. The
    cooldown duration is specified in milliseconds. This method is typically used
    within spell effect handlers or custom AI logic to manage spell availability and
    prevent spamming of abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that is being placed on cooldown.
      This ID must correspond to a valid spell in the game's database.
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The duration of the cooldown in milliseconds. This value determines
      how long the spell will be unavailable after being used.
  - name: triggersGCD
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the cooldown should also trigger
      the Global Cooldown (GCD). If true, the GCD will be activated for the duration
      of the cooldown.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cooldown
    code: cooldownManager->StartCooldown(12345, 3000, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Cooldown with GCD Trigger
    code: cooldownManager->StartCooldown(67890, 5000, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the player's or creature's ability to cast spells.
    It should be used carefully to ensure proper game balance and prevent exploits.
    The cooldown is typically managed internally by the CooldownManager class and
    may interact with other systems like spell queues or action bar updates.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the cooldown duration can lead to gameplay imbalance
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that spellId corresponds to a valid spell entry
    in the database, otherwise the method might not behave as expected. Using this
    method outside of appropriate contexts (e.g., during spell casting) may cause
    synchronization issues.
