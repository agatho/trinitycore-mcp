documentation:
  brief: Removes a spell from the charm's action bar
  description: The RemoveSpellFromActionBar method removes a specified spell from
    the action bar of a charm (such as a pet or minion) controlled by a player. This
    method is typically used when a charm's spell list changes, such as when a pet
    learns or unlearns spells, or when certain game events occur that modify the available
    spells. The method checks if the spell exists on the action bar and removes it
    if found, returning true upon successful removal or false if the spell was not
    present.
  parameters:
  - name: spell_id
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be removed from the action
      bar. This should correspond to a valid Spell ID used in the World of Warcraft
      game mechanics.
  returns: Returns true if the spell was successfully removed from the action bar,
    or false if the spell was not found on the action bar.
  examples:
  - title: Remove a spell from a pet's action bar
    code: "if (player->GetPet()->GetCharmInfo()->RemoveSpellFromActionBar(12345))\
      \ {\n    // Spell successfully removed\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell 12345 removed\
      \ from pet's action bar\");\n} else {\n    // Spell not found on action bar\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Spell 12345 not found on pet's action bar\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the charm's action bar data structure and is typically
    called during spell learning/unlearning events. It does not directly affect the
    spell's availability in the character's spellbook, but only its presence on the
    action bar.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell_id parameter corresponds to a valid spell that has
    been previously added to the charm's action bar. Calling this method with an invalid
    or non-existent spell ID may result in no-op behavior and could lead to unexpected
    UI states if not handled properly.
