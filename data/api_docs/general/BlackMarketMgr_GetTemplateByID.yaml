documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a black market template by its unique identifier.
  description: The GetTemplateByID method fetches a BlackMarketTemplate object from
    the internal collection using the specified market ID. This function is used to
    access specific black market auction templates that define the properties and
    behavior of items available in the black market system. The method performs a
    lookup operation within the manager's data structure, returning a pointer to the
    template if found, or nullptr if no matching template exists for the given ID.
    This allows other systems to retrieve and utilize black market item configurations
    without direct access to the underlying data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the BlackMarketTemplate object corresponding to the
    provided marketId. Returns nullptr if no template with the specified ID exists
    in the manager's collection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const BlackMarketTemplate* template = blackMarketMgr->GetTemplateByID(12345);\n\
      if (template)\n{\n    // Use the template to access black market item properties\n\
      \    uint32 itemId = template->ItemId;\n    uint32 bidAmount = template->MinBid;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may involve iterating through
    internal containers. For optimal performance, it's recommended to cache the returned
    pointer if the same template is accessed multiple times. The returned pointer
    remains valid as long as the BlackMarketMgr instance exists and the template hasn't
    been removed from its collection.
  warnings: The returned pointer should never be modified directly as it points to
    const data. Accessing a template with an invalid marketId will return nullptr,
    so always check for null before using the returned value to prevent segmentation
    faults.
