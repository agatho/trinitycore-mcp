documentation:
  brief: Compares two RespawnInfo pointers for ordering in a sorted container.
  description: The operator() method implements a comparison function object (functor)
    used to sort RespawnInfo pointers. It is typically used with STL containers like
    std::set or std::map that require a strict weak ordering predicate. The comparison
    logic likely evaluates the respawn times or identifiers of the RespawnInfo objects
    to determine their relative ordering. This allows for efficient retrieval and
    management of respawn information in sorted collections, which is common in TrinityCore's
    creature and game object respawn systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the first RespawnInfo pointer (a) should come before the
    second RespawnInfo pointer (b) in the sorted order; otherwise returns false. The
    ordering is determined by comparing internal properties of the RespawnInfo objects,
    such as respawn time or GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Using CompareRespawnInfo with std::set
    code: 'std::set<RespawnInfo*, CompareRespawnInfo> respawnSet;

      // Inserting RespawnInfo pointers into the set

      respawnSet.insert(respawnInfo1);

      respawnSet.insert(respawnInfo2);

      // The set will automatically order elements using CompareRespawnInfo::operator()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a const member function and does not modify the state of the
    CompareRespawnInfo object. It should be used with caution when dealing with dynamic
    RespawnInfo objects whose properties might change after insertion into a sorted
    container, as this could invalidate the ordering.
