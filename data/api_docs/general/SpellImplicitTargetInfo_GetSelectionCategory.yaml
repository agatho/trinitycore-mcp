documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the selection category for a spell implicit target.
  description: The GetSelectionCategory method returns the SpellTargetSelectionCategories
    enumeration value that defines how targets are selected for a given spell implicit
    target. This categorization is used internally by the TrinityCore spell system
    to determine target validation rules, selection logic, and targeting behavior
    during spell execution. The returned category helps identify whether the target
    selection follows standard rules, is restricted to specific types, or requires
    special handling based on game mechanics such as area of effect, single target,
    or group-based targeting.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellTargetSelectionCategories enumeration value indicating the target
    selection category for this implicit target. Possible values include categories
    like TARGET_SELECTION_CATEGORY_SINGLE, TARGET_SELECTION_CATEGORY_AREA, TARGET_SELECTION_CATEGORY_GROUP,
    etc., which define how targets are chosen and validated during spell casting.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Selection Category for a Spell Target
    code: "SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo;\n// Assume targetInfo has been initialized\
      \ with valid data\nSpellTargetSelectionCategories category = targetInfo.GetSelectionCategory();\n\
      if (category == TARGET_SELECTION_CATEGORY_SINGLE)\n{\n    // Handle single target\
      \ selection logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within spell processing code to determine how
    targets should be selected and validated. It's important to note that the returned
    category may influence target filtering, validation rules, and the overall targeting
    behavior of spells in TrinityCore.
