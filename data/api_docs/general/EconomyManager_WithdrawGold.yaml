  brief: Withdraws the specified amount of gold from the player's economy account
  description: The WithdrawGold method attempts to remove a specified amount of gold
    from the player's account balance. It performs validation to ensure the requested
    amount is positive and that the player has sufficient funds. The method returns
    true if the withdrawal is successful, or false if the operation fails due to insufficient
    funds or invalid parameters. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    other economy management functions to handle transactions within the game's monetary
    system.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of gold to withdraw from the player's account. Must be
      a positive value greater than zero.
  returns: Returns true if the gold withdrawal was successful, false otherwise. The
    method will return false if the requested amount exceeds the player's current
    balance or if the amount is invalid (zero or negative).

    code: "if (economyManager.WithdrawGold(1000)) {\n    // Successfully withdrew\
      \ 1000 gold\n    printf(\"Withdrawal successful\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to withdraw gold\n    printf(\"Insufficient funds or invalid amount\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gold Withdrawal
    code: "uint64 requestedGold = 5000;\nif (player->GetMoney() >= requestedGold &&\
      \ economyManager.WithdrawGold(requestedGold)) {\n    player->ModifyMoney(-requestedGold);\
      \ // Update player's money\n    printf(\"Successfully withdrew %llu gold\\n\"\
      , requestedGold);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to withdraw %llu gold\\n\"\
      , requestedGold);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EconomyManager class which handles all financial
    transactions for players. The implementation should be thread-safe as it may be
    called from different game systems simultaneously. It's recommended to check player
    balance before calling this method to avoid unnecessary operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with zero or negative values will result in a failed
    withdrawal and return false. Always validate the amount parameter before calling
    this function to prevent unexpected behavior. This method does not automatically
    update the player's UI or send notifications about the transaction.
