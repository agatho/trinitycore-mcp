  class: PvPCombatAI
  method: GetRogueOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetRogueOffensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of offensive rogue cooldowns currently active on the
    player.
  description: The GetRogueOffensiveCooldowns method is used to determine how many
    offensive abilities a rogue player has on cooldown. This information is typically
    used by AI systems to make decisions about when to use specific abilities, such
    as finishing moves or utility skills. The method returns an integer representing
    the count of active offensive cooldowns for the rogue class. It's important to
    note that this method may be part of a larger PvP combat AI system within TrinityCore
    and is likely intended for internal AI decision-making rather than direct player
    interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object for which cooldown information is being
      retrieved. This parameter must point to a valid Player instance, otherwise behavior
      is undefined.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of offensive rogue cooldowns
    currently active on the specified player. A return value of 0 indicates no offensive
    cooldowns are active, while higher values indicate increasing numbers of active
    cooldowns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* roguePlayer = ...; // Assume this points to a valid rogue player\n\
      int cooldownCount = ai->GetRogueOffensiveCooldowns(roguePlayer);\nif (cooldownCount\
      \ == 0) {\n    // All offensive abilities are available\n    // Execute an offensive\
      \ ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making
    code: "class MyPvPAI : public PvPCombatAI {\npublic:\n    void Update() override\
      \ {\n        Player* player = GetPlayer();\n        int cooldowns = GetRogueOffensiveCooldowns(player);\n\
      \        \n        if (cooldowns < 2) {\n            // Use an offensive ability\n\
      \            CastOffensiveAbility();\n        } else {\n            // Wait\
      \ for cooldowns to expire\n            DoNothing();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system designed for PvP combat
    scenarios in TrinityCore. The implementation details are not visible but it's
    expected to interact with the player's spell and ability cooldown tracking systems.
    This method may be used in conjunction with other AI decision-making methods to
    determine optimal action timing.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must be a valid pointer to a Player object, or
    undefined behavior will occur. The method assumes that the player is a rogue class;
    calling this on non-rogue players may produce unexpected results or undefined
    behavior.
