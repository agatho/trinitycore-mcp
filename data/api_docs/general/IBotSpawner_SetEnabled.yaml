  class: IBotSpawner
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void IBotSpawner::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot spawner functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the bot spawner is active or
    inactive. When enabled, the spawner will create and manage AI bots according to
    configured parameters. When disabled, no new bots will be spawned and existing
    bots will not be managed by this spawner instance. This method is typically used
    to dynamically control bot spawning behavior during runtime, such as when transitioning
    between different game states or during maintenance periods.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the bot spawner should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable bot spawner
    code: botSpawner->SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable bot spawner during maintenance
    code: botSpawner->SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spawner controls
    to manage AI bot lifecycle. The change takes effect immediately, but existing
    bots will continue running until explicitly managed or removed.
