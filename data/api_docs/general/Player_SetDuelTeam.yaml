  class: Player
  method: SetDuelTeam
  signature: void Player::SetDuelTeam(uint32 duelTeam)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the duel team for the player, determining which team they belong to
    during duels.
  description: This method assigns a specific duel team ID to the player, which controls
    their participation in duels and affects their team-based gameplay mechanics.
    The duel team is used to determine whether the player is on the same team or opposing
    team during duel battles. This method is typically called internally by the game
    system when players enter duel state, and it ensures that both players involved
    in a duel are correctly assigned to their respective teams. It does not directly
    affect the player's actual team assignment in the game world, but rather controls
    the duel-specific team configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: duelTeam
    description: The duel team ID to assign to the player. Valid values are 0 (neutral),
      1 (player team), or 2 (opponent team). This parameter determines which team
      the player will be placed in during a duel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetDuelTeam(1); // Assign player to team 1 (player''s own team)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 teamId = 2;

      player->SetDuelTeam(teamId); // Assign player to team 2 (opponent team)

      // This is typically used when setting up a duel between two players

      // where one player is assigned to the opposing team'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal duel system mechanics and is called automatically
    during duel setup. It should only be used when preparing for a duel or when setting
    up duel participants. The method does not affect the player's regular team assignment
    in the game world, but rather controls their duel-specific team configuration.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of duel contexts as it may cause
    unexpected behavior during normal gameplay. It is typically used internally by
    the game system and should only be used when setting up duel participants.
