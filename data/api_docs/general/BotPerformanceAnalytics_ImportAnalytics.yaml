  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: ImportAnalytics
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::ImportAnalytics(const std::string & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Imports performance analytics data from a specified file into the BotPerformanceAnalytics
    system.
  description: The ImportAnalytics method reads performance metrics and statistics
    from a given file and loads them into the BotPerformanceAnalytics class for further
    processing or analysis. This functionality is typically used to load historical
    data, configuration settings, or benchmark results that were previously exported
    or generated by the system. The method assumes the input file is in a recognized
    format and contains valid performance data structures. It does not validate the
    integrity of the data beyond basic parsing, so malformed inputs may lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors during processing.
  parameters:
  - name: filename
    description: The path to the file containing performance analytics data to be
      imported. The file must exist and be readable by the application process. It
      should contain structured data in a format recognized by the BotPerformanceAnalytics
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Import Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.ImportAnalytics("bot_performance_data.json");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Import with Error Handling
    code: "try {\n    BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\n    analytics.ImportAnalytics(\"\
      /var/lib/wow/bot_stats.dat\");\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"Failed to import analytics: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method performs no thread synchronization, so concurrent access from
    multiple threads should be avoided. It is recommended to ensure that the file
    path provided is absolute or relative to the working directory of the application
    process. If the file format is not recognized or contains invalid data, behavior
    may be undefined.
  warnings: This method does not perform any validation on the contents of the input
    file. Malformed or corrupted files can cause runtime exceptions or unexpected
    behavior. Always verify that the input file is properly formatted before calling
    this method.
