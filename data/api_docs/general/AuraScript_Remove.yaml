  method: Remove
  signature: void AuraScript::Remove(int removeMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the aura from the target with the specified removal mode.
  description: The Remove method in AuraScript is used to remove an aura from its
    target. It takes a single integer parameter that defines how the aura should be
    removed, which corresponds to different removal modes such as normal removal,
    dispel, or duration expiration. This method is typically called internally by
    the TrinityCore framework during aura lifecycle events but can also be invoked
    manually within custom aura scripts. The removeMode parameter determines the context
    and behavior of the removal, affecting how the aura's OnRemove hook is executed
    and whether any related effects like cooldowns or visual updates occur.
  parameters:
  - name: removeMode
    description: Defines the mode of aura removal. Common values include AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT
      (0), AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL (1), AURA_REMOVE_BY_ENEMY_SPELL (2), and AURA_REMOVE_BY_EXPIRE
      (3). This affects how the aura's removal is processed and what events are triggered.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnRemove(AuraEffect\
      \ const* aurEff, AuraRemoveMode removeMode) override\n    {\n        // Remove\
      \ the aura immediately with default removal mode\n        Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Aura Removal
    code: "class HealingAuraScript : public AuraScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnRemove(AuraEffect\
      \ const* aurEff, AuraRemoveMode removeMode) override\n    {\n        if (removeMode\
      \ == AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL)\n        {\n            // Handle special behavior\
      \ when aura is dispelled\n            Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DISPEL);\n     \
      \   }\n        else\n        {\n            // Normal removal\n            Remove(AURA_REMOVE_BY_DEFAULT);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method should only be called from within an AuraScript's OnRemove hook
    or similar lifecycle methods. Calling it outside of these contexts may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. The removeMode parameter is crucial for proper
    aura handling and affects how the system processes removal events, including triggering
    appropriate callbacks and updating visual states.
  warnings: Never call Remove() directly from outside of an AuraScript's lifecycle
    methods unless you are certain about the context and consequences. Improper usage
    can cause memory corruption or unexpected behavior in aura management. Also note
    that calling Remove() multiple times on the same aura instance may result in undefined
    behavior.
