  class: BotProfiler
  method: GenerateSessionId
  signature: uint64_t BotProfiler::GenerateSessionId()
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique session identifier for bot profiling sessions.
  description: The GenerateSessionId method creates and returns a unique 64-bit identifier
    that is used to track and correlate profiling data for bot activities within the
    TrinityCore framework. This identifier is typically used to associate various
    performance metrics, behavior logs, and other diagnostic information with a specific
    session of bot operations. The generated ID ensures that each profiling session
    can be uniquely identified and analyzed independently, which is crucial for debugging
    and optimizing bot behavior in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the unique session identifier for the current
    bot profiling session. This identifier is guaranteed to be unique within the context
    of the running TrinityCore instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint64_t sessionId = BotProfiler::GenerateSessionId();

      // Use sessionId to track bot profiling data

      TC_LOG_INFO("bot", "Starting bot profiling session with ID: %llu", sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The implementation likely uses a combination of timestamp-based generation
    and potentially a counter or hash to ensure uniqueness. This method is expected
    to be thread-safe as it's part of the core profiling infrastructure.
