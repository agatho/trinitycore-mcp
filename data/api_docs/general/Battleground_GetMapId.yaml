  class: Battleground
  method: GetMapId
  signature: int Battleground::GetMapId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the map identifier associated with the battleground instance.
  description: The GetMapId method retrieves the unique map identifier that corresponds
    to the battleground instance. This identifier is used internally by TrinityCore
    to distinguish between different battleground maps and their respective game mechanics,
    such as objectives, spawn points, and victory conditions. The returned value typically
    matches the MapID defined in the game's database for the specific battleground
    type. This method is commonly used during battleground initialization, player
    assignment, and event handling to ensure proper map context is maintained throughout
    the match.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the map identifier of the battleground instance.
    This value corresponds to the MapID field in the game's database and uniquely
    identifies the specific battleground map being referenced.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      int mapId = bg->GetMapId();

      printf("Battleground map ID: %d\n", mapId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Map Type
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundForPlayer(player);\n\
      if (bg)\n{\n    int mapId = bg->GetMapId();\n    if (mapId == 566) // Alterac\
      \ Valley\n    {\n        // Handle Alterac Valley specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that returns a cached value stored during
    battleground initialization. It does not perform any calculations or database
    lookups, making it efficient for frequent calls. The returned map ID directly
    corresponds to the MapID field in the dbc files and the database tables related
    to battlegrounds.
