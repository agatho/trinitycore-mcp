  class: IdleMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void IdleMovementGenerator::Initialize(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the idle movement generator with provided parameters.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the IdleMovementGenerator with specified
    configuration parameters. This method is typically called during the creation
    or activation of an AI movement behavior for a creature or unit. It configures
    internal state variables that control how the unit will behave during idle periods,
    such as idle movement patterns, duration, or animation states. The method prepares
    the generator to begin generating idle movement paths when invoked by the AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that configures the idle movement
      behavior. This parameter may control idle duration, movement radius, or other
      behavioral aspects of the idle state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Idle Movement Generator
    code: 'IdleMovementGenerator generator;

      int idleDuration = 5000; // 5 seconds

      generator.Initialize(&idleDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a movement generator. Re-initializing may cause undefined behavior or memory leaks
    if not handled properly by the implementation. The parameter passed must be a
    valid integer pointer, otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method will likely result in a crash or
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the integer pointed to by param0 has a valid value
    before calling Initialize.
