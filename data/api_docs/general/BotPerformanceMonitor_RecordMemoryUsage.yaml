  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordMemoryUsage
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordMemoryUsage(uint32_t botGuid, uint64_t
    bytes, const std::string & context)
documentation:
  brief: Records memory usage statistics for a specific bot with associated context
    information.
  description: The RecordMemoryUsage method logs memory consumption data for a given
    bot identified by its GUID. This function is typically used in performance monitoring
    systems to track how much memory each bot instance is consuming at various points
    during gameplay or simulation. The recorded data includes the amount of memory
    in bytes and an optional context string that provides additional information about
    when or why the measurement was taken. This method helps developers identify memory
    leaks, optimize resource usage, and maintain stable performance across multiple
    bot instances within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which memory usage is being
      recorded. Must be a valid bot GUID within the current session.
  - name: bytes
    description: Amount of memory consumed by the bot, measured in bytes. Should represent
      a non-negative integer value indicating current memory allocation.
  - name: context
    description: Descriptive string providing context about when or why the memory
      measurement was taken. Can be used to categorize measurements such as 'initial_load',
      'combat_state', or 'idle_period'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Recording
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      uint64_t memoryBytes = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB

      monitor.RecordMemoryUsage(botGuid, memoryBytes, "combat_start");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Memory During Bot Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBot(uint32_t guid) {\n    // ... bot initialization code\
      \ ...\n    uint64_t initialMemory = GetBotMemoryUsage(guid);\n    performanceMonitor->RecordMemoryUsage(guid,\
      \ initialMemory, \"init_complete\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotPerformanceMonitor class designed for internal
    TrinityCore bot management. It assumes that memory tracking is enabled and that
    the system has sufficient resources to log these measurements without impacting
    performance significantly. The context parameter allows for flexible categorization
    of memory usage data, which can be useful for debugging or profiling purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that botGuid values are valid and correspond to active bots in
    the current session; otherwise, the recorded data may not be associated with any
    actual entity. Avoid calling this method too frequently during high-frequency
    operations as it might introduce minor overhead in performance-critical sections
    of code.
