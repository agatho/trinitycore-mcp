  method: GetPopulationManager
  signature: BotPopulationManager * BotSpawnOrchestrator::GetPopulationManager() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the population manager instance associated with the bot spawn orchestrator.
  description: The GetPopulationManager method returns a pointer to the BotPopulationManager
    object that controls the population management for bots within the orchestrator's
    scope. This manager is responsible for tracking, spawning, and managing the lifecycle
    of bot characters in the game world. The method provides access to core bot population
    functionality such as spawn limits, bot distribution, and resource allocation.
    It is typically used by systems that need to interact with or query the current
    state of bot populations managed by this orchestrator.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BotPopulationManager instance if one exists, or nullptr
    if no population manager has been initialized for this orchestrator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotPopulationManager* manager = orchestrator->GetPopulationManager();\n\
      if (manager)\n{\n    // Use the population manager\n    uint32 currentPop =\
      \ manager->GetCurrentPopulation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Manager Validity
    code: "BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = sBotSpawnOrchestrator;\nBotPopulationManager*\
      \ manager = orchestrator->GetPopulationManager();\nif (manager != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Safe to use the manager\n    manager->UpdateAllBots();\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle case where no population manager exists\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      No population manager found for orchestrator\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other bot management systems
    to coordinate bot behavior and resource usage. The returned pointer should be
    validated before use as it may be null if the orchestrator has not been properly
    initialized with a population manager.
  warnings: The returned BotPopulationManager pointer should never be deleted or modified
    directly, as it is managed by the BotSpawnOrchestrator instance. Accessing the
    manager after the orchestrator has been destroyed results in undefined behavior.
