documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DefensiveManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~DefensiveManager destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources allocated by the DefensiveManager object. This includes releasing
    any dynamically allocated memory, canceling active defensive actions, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope.
    The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a DefensiveManager
    instance is destroyed, such as when it's removed from the game world or when the
    owning unit is despawned. It ensures that all defensive behaviors are properly
    terminated and any internal state is safely reset.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DefensiveManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    DefensiveManager* manager = new DefensiveManager();\n\
      \    // ... use the manager ...\n    delete manager; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It is typically invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when objects
    go out of scope or are explicitly deleted. DefensiveManager may maintain references
    to other game entities, so proper cleanup ensures no dangling references remain
    in the system.
