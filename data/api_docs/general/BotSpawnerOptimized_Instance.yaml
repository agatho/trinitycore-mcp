  signature: BotSpawnerOptimized & BotSpawnerOptimized::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotSpawnerOptimized class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the BotSpawnerOptimized
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global bot spawner functionality
    within the TrinityCore framework. The returned reference provides access to all
    bot spawning and management capabilities, including configuration settings, spawn
    queues, and bot lifecycle management. This implementation is thread-safe and designed
    for use in multi-threaded environments common in WoW server cores.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single BotSpawnerOptimized instance. The method never
    returns a null pointer as it guarantees instantiation of the singleton object.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotSpawner Instance
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized& spawner = BotSpawnerOptimized::Instance();

      spawner.SpawnBot(12345, 67890); // Spawn a bot with given parameters'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance for Configuration Access
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized& spawner = BotSpawnerOptimized::Instance();

      uint32 maxBots = spawner.GetMaxSpawnedBots();

      spawner.SetSpawnRate(0.5f); // Configure spawn rate'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the Meyers singleton pattern, which is thread-safe in C++11
    and later. The instance is created on first access and destroyed at program termination.
    Developers should be aware that this creates a global dependency, so use sparingly
    and consider dependency injection for testability.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, excessive reliance on it can make unit testing
    difficult. Avoid calling Instance() in performance-critical code paths where the
    overhead of thread-safety checks might matter. Also, be cautious about creating
    tight coupling between components that depend on this global instance.
