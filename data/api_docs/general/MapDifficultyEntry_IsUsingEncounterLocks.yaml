  signature: bool MapDifficultyEntry::IsUsingEncounterLocks() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map difficulty uses encounter locks for content locking.
  description: The IsUsingEncounterLocks method checks if a specific map difficulty
    entry is configured to use encounter locks. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, encounter locks are used to prevent players from entering certain
    content (such as raids or dungeons) until they have completed previous encounters
    or met specific criteria. This method returns true if the map difficulty has encounter
    locking enabled, and false otherwise. The result directly affects gameplay mechanics
    related to progression and access control within instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map difficulty uses encounter locks for content access
    control; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a MapDifficultyEntry Uses Encounter Locks
    code: "MapDifficultyEntry const* difficultyEntry = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (difficultyEntry && difficultyEntry->IsUsingEncounterLocks())\n{\n    //\
      \ Handle logic for encounter-locked content\n    sLog->outString(\"This map\
      \ uses encounter locks.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"This map does\
      \ not use encounter locks.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during instance creation and player access
    checks to enforce content locking rules. It's important to note that the presence
    of encounter locks does not guarantee a player can enter an instance, as additional
    conditions such as quest completion or achievement status may also apply.
