  class: Quest
  method: GetAllowableClasses
  signature: uint32 Quest::GetAllowableClasses() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the allowable classes for a quest, indicating which player classes
    can accept the quest.
  description: The GetAllowableClasses method retrieves the bitmask representing the
    classes that are allowed to accept a specific quest. This value is used by the
    game engine to determine if a player's class can take the quest based on class
    restrictions. The returned value corresponds to the "Allowable Classes" field
    in the quest database entry, which defines the valid class combinations for the
    quest. This method is essential for quest validation and ensures that players
    only receive quests appropriate to their character class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the allowable classes bitmask. Each
    bit corresponds to a specific class (Warrior = 1, Paladin = 2, Hunter = 4, Rogue
    = 8, Priest = 16, Shaman = 32, Mage = 64, Warlock = 128, Druid = 256). The value
    can be used to check if a player's class is included in the allowed classes for
    the quest.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Class is Allowed
    code: "uint32 allowableClasses = quest->GetAllowableClasses();\nif (allowableClasses\
      \ & (1 << playerClass)) {\n    // Player's class is allowed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to validate quest acceptance. The bitmask value may be modified by game mechanics
    or expansion content, and should be interpreted carefully when checking against
    player class values.
  warnings: The method returns a raw bitmask without any validation checks; developers
    must ensure proper handling of the returned value to avoid incorrect quest acceptance
    decisions.
