  class: LootDistribution
  method: InvalidatePlayerCache
  signature: void LootDistribution::InvalidatePlayerCache(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates the cached loot distribution data for a specific player.
  description: The InvalidatePlayerCache method clears any cached loot distribution
    information associated with the specified player GUID. This ensures that subsequent
    loot distribution operations will fetch fresh data instead of using stale cached
    values. The method is typically invoked when player state changes in a way that
    could affect loot eligibility or distribution, such as when a player rejoins a
    group or when loot rules are updated. It helps maintain consistency in the loot
    system by preventing outdated cache entries from influencing new loot decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose cached loot data
      should be invalidated. This value must correspond to a valid player entity within
      the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating cache for a specific player
    code: 'LootDistribution::InvalidatePlayerCache(12345);

      // This call invalidates any cached loot data for the player with GUID 12345.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Invalidating cache after a group change
    code: "void OnPlayerGroupChange(Player* player)\n{\n    LootDistribution::InvalidatePlayerCache(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \    // Invalidate loot cache when player's group membership changes\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a per-player basis and does not affect global loot
    distribution settings. The internal caching mechanism may vary depending on the
    implementation details of the LootDistribution class, but typically involves storing
    temporary data structures keyed by player GUIDs.
