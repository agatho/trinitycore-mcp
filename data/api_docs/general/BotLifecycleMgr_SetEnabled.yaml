documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the bot lifecycle management system.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the bot lifecycle management
    system is active within the TrinityCore server. When enabled, the system manages
    the creation, destruction, and behavior of AI-controlled bots. When disabled,
    bot functionality is suspended and existing bots may be removed from the game
    world. This method is typically used during server startup, configuration changes,
    or administrative commands to toggle bot availability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Bot System
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Bot System
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal state changes that affect all active
    bot instances. It may be called from server configuration scripts or administrative
    interfaces. The change takes effect immediately for new bot operations, but existing
    bots might not be instantly affected depending on implementation details.
