documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ChaseMovementGenerator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ChaseMovementGenerator class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the operation of this movement generator. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this class is typically used to manage AI-driven chasing behavior
    for creatures or NPCs. When the movement generator is destroyed, it ensures proper
    cleanup of internal state and prevents memory leaks. This destructor is automatically
    invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ChaseMovementGenerator
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    ChaseMovementGenerator* generator = new ChaseMovementGenerator(target,\
      \ distance);\n    // ... use the generator ...\n    delete generator; // Destructor\
      \ is called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's typically invoked by the system when the movement generator is
    no longer needed, such as when an NPC stops chasing a target or when the AI system
    is reset.
