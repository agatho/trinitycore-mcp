  class: SmartScriptHolder
  method: GetScriptType
  signature: uint32 SmartScriptHolder::GetScriptType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script type identifier associated with this SmartScriptHolder
    instance.
  description: The GetScriptType method returns a unique numerical identifier that
    defines the type of script this SmartScriptHolder is managing. In TrinityCore's
    AI system, script types determine how smart scripts are processed and executed
    for different game entities such as creatures, game objects, or areas. This value
    is typically set during script initialization and remains constant throughout
    the object's lifetime. The returned value corresponds to predefined script type
    constants used internally by the SmartScript system to route events and actions
    appropriately.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the script type identifier. Common values include
    SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_CREATURE (1), SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT (2), and SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_AREATRIGGER
    (3). This identifier is used by the SmartScript system to determine how to process
    the associated script events and actions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SmartScriptHolder* holder = new SmartScriptHolder();\nuint32 scriptType\
      \ = holder->GetScriptType();\nif (scriptType == SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_CREATURE)\n\
      {\n    // Handle creature-specific smart script logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Script Type Validation
    code: "void ValidateScriptType(SmartScriptHolder* holder)\n{\n    uint32 type\
      \ = holder->GetScriptType();\n    switch (type)\n    {\n        case SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_CREATURE:\n\
      \        case SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT:\n        case SMART_SCRIPT_TYPE_AREATRIGGER:\n\
      \            // Valid script types\n            break;\n        default:\n \
      \           // Handle invalid or unexpected script type\n            break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not perform any expensive operations.
    It directly returns a cached value stored within the SmartScriptHolder instance.
    The script type should be set during object initialization and should not change
    after the script has been registered with the SmartScript system.
  warnings: Do not modify the script type value returned by this method, as it may
    lead to inconsistent behavior in the SmartScript execution engine. Ensure that
    the script type matches the actual entity type being scripted to avoid runtime
    errors or unexpected behavior.
