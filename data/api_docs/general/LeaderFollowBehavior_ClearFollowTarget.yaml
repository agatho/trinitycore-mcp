  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::ClearFollowTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the current follow target for the leader-follow behavior.
  description: The ClearFollowTarget method removes the currently set follow target
    from the LeaderFollowBehavior instance. This method is typically used when a creature
    or unit needs to stop following a specific target, such as when the target dies,
    becomes unreachable, or when the follow behavior should be terminated. The method
    ensures that any internal references to the previous follow target are properly
    reset, allowing the AI to transition to other states or behaviors. It does not
    perform any validation on whether a target was previously set, making it safe
    to call even when no target exists.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = unit->GetAI()->GetBehavior<LeaderFollowBehavior>();

      behavior->ClearFollowTarget();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system when a follow
    target becomes invalid or when the AI state transitions. It's important to ensure
    that any external references to the cleared target are also handled appropriately
    to prevent dangling pointers.
