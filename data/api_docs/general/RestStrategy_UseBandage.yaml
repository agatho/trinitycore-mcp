  class: RestStrategy
  method: UseBandage
  signature: bool RestStrategy::UseBandage(BotAI * ai, Item * bandage)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to use a bandage item on the bot's owner if they are injured.
  description: The UseBandage method checks if the provided bandage item is valid
    and usable, then attempts to apply it to the bot's owner if their health is below
    maximum. This method is typically used in AI strategies to maintain the bot's
    health during rest periods. The method will return false if the bandage cannot
    be used or if the owner does not need healing. It integrates with the TrinityCore's
    item usage and player health systems.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the bot. Used to access
      AI context and player information.
  - name: bandage
    description: Pointer to the Item object representing the bandage to be used. Must
      be a valid bandage item with proper item template data.
  returns: Returns true if the bandage was successfully applied to the owner, false
    otherwise. This includes cases where the bandage is invalid, the owner has full
    health, or the usage fails for any reason.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Rest Strategy
    code: "bool result = strategy->UseBandage(ai, bandageItem);\nif (result)\n{\n\
      \    ai->TellMaster(\"Used a bandage on myself.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Bandage Usage
    code: "if (owner->GetHealth() < owner->GetMaxHealth())\n{\n    Item* bandage =\
      \ ai->GetBot()->GetItemByProto(12345); // Get specific bandage\n    if (bandage)\n\
      \    {\n        strategy->UseBandage(ai, bandage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the bot's owner having a valid health state and the
    bandage item being properly initialized. The AI context must be active for proper
    item usage checks. Performance is generally low as it involves item validation
    and player state checks.
  warnings: Do not call this method without verifying that the bandage item is valid
    and usable. Calling with null parameters may cause crashes or undefined behavior.
    Ensure the bot's owner has sufficient health to benefit from the bandage before
    calling.
