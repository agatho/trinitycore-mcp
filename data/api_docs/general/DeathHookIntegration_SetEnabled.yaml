  class: DeathHookIntegration
  method: SetEnabled
  signature: void DeathHookIntegration::SetEnabled(bool enabled)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the death hook integration functionality.
  description: The SetEnabled method controls whether the DeathHookIntegration feature
    is active within the TrinityCore server. When enabled, this integration allows
    custom logic to be executed upon player deaths, such as triggering events, modifying
    loot distribution, or executing scripted behaviors. The method directly toggles
    an internal boolean flag that determines if death-related hooks should be processed.
    This functionality is typically used by custom modules or addons that extend the
    core gameplay mechanics during player death scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: enabled
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the death hook integration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Death Hook Integration
    code: DeathHookIntegration::SetEnabled(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Death Hook Integration
    code: DeathHookIntegration::SetEnabled(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or configuration
    loading. The change takes effect immediately and affects all subsequent player
    death events. It's recommended to call this method before any players are online
    to avoid inconsistent behavior.
  warnings: Calling SetEnabled while players are actively dying may lead to undefined
    behavior or missed hooks. Always ensure the integration is properly initialized
    before enabling it in a live environment.
