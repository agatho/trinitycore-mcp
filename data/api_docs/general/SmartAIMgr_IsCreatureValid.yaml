    entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a creature entry is valid within the SmartAI system
  description: The IsCreatureValid method checks whether a given creature entry ID
    is recognized and valid within the SmartAI framework. This validation ensures
    that scripted behaviors are only applied to creatures that exist in the game database
    and are properly configured for SmartAI scripting. The method typically performs
    checks against internal creature registry data structures to confirm the existence
    and proper initialization of the creature entry before allowing SmartAI scripts
    to be executed on it. This helps prevent runtime errors when attempting to apply
    AI behaviors to non-existent or improperly registered creatures.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the script
      data and context information for validation
  - name: entry
    description: The creature entry ID to validate against the SmartAI registry. Must
      correspond to a valid creature template in the database
  returns: Returns true if the creature entry is valid and recognized by the SmartAI
    system, false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that either
    the creature entry does not exist in the database or has not been properly initialized
    for SmartAI usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "SmartScriptHolder script;\nuint32 creatureEntry = 12345;\nif (sSmartAIMgr->IsCreatureValid(script,\
      \ creatureEntry)) {\n    // Proceed with SmartAI script execution\n    sSmartAIMgr->ExecuteScript(script,\
      \ creatureEntry);\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid creature entry\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Invalid creature entry %u for SmartAI script\", creatureEntry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in AI event handler
    code: "void CreatureAI::OnAIUpdate(uint32 diff) {\n    if (!sSmartAIMgr->IsCreatureValid(m_scriptHolder,\
      \ GetEntry())) {\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with normal AI processing\n\
      \    ProcessSmartAIScripts();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups or registry checks to validate
    creature entries. It should be called before attempting to execute SmartAI scripts
    on creatures to prevent runtime errors. The validation process may involve checking
    against the creature_template table and ensuring proper AI configuration flags
    are set.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid entry ID may cause performance degradation
    due to database lookups. Always ensure that creature entries are properly registered
    in the database before using this validation method.
