  class: WheatyExceptionReport
  method: DereferenceUnsafePointer
  signature: DWORD_PTR WheatyExceptionReport::DereferenceUnsafePointer(DWORD_PTR address)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to safely dereference a potentially invalid memory address and returns
    the value at that location.
  description: The DereferenceUnsafePointer method in the WheatyExceptionReport class
    is designed to attempt reading data from a specified memory address, even if that
    address might be invalid or unmapped. This functionality is typically used in
    crash reporting or debugging scenarios where an exception handler needs to inspect
    memory contents without causing additional crashes. The method performs a controlled
    read operation and returns the value found at the given address, or a default
    value if the read fails. It's important to note that this method does not perform
    any validation on the input address before attempting to dereference it, making
    it inherently dangerous if used incorrectly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the DWORD_PTR value stored at the specified memory address. If
    the address is invalid or inaccessible, the behavior is undefined and may return
    garbage data or cause an access violation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handler
    code: "DWORD_PTR value = report.DereferenceUnsafePointer(exceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionAddress);\n\
      if (value != 0) {\n    // Process the dereferenced value\n    printf(\"Value\
      \ at address: 0x%p is 0x%08X\\n\", exceptionInfo->ExceptionRecord->ExceptionAddress,\
      \ value);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be used in controlled debugging or crash reporting
    contexts. It bypasses normal memory protection mechanisms and can lead to further
    crashes if the address is invalid. The method name implies it's designed for handling
    unsafe pointers, but calling it with invalid addresses will likely result in an
    access violation unless proper exception handling is in place.
  warnings: Using this method with invalid or unmapped memory addresses will almost
    certainly cause a crash or undefined behavior. It should never be used in production
    code without proper error handling and validation. This method is primarily intended
    for debugging and crash analysis tools, not for normal game logic execution.
