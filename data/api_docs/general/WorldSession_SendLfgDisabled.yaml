  class: WorldSession
  method: SendLfgDisabled
  signature: void WorldSession::SendLfgDisabled()
documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to the client indicating that the LFG system is disabled.
  description: The SendLfgDisabled method sends a specific protocol message to the
    connected client informing it that the Looking for Group (LFG) system has been
    disabled server-side. This typically occurs when the LFG system is globally turned
    off or when the player's current zone or game state does not support LFG functionality.
    The method does not take any parameters and performs no return operations, serving
    purely as a notification mechanism to update the client's user interface accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Server Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    WorldSession* session =\
      \ player->GetSession();\n    if (!IsLfgEnabled())\n    {\n        session->SendLfgDisabled();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or when LFG status changes
    dynamically. It's part of the TrinityCore's communication protocol with the client
    and relies on proper packet handling to ensure UI updates are synchronized.
