  signature: uint32 AuctionHouseObject::GetAuctionHouseId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the auction house associated with this object
  description: The GetAuctionHouseId method retrieves the internal identifier that
    uniquely identifies the auction house instance to which this AuctionHouseObject
    belongs. This ID is used internally by the TrinityCore server to distinguish between
    different auction houses, such as those in different cities or for different factions.
    The returned value corresponds to the ID field in the auctionhouse table within
    the database, and it's essential for linking auction items to their respective
    auction houses during operations like listing, browsing, and purchasing. This
    method is typically called when processing auction-related actions that require
    knowledge of which auction house an item belongs to or where it should be processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier of the auction house.
    This ID maps directly to entries in the `auctionhouse` database table and is used
    internally by the server for routing auction operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Auction House
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject* ah = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      uint32 houseId = ah->GetAuctionHouseId();

      TC_LOG_INFO("auction", "Current auction house ID: %u", houseId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Auction House ID for Filtering Auctions
    code: 'AuctionHouseObject* ah = ...;

      uint32 currentHouseId = ah->GetAuctionHouseId();

      // Filter auctions by house ID

      QueryResult result = CharacterDatabase.Query("SELECT item_template, item_guid
      FROM auctionhouse WHERE auctionhouse_id = {}", currentHouseId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter and does not perform any computation or database
    lookups. It returns a cached value that was set during object initialization.
    The AuctionHouseObject should be properly initialized with a valid auction house
    ID before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly constructed AuctionHouseObject
    may return an invalid or zero ID, which could lead to incorrect behavior in auction
    processing logic if not checked for validity.
