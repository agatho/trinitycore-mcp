documentation:
  brief: Disables emergency mode in the target selector, restoring normal targeting
    behavior.
  description: The DisableEmergencyMode method turns off the emergency targeting state
    within the TargetSelector class. When emergency mode is active, the AI typically
    prioritizes immediate threats or specific target conditions over normal targeting
    logic. This method resets the internal state to disable that behavior and allows
    the target selector to resume standard targeting procedures. The method has no
    parameters and does not return any value. It is typically called when the AI system
    determines that the emergency condition has been resolved or when returning to
    regular combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TargetSelector* selector = GetTargetSelector();

      selector->DisableEmergencyMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    TargetSelector class to indicate that emergency mode is no longer active. It should
    be called after handling any emergency conditions that were previously triggering
    special targeting behavior.
