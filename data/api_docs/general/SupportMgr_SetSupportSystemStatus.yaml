  class: SupportMgr
  method: SetSupportSystemStatus
  signature: void SupportMgr::SetSupportSystemStatus(bool status)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the support system within the TrinityCore server instance.
  description: The SetSupportSystemStatus method controls the operational state of
    the support system, which may include features such as ticket handling, player
    assistance, or administrative tools. This method allows server administrators
    to toggle the support system on or off dynamically without requiring a server
    restart. The status change affects all players and GMs who interact with support-related
    functionality. When enabled, the system processes incoming requests and provides
    assistance; when disabled, these services are temporarily suspended.
  parameters:
  - name: status
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the support system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Support System
    code: SupportMgr::instance()->SetSupportSystemStatus(true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Support System
    code: SupportMgr::instance()->SetSupportSystemStatus(false);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates an internal flag within the SupportMgr singleton
    that is checked by other system components. It may also trigger notifications
    or logging events when the status changes.
