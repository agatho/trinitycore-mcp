  class: NonTankTargetSelector
  method: NonTankTargetSelector
  signature: void NonTankTargetSelector::NonTankTargetSelector(Unit * source, bool
    playerOnly)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a NonTankTargetSelector with the specified source unit and player-only
    filtering option.
  description: The NonTankTargetSelector constructor initializes a target selection
    mechanism that identifies units suitable for targeting, excluding tank roles.
    This selector is commonly used in AI behavior trees to determine appropriate targets
    for non-tank classes or abilities. When playerOnly is set to true, the selector
    will only consider player-controlled units as valid targets, filtering out all
    creature and NPC targets. The source parameter defines the unit that will be using
    this target selection logic, which is essential for context-aware targeting decisions
    in combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will utilize this target selector.
      This represents the entity performing the targeting action and is crucial for
      determining valid targets based on faction, threat, and role.
  - name: playerOnly
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to restrict target selection to player-controlled
      units only. When true, non-player units (creatures, NPCs) are excluded from
      consideration. When false, all eligible units may be considered as targets.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Unit* myTarget = ...;

      NonTankTargetSelector selector(myTarget, true);

      // Initializes selector to only consider player targets'
    language: cpp
  - title: Mixed Target Selection
    code: 'Unit* enemy = ...;

      NonTankTargetSelector selector(enemy, false);

      // Initializes selector to consider both players and creatures as targets'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any target selection immediately. It merely
    sets up the internal state of the selector. Actual target selection occurs when
    calling methods like SelectTarget() or similar on the selector instance. The source
    unit must be valid and properly initialized before passing it to this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the source parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes during target selection operations. Always ensure that the
    source unit is valid and alive before initializing this selector.
