documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestCache instance with default values and prepares internal
    data structures for quest-related caching operations.
  description: The QuestCache constructor initializes a new instance of the QuestCache
    class. This method sets up the internal data structures required for caching quest
    information, including initializing maps and containers that will store quest
    data for efficient retrieval. The constructor ensures that all necessary resources
    are allocated and configured properly before the cache can be used for quest-related
    operations. It is typically called automatically when creating a new QuestCache
    object, and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required by advanced
    use cases. This initialization process is crucial for maintaining performance
    in quest handling within the TrinityCore framework.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a QuestCache instance
    code: 'QuestCache* cache = new QuestCache();

      // The constructor automatically initializes internal structures

      // and prepares the cache for quest data operations.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method, not a regular function. It should only be called
    during object instantiation. The initialization process may involve memory allocation
    and setup of internal hash maps or other data structures used for fast quest lookup.
    Performance considerations include the time taken to initialize these internal
    structures, though this is typically minimal.
