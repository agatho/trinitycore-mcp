documentation:
  brief: Returns the assigned position index within a formation for the creature or
    unit.
  description: The GetAssignedPosition method retrieves the specific position index
    that has been assigned to this unit within its formation. This is typically used
    in AI logic to determine where a creature should be positioned relative to its
    leader or other members of the group. The returned value represents an integer
    index that corresponds to a particular slot in the formation layout, which can
    be used for movement calculations and positioning logic. This method is commonly
    called during pathfinding or formation update routines to ensure units maintain
    their proper spatial relationship within the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the assigned position index within the formation.
    A value of -1 typically indicates that no position has been assigned yet, while
    positive integers correspond to specific slots in the formation structure (e.g.,
    0 for first position, 1 for second, etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (FormationManager*\
      \ fm = GetFormation())\n    {\n        int position = fm->GetAssignedPosition();\n\
      \        if (position >= 0)\n        {\n            // Use the assigned position\
      \ for formation movement\n            MoveToFormationPosition(position);\n \
      \       }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the unit has already been assigned to a formation.
    If called on a unit not part of any formation, it may return -1 or an undefined
    value depending on implementation details. The position index returned is typically
    zero-based and corresponds directly to the formation's internal data structure.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying that the unit actually
    belongs to a formation, as returning -1 might indicate an error condition rather
    than a valid position assignment. Also, ensure that the formation manager instance
    is valid before calling this method to avoid potential crashes.
