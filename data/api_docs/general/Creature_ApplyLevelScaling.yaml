  class: Creature
  method: ApplyLevelScaling
  signature: void Creature::ApplyLevelScaling()
documentation:
  brief: Applies level scaling to the creature based on its current level and game
    mechanics.
  description: This method adjusts the creature's stats and attributes according to
    the current level of the creature, ensuring that the creature's abilities and
    health points are properly scaled for the level. It is typically used during creature
    initialization or when a creature's level changes during gameplay. The method
    modifies internal values such as health, mana, damage, and other stat-related
    properties based on the creature's level. This scaling ensures that creatures
    remain balanced with respect to player progression and game difficulty.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->ApplyLevelScaling();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    creature creation or level updates, and developers should not need to call it
    explicitly unless specifically required. Performance-wise, this method involves
    calculations that may impact server performance if applied to many creatures simultaneously.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly on creatures whose level has
    already been set, as it may cause conflicts with existing scaling logic. It is
    recommended to use this method only when creating new creatures or updating their
    level in a controlled manner.
