  class: NPCEventBus
  method: DeliverEvent
  signature: void NPCEventBus::DeliverEvent(const NPCEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Delivers a NPC event to all registered listeners in the event bus.
  description: The DeliverEvent method broadcasts a given NPCEvent to all subscribers
    of the NPCEventBus. This mechanism allows for decoupled communication between
    different parts of the game logic, enabling systems such as quest triggers, AI
    behavior modifications, or interaction responses to be notified when specific
    events occur. The event is dispatched synchronously to all registered handlers,
    ensuring that any side effects or state changes are applied immediately upon delivery.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The NPCEvent object containing the event data and type to be delivered
      to all listeners. This parameter must not be null or invalid.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Delivery
    code: 'NPCEventBus& bus = sNPCEventBus;

      NPCEvent event;

      event.type = NPC_EVENT_TYPE_QUEST_ACCEPTED;

      event.data.questId = 12345;

      bus.DeliverEvent(event);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering an AI Behavior Change
    code: 'NPCEventBus& bus = sNPCEventBus;

      NPCEvent event;

      event.type = NPC_EVENT_TYPE_PLAYER_APPROACH;

      event.data.playerGuid = player->GetGUID();

      bus.DeliverEvent(event); // Notifies all AI systems about player approach'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework where NPC events are central to dynamic gameplay mechanics. It supports
    a publish-subscribe pattern for efficient event propagation without tight coupling
    between components.
