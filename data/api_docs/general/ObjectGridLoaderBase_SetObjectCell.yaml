  signature: void ObjectGridLoaderBase::SetObjectCell(MapObject * obj, const CellCoord
    & cellCoord)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cell coordinate for a map object within the grid loader system
  description: The SetObjectCell method assigns a specific cell coordinate to a MapObject,
    enabling proper spatial indexing and management within the TrinityCore map grid
    system. This method is crucial for maintaining object visibility and interaction
    within player-defined cell boundaries. The operation updates internal data structures
    that track which objects reside in which cells, supporting efficient object loading,
    unloading, and visibility calculations. It ensures that objects are correctly
    placed in the grid hierarchy for optimal performance during world updates and
    player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the MapObject whose cell coordinate is being set. Must
      not be null and should represent a valid object in the game world.
  - name: cellCoord
    description: Reference to the CellCoord structure defining the target cell coordinates
      for the object. Represents the X and Y grid coordinates within the map's cell
      system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MapObject* player = ...;

      CellCoord cell(5, 10);

      objectGridLoader.SetObjectCell(player, cell);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Object Cell During Movement
    code: "void UpdatePlayerCell(Player* player, int32 newX, int32 newY) {\n    CellCoord\
      \ newCell(newX, newY);\n    objectGridLoader.SetObjectCell(player->ToMapObject(),\
      \ newCell);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the grid management system
    when objects move between cells. Developers should not call this directly unless
    implementing custom grid behavior. The method assumes that the object has already
    been initialized and registered with the grid system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null object pointer will likely
    cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the MapObject is properly initialized
    before calling this method. Avoid frequent calls to this method during high-frequency
    updates as it may impact performance.
