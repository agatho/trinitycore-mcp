documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Mage AI is currently casting a spell
  description: The IsCasting method determines whether the Mage AI character is in
    the middle of casting a spell. This utility function is commonly used within the
    AI logic to prevent interrupting ongoing casts or to delay actions until a cast
    completes. The method typically checks internal state flags or spell cast information
    maintained by the AI system. It's particularly useful for implementing intelligent
    spell prioritization and avoiding invalid action sequences during combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Mage AI is currently casting a spell, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (!mageAI->IsCasting()) {\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsCasting to prevent spell overlap
    code: "if (!mageAI->IsCasting() && target->GetHealthPct() < 30) {\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_BLAST_WAVE);\n\
      } else if (!mageAI->IsCasting()) {\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SPELL_FROST_NOVA);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI state tracking and may not reflect real-time
    casting status in all edge cases. The implementation likely checks for active
    spell cast timers or spell queue states rather than direct spell channeling flags.
  warnings: Do not use this method to determine if a spell was successfully cast -
    it only indicates casting state. Also, be aware that the AI might have delayed
    actions queued which could affect behavior even when IsCasting() returns false.
