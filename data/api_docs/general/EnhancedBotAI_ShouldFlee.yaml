  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: ShouldFlee
  signature: bool EnhancedBotAI::ShouldFlee()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot should flee from its current target based on health
    and combat state.
  description: The ShouldFlee method evaluates the bot's current combat status and
    health percentage to decide if it should initiate a retreat behavior. This method
    is typically used within the EnhancedBotAI class to control when a bot should
    abandon aggressive actions and attempt to escape from dangerous situations. The
    decision-making process considers factors such as the bot's current health level,
    threat level from the target, and whether the bot is in a valid combat state.
    It returns true if fleeing is deemed necessary for survival, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot should flee from its current target based on health
    and combat conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (botAI->ShouldFlee()) {\n    botAI->Flee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    regularly during combat updates. The exact health threshold for fleeing may vary
    based on bot configuration or difficulty settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot's combat state is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as undefined behavior may occur if the bot is not in a valid combat
    context.
