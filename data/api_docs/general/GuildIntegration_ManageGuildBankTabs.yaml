  class: GuildIntegration
  method: ManageGuildBankTabs
  signature: void GuildIntegration::ManageGuildBankTabs(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Manages guild bank tab operations for a specified player.
  description: The ManageGuildBankTabs method handles the core functionality related
    to guild bank tab management within the TrinityCore framework. This method is
    responsible for processing player interactions with guild bank tabs, including
    retrieving, updating, and synchronizing tab configurations and contents. It serves
    as an integration point between player actions and the underlying guild bank system,
    ensuring that changes made to guild bank tabs are properly persisted and propagated
    throughout the game world. The method likely performs validation checks on player
    permissions and guild membership before executing any tab management operations.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) who is performing the guild bank tab management action. This parameter
      identifies which player's session and permissions should be used for the operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Bank Tab Management
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.ManageGuildBankTabs(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Session Handling
    code: "void HandleGuildBankTabUpdate(Player* player)\n{\n    int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\n\
      \    GuildIntegration guildInt;\n    guildInt.ManageGuildBankTabs(&playerId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates within the context of a larger guild management
    system and may be called during player login, bank tab interaction events, or
    administrative operations. It's important to note that proper player authentication
    and guild membership validation should occur before this method is invoked to
    prevent unauthorized access to guild bank tabs.
  warnings: Incorrect handling of the player parameter could lead to security vulnerabilities
    or unexpected behavior in guild bank operations. The method assumes valid player
    GUID input and does not perform explicit null checks on the pointer parameter.
