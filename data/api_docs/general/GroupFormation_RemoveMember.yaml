  class: GroupFormation
  method: RemoveMember
  signature: void GroupFormation::RemoveMember(uint32 memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a member from the group formation.
  description: The RemoveMember method removes a specified group member identified
    by their GUID from the current group formation. This operation typically occurs
    when a player leaves a group or is removed by an administrative action. The method
    ensures that internal group state tracking is updated accordingly, and any associated
    formation data for the removed member is cleaned up. It is commonly used in conjunction
    with group management systems within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member to be removed. This
      value must correspond to a valid player GUID currently in the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Player from Group
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = ...;

      uint32 playerGuid = 123456;

      formation->RemoveMember(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided memberGuid corresponds to an existing
    group member. It does not perform validation on whether the GUID is valid or active;
    it's expected that such checks are handled before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling RemoveMember with an invalid or non-existent memberGuid may lead
    to undefined behavior or internal inconsistencies in the group formation system.
    Ensure proper error handling and group state validation before invoking this method.
