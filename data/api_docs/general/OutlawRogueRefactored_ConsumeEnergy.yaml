  class: OutlawRogueRefactored
  method: ConsumeEnergy
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::ConsumeEnergy(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified amount of energy from the Outlaw Rogue's energy resource.
  description: The ConsumeEnergy method reduces the energy level of an Outlaw Rogue
    by the specified amount. This method is typically used during ability execution
    to deduct energy costs from the rogue's resource pool. The energy consumption
    directly affects the rogue's ability to perform actions such as Sinister Strike,
    Between the Eyes, or other energy-based abilities. The method ensures that energy
    cannot drop below zero, and it may trigger energy-related cooldowns or state changes
    depending on the implementation details of the rogue class.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of energy to consume from the rogue's current energy
      pool. Must be a non-negative integer value representing energy units.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Energy Consumption
    code: 'OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.ConsumeEnergy(25); // Deducts 25 energy units from the rogue''s pool'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Energy Consumption
    code: "if (rogue.GetEnergy() >= 30) {\n    rogue.ConsumeEnergy(30);\n    // Proceed\
      \ with energy-intensive ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the base Player or Unit class's energy
    management system. It may be called internally by ability execution logic to enforce
    energy cost requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter does not exceed the rogue's current energy
    level, as this could lead to undefined behavior or resource depletion issues if
    not properly validated before calling.
