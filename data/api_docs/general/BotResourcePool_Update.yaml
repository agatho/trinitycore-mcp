documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot resource pool state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing and refreshing the internal
    state of a bot resource pool. It processes any pending resource allocations, updates
    timers, and ensures that the pool maintains accurate counts of available resources.
    This method is typically called from the game loop at regular intervals to keep
    the resource management system synchronized with the current game time. The method
    does not directly interact with external systems but rather manages internal data
    structures related to bot resource consumption and replenishment.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetUptime();\n    botResourcePool->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to maintain accurate
    resource pool state. It is designed to be efficient and not block execution for
    extended periods. The diff parameter represents milliseconds since last update,
    which is crucial for time-based calculations.
