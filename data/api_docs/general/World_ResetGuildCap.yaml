documentation:
  brief: Resets the guild cap to its default value.
  description: The ResetGuildCap method resets the maximum number of guilds allowed
    per player to the server's default configuration. This function is typically used
    during server maintenance or configuration updates to ensure that guild limitations
    are properly enforced according to the current world settings. It does not take
    any parameters and performs no validation checks, directly applying the reset
    operation to the internal guild cap state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Guild Cap
    code: World::instance()->ResetGuildCap();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the global guild cap setting and should be
    used carefully during server configuration changes or maintenance windows. It
    is not thread-safe and should only be called from a single-threaded context.
  warnings: Calling this method during active gameplay may cause unexpected behavior
    if players are already in guilds that exceed the new cap. Ensure all guilds are
    validated after calling this function.
