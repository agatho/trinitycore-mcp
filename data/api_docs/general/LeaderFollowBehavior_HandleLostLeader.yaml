documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a bot loses its leader in the LeaderFollowBehavior
    AI system
  description: The HandleLostLeader method is invoked within the LeaderFollowBehavior
    class to manage the behavior of a bot when it no longer has a valid leader to
    follow. This typically occurs when the leader becomes unavailable, dies, or disconnects
    from the game. The method ensures that the bot transitions gracefully from a following
    state back to an idle or default state, potentially re-evaluating its role within
    the group and resetting any follower-specific actions or targets. It may also
    trigger cleanup routines for resources associated with the leader-following behavior.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (m_leader == nullptr)\n    {\n      \
      \  m_followBehavior->HandleLostLeader(this);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a leader
    is no longer valid. It's important to ensure that any cleanup or state reset logic
    within this method does not interfere with other ongoing AI processes or cause
    race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
