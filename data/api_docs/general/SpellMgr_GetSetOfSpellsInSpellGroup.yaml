  class: SpellMgr
  method: GetSetOfSpellsInSpellGroup
  signature: void SpellMgr::GetSetOfSpellsInSpellGroup(SpellGroup group_id, int &
    foundSpells, int & usedGroups) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates counters for spells and groups found within a specified spell group.
  description: The GetSetOfSpellsInSpellGroup method retrieves information about the
    number of individual spells and nested spell groups contained within a given SpellGroup.
    This method is typically used during spell system initialization or validation
    to understand the composition of spell groups, which are collections of related
    spells often used for effects like set bonuses, talent interactions, or spell
    synergy mechanics. The method does not return the actual spell IDs or group IDs
    but instead updates the provided reference parameters with counts of found spells
    and used groups. It's important to note that this method operates on pre-defined
    spell group definitions within the TrinityCore database and should be called after
    spell data has been loaded.
  parameters:
  - name: group_id
    description: The SpellGroup identifier specifying which spell group to analyze.
      This value must correspond to a valid spell group defined in the database.
  - name: foundSpells
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the count of individual
      spells found within the specified spell group.
  - name: usedGroups
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the count of nested
      spell groups found within the specified spell group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Count Spells and Groups in a Spell Group
    code: 'SpellGroup myGroup = SPELL_GROUP_SET_BONUS_1;

      int spellCount = 0;

      int groupCount = 0;

      spellMgr->GetSetOfSpellsInSpellGroup(myGroup, spellCount, groupCount);

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_SPELLS, "Spell Group %u contains %d spells and %d subgroups.",
      myGroup, spellCount, groupCount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used for internal spell system validation and debugging
    purposes. The implementation relies on pre-loaded spell group data from the database,
    so calling this method before spell loading may result in incorrect counts. Performance
    impact is minimal as it only updates counters without retrieving full spell lists.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpellGroup identifier passed to this method is valid and
    corresponds to an existing group in the database; otherwise, results may be unpredictable
    or lead to incorrect counts. This method modifies its parameters by reference,
    so ensure variables are initialized before calling.
