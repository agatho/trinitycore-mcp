  method: GetSeatAddonForSeatOfPassenger
  signature: const VehicleSeatAddon * Vehicle::GetSeatAddonForSeatOfPassenger(const
    Unit * passenger) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the seat addon data for the specified passenger's current seat
    in the vehicle.
  description: This method retrieves the VehicleSeatAddon structure associated with
    the seat occupied by the given passenger unit. The VehicleSeatAddon contains additional
    configuration data for vehicle seats, such as whether the seat is occupied, its
    orientation, and other seat-specific properties. This method is typically used
    to access seat-specific behavior or data when a passenger is aboard a vehicle.
    It assumes that the passenger is currently seated in a vehicle and returns NULL
    if no valid seat addon data can be found for the passenger's current seat.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the VehicleSeatAddon structure associated with the passenger's
    current seat, or NULL if the passenger is not in a vehicle or no addon data exists
    for their seat.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Passenger Has Seat Addon Data
    code: "if (Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle()) {\n    const VehicleSeatAddon*\
      \ addon = vehicle->GetSeatAddonForSeatOfPassenger(player);\n    if (addon) {\n\
      \        // Use addon data for custom behavior\n        sLog->outString(\"Passenger\
      \ has seat addon data.\");\n    } else {\n        sLog->outString(\"No seat\
      \ addon data found for passenger.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on the internal vehicle seat mapping and assumes that the
    passenger unit is properly registered with the vehicle. It does not perform any
    validation of the passenger's presence in a vehicle before attempting to retrieve
    the addon data.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer is always valid; it may be NULL
    if the passenger is not seated or if seat addon data is missing. Always check
    for null before using the returned value.
