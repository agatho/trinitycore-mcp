    for a specific quest, retrieving information from database fields that define
    how visual effects are applied to quest objectives. The method processes the provided
    fields array to extract relevant visual effect parameters such as particle effects,

  notes: This method is typically called during quest initialization and requires
    proper database field formatting. The fields array should contain valid visual
    effect data that corresponds to the quest's objective requirements.
  warnings: Improper handling of fields array may result in missing or incorrect visual
    effects for quest objectives, potentially affecting player experience and quest
    completion.
