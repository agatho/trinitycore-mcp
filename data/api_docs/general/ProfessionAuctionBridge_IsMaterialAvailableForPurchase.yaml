  class: ProfessionAuctionBridge
  method: IsMaterialAvailableForPurchase
  signature: bool ProfessionAuctionBridge::IsMaterialAvailableForPurchase(int * player,
    uint32 itemId, uint32 quantity, uint32 maxPricePerUnit) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has sufficient materials available for purchase at the
    auction house.
  description: The IsMaterialAvailableForPurchase method determines whether a specified
    player can afford to purchase a given quantity of an item at or below a maximum
    price per unit. This method is typically used in conjunction with profession-related
    auction mechanics within the TrinityCore framework, ensuring that players have
    the necessary resources (such as gold or other materials) before allowing them
    to complete an auction transaction. It validates both the player's inventory and
    financial capacity against the requested purchase parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object representing the individual attempting
      to make the purchase. Must not be null.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item being considered for purchase. This
      corresponds to an entry in the game's item database.
  - name: quantity
    description: Number of units of the specified item that the player wishes to acquire.
  - name: maxPricePerUnit
    description: Maximum amount of currency (in copper) the player is willing to pay
      per unit of the item.
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient materials and funds to complete
    the purchase; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 itemId = 12345;\nuint32 quantity = 10;\n\
      uint32 maxPricePerUnit = 5000;\n\nif (ProfessionAuctionBridge::IsMaterialAvailableForPurchase(player,\
      \ itemId, quantity, maxPricePerUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with auction purchase\
      \ logic\n}\nelse {\n    // Handle insufficient resources or funds\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player object is valid and properly initialized.
    It does not perform any direct database queries but relies on cached data from
    the player's current inventory and currency state.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as passing a null reference will result in undefined behavior. Also, note that
    this function checks only immediate availability and does not account for future
    transactions or pending purchases.
