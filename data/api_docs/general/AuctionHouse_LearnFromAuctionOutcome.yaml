  signature: void AuctionHouse::LearnFromAuctionOutcome(int * player, uint32 auctionId,
    bool wasSuccessful)
documentation:
  brief: Updates auction house learning state based on auction outcome for a player.
  description: The LearnFromAuctionOutcome method processes the result of an auction
    transaction to update internal learning mechanisms within the auction house system.
    It takes into account whether the auction was successful or not, and adjusts the
    auction house's behavior accordingly. This method is typically called after an
    auction completes, either through purchase or expiration, to help the system learn
    from transaction patterns. The method modifies internal state related to player
    behavior and auction dynamics based on the outcome of the specific auction identified
    by its ID.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object associated with the auction outcome.
      This parameter identifies which player's auction activity is being processed.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction that has completed. Used to locate
      and update the specific auction record in the system.
  - name: wasSuccessful
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the auction resulted in a successful
      transaction (true) or expired without sale (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionMgr->GetAuctionHouse(0);

      Player* player = ...; // Get player object

      uint32 auctionId = 12345;

      bool success = true;

      ah->LearnFromAuctionOutcome(&player, auctionId, success);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Auction Expiration
    code: 'AuctionHouse* ah = sAuctionMgr->GetAuctionHouse(0);

      Player* player = ...;

      uint32 auctionId = 12345;

      bool success = false; // Auction expired

      ah->LearnFromAuctionOutcome(&player, auctionId, success);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal statistics or machine learning models
    that help optimize future auction behavior. It may be used in conjunction with
    other auction house methods to maintain dynamic pricing or inventory management
    strategies.
  warnings: The player parameter should not be null, as it's used to identify the
    auction participant and update their related data. Improper handling of the auctionId
    could lead to incorrect state updates or data corruption.
