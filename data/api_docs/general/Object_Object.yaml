documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Object instance with default values.
  description: The Object constructor initializes a new Object instance, setting up
    the basic structure and default properties for all objects in the game world.
    This method is called when creating new instances of Object class or its derived
    classes like Item, GameObject, Creature, etc. It establishes the fundamental framework
    for object behavior including setting up the object's GUID, type, and other essential
    properties. The constructor ensures that all objects start with consistent default
    values regardless of their specific type.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Construction
    code: 'Object* obj = new Object();

      // This creates a new object instance with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor is typically called by the game engine during object creation.
    It's important to note that this method is not meant to be called directly by
    developers in most cases, as it's usually invoked automatically when creating
    new instances of derived classes.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly for creating objects; instead,
    use the appropriate factory methods or constructors from derived classes like
    Item, Creature, etc. Calling this constructor directly may lead to undefined behavior.
