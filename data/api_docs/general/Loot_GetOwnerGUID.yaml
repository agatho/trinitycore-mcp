documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who owns the loot.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier of
    the player who has ownership of a specific loot object. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, loot objects are associated with players who have the right
    to loot items from creatures or containers. This GUID is essential for tracking
    which player can claim items from a particular loot instance and ensures proper
    item distribution according to game rules such as group looting or free-for-all
    looting. The method does not modify any internal state and simply returns the
    stored GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the GUID of the player
    who owns this loot. This GUID uniquely identifies the owner within the game world
    and can be used to retrieve the corresponding Player object or perform other operations
    related to that specific player.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Owner GUID for Loot
    code: "Loot* loot = ...; // Assume loot is initialized\nconst int& ownerGUID =\
      \ loot->GetOwnerGUID();\nif (ownerGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Process the owner GUID\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Loot owner GUID: %u\", ownerGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is typically zero if no player owns the loot, indicating
    that it may be available for group looting or has not yet been assigned to a specific
    player. This method is commonly used in loot distribution systems and should be
    called with care when dealing with temporary or unassigned loot objects.
  warnings: Ensure that the Loot object being queried is valid before calling this
    method, as accessing an invalid or deleted Loot object may result in undefined
    behavior. Also note that the GUID returned might be zero if the loot has not been
    assigned to a player yet.
