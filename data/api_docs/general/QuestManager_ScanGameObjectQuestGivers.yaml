  class: QuestManager
  method: ScanGameObjectQuestGivers
  signature: void QuestManager::ScanGameObjectQuestGivers()
documentation:
  brief: Scans all game objects in the world to identify those that can initiate quests
    for players.
  description: The ScanGameObjectQuestGivers method iterates through all active game
    objects within the TrinityCore world instance and identifies those that are capable
    of initiating or offering quests to players. This process typically involves checking
    if a game object has associated quest givers or quest start entries in its database
    records. The method is essential for maintaining up-to-date quest availability
    information and ensuring that players can interact with quest-giving objects correctly.
    It's commonly invoked during server startup, zone loading, or when new quest-related
    game objects are spawned into the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest system initialization
    code: "void InitializeQuestSystem()\n{\n    sQuestManager->ScanGameObjectQuestGivers();\n\
      \    // Quest givers are now properly registered\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or zone loading
    to ensure all quest-giving game objects are properly recognized. It may involve
    database queries and can be performance-intensive if the world contains many game
    objects. The scanning process updates internal data structures used by the quest
    system for player interaction.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper synchronization may lead
    to inconsistent quest state information. It should not be invoked during active
    gameplay sessions unless specifically required for dynamic quest content updates.
