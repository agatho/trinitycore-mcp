  method: ~GroupCoordination
  signature: void GroupCoordination::~GroupCoordination()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupCoordination object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the GroupCoordination class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when a GroupCoordination
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore,
    this class likely manages coordination data for groups of players, such as loot
    distribution settings, roles, or other group-related state information. The destructor
    may also handle cleanup of internal data structures or synchronization primitives
    used for coordinating group activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'GroupCoordination* coord = new GroupCoordination();

      // ... use the object ...

      delete coord; // This calls the destructor'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destructor
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    GroupCoordination coord;\n    // ... use the\
      \ object ...\n    // Destructor automatically called when coord goes out of\
      \ scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only on properly constructed GroupCoordination
    objects. It is important to ensure that no other threads are accessing the object
    during destruction, as this could lead to race conditions or undefined behavior.
    The destructor may perform cleanup operations that involve locking internal mutexes
    or releasing shared resources.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly on an object that has already been
    destroyed. Avoid calling it from multiple threads simultaneously without proper
    synchronization. Be aware that destructors in inheritance hierarchies should be
    declared virtual if they are intended to be called through base class pointers.
