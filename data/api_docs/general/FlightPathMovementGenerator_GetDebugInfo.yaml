  signature: std::string FlightPathMovementGenerator::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the flight path movement generator's current
    state
  description: The GetDebugInfo method provides detailed diagnostic information about
    the FlightPathMovementGenerator instance, including its current flight path progress,
    waypoints, and internal state variables. This method is primarily used for debugging
    purposes during development and testing of flight path behavior in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server implementation. The returned string contains formatted data
    that can help developers understand the movement generator's current execution
    context, such as the active waypoint index, total waypoints, and any pending or
    completed segments of the flight path.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing formatted debug information about the flight path
    movement generator's state, including current progress, waypoint details, and
    internal variables that track the movement execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: "void DebugFlightPath() {\n    FlightPathMovementGenerator* generator =\
      \ new FlightPathMovementGenerator();\n    std::string debugInfo = generator->GetDebugInfo();\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Flight Path Debug Info: %s\", debugInfo.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically only called in debug builds or when specific debugging
    flags are enabled. The returned information format may change between TrinityCore
    versions and should not be relied upon for production logic. The method does not
    modify any internal state of the movement generator.
  warnings: Do not use the return value for game logic decisions as it's intended
    purely for debugging purposes. The debug information might contain sensitive internal
    state details that could be useful for exploit analysis if exposed in production
    environments.
