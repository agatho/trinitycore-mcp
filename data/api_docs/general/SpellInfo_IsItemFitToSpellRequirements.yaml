  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsItemFitToSpellRequirements(const Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific item meets the requirements for a spell.
  description: This method checks if a given item satisfies all the requirements necessary
    for a spell to be cast. It evaluates the item's properties against the spell's
    requirements, including item type, quality, and other constraints. The method
    is commonly used in spell validation logic to ensure that players can properly
    use items when casting spells, particularly in scenarios involving consumable
    items or equipment requirements. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    game balance and preventing invalid spell usage.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A pointer to an Item object which represents the item being evaluated
      against the spell requirements. The item must be valid and not null.
  returns: Returns true if the item meets all the requirements for the spell, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the item can be used in the context of the spell's
    casting requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'SpellInfo* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);

      Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);

      bool result = spellInfo->IsItemFitToSpellRequirements(item);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs checks on item properties such as item type, quality,
    and other requirements. It is typically used in conjunction with other spell validation
    methods to ensure proper spell casting mechanics. The method may be called multiple
    times during spell processing, so performance considerations should be taken into
    account when implementing.
  warnings: The method requires that the item pointer be valid and not null; passing
    a null item will result in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, this method
    does not check for item cooldowns or usage restrictions beyond basic requirements.
