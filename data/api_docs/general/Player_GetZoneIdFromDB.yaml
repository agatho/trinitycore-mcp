  class: Player
  method: GetZoneIdFromDB
  signature: uint32 Player::GetZoneIdFromDB(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the zone ID associated with a player's GUID from the database.
  description: This method fetches the zone ID from the database using the provided
    player GUID. It is typically used to determine the current zone or area where
    a player resides, which is essential for various game mechanics such as quest
    tracking, area triggers, and zone-based gameplay. The method ensures that the
    zone information is correctly retrieved from the database, allowing for accurate
    zone identification during gameplay. This function is particularly useful when
    dealing with player data that needs to be synchronized with the database state.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player. This value is used to
      query the database for the corresponding zone ID.
  returns: Returns the zone ID associated with the player's GUID from the database.
    If no valid zone ID is found, it returns 0, indicating that the player is either
    in an invalid or unknown zone.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneIdFromDB(12345);\nif (zoneId > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Process the zone ID\n    printf(\"Player is in zone: %d\\n\", zoneId);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid zone ID\n    printf(\"Invalid zone ID returned\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method requires database access and may involve database queries, which
    could impact performance if used frequently. It is recommended to cache zone IDs
    where possible to avoid repeated database calls.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player GUID is valid and known
    to exist in the database. Using invalid GUIDs can result in incorrect zone ID
    retrieval or database errors. Additionally, this method does not validate whether
    the player is currently in a valid zone; it simply retrieves the zone ID from
    the database.
