  brief: Initializes the Experience system for a player character
  description: The Experience constructor initializes the experience tracking and
    progression mechanics for a player character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method sets up internal data structures and state variables required for
    managing player experience points, level progression, and related game mechanics
    such as talent point allocation and skill advancement. The initialization process
    typically occurs during player login or character creation, ensuring that all
    experience-related systems are properly configured before gameplay begins.

  - title: Basic Experience System Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->GetExperience()->Experience(); // Initializes experience system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during player session setup. Developers should not normally need to invoke this
    method directly unless implementing custom character creation or experience system
    modifications.
