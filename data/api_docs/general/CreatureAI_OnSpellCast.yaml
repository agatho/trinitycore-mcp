documentation:
  brief: Handles spell casting events for creatures within the AI system
  description: The OnSpellCast method is a virtual callback function in the CreatureAI
    class that is invoked when a creature begins casting a spell. This method allows
    custom AI behavior to be implemented during spell casting, such as modifying spell
    parameters, interrupting casts, or triggering additional actions. It serves as
    an extension point for developers to customize how creatures behave during spell
    casting sequences within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that typically represents the spell
      ID being cast by the creature. This value may be used to determine specific
      behavior based on the spell type.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OnSpellCast(const\
      \ int* spellId) override {\n        if (spellId && *spellId == 12345) {\n  \
      \          // Custom behavior for a specific spell\n            DoCast(SPELL_CUSTOM_EFFECT);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Spell Casting Logic
    code: "class AdvancedCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OnSpellCast(const\
      \ int* spellId) override {\n        if (!spellId) return;\n        \n      \
      \  switch (*spellId) {\n            case SPELL_FIREBALL:\n                //\
      \ Modify target or interrupt\n                if (me->GetVictim()) {\n     \
      \               me->GetVictim()->AddAura(SPELL_BURNING, me);\n             \
      \   }\n                break;\n            case SPELL_HEAL:\n              \
      \  // Heal self or nearby allies\n                DoCast(me, SPELL_HEALING_AURA);\n\
      \                break;\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called during the spell casting process and should not block
    execution for extended periods. The parameter passed to this function may be null
    or invalid, so proper validation is required. Implementations should avoid modifying
    creature state in ways that could cause instability or infinite loops.
  warnings: Do not call methods that modify the creature's spell queue or cast status
    directly from within OnSpellCast as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Always validate input parameters before using them.
