  class: RestorationHoTTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void RestorationHoTTracker::Update(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the restoration HoT tracker for the specified group.
  description: The Update method processes and refreshes the state of all active healing-over-time
    (HoT) effects within the specified group. This method is typically invoked during
    game ticks or when a new HoT effect is applied to ensure that all tracked healing
    effects are properly updated according to their duration, tick intervals, and
    remaining time. It handles the internal logic for managing HoT timers, applying
    healing ticks, and removing expired effects from tracking. The method operates
    on a per-group basis, allowing for efficient processing of multiple groups without
    unnecessary overhead.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier for which to update the restoration HoT tracker.
      This parameter determines which set of active HoT effects will be processed
      and updated during this call.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RestorationHoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.Update(1); // Updates the tracker for group 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Groups
    code: "RestorationHoTTracker tracker;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    tracker.Update(i);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain accurate
    tracking of HoT effects. The implementation assumes that all relevant group data
    is properly initialized and accessible before calling this method.
