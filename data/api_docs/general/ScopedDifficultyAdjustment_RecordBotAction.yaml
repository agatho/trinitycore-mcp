documentation:
  brief: Records a bot action with success status for difficulty adjustment tracking.
  description: The RecordBotAction method logs whether a bot action was successful
    or not within the scoped difficulty adjustment context. This functionality is
    typically used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments to track bot behavior
    and adjust game difficulty dynamically based on automated player actions. The
    method updates internal state variables that may influence future difficulty scaling
    decisions for bots. It does not require any specific preconditions but should
    be called after a bot action has been completed to ensure accurate tracking.

    code: 'ScopedDifficultyAdjustment adjustment;

      bool actionSuccess = true; // Simulate successful bot action

      adjustment.RecordBotAction(actionSuccess);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal counters or flags that determine
    how difficulty adjustments are applied to bots. It's important to call this method
    consistently after each bot action to maintain accurate tracking.
