    const
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a list of optimization suggestions based on machine
    learning performance tracking data.
  description: The GetOptimizationSuggestions method analyzes tracked performance
    metrics and machine learning model behavior to produce actionable recommendations
    for improving system efficiency. This method is typically used in conjunction
    with MLPerformanceTracker's data collection capabilities to provide insights into
    potential bottlenecks, resource usage patterns, or model tuning opportunities.
    The returned suggestions are formatted as human-readable strings that can be displayed
    to developers or integrated into automated optimization workflows. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing optimization recommendations. Each
    string represents a distinct suggestion based on performance analysis, such as
    'Consider reducing model inference frequency' or 'Increase memory allocation for
    batch processing'. The vector may be empty if no significant issues or opportunities
    are detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\n// ... populate tracker with data ...\n\
      std::vector<std::string> suggestions = tracker.GetOptimizationSuggestions();\n\
      for (const auto& suggestion : suggestions) {\n    std::cout << \"Suggestion:\
      \ \" << suggestion << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Logging
    code: "MLPerformanceTracker tracker;\n// ... collect performance data ...\nauto\
      \ suggestions = tracker.GetOptimizationSuggestions();\nif (!suggestions.empty())\
      \ {\n    for (const auto& suggestion : suggestions) {\n        LOG_INFO(\"ml\"\
      , \"Performance Optimization Suggestion: {}\", suggestion);\n    }\n} else {\n\
      \    LOG_INFO(\"ml\", \"No optimization suggestions available.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on historical performance data being properly recorded
    within the MLPerformanceTracker instance. It performs no I/O operations or external
    dependencies. The suggestions generated are based on heuristics and statistical
    analysis of tracked metrics, so results may vary depending on data quality and
    volume.
  warnings: The returned vector contains dynamically allocated strings that should
    not be modified directly. If performance tracking data is incomplete or stale,
    the optimization suggestions may be misleading or irrelevant. Always validate
    that sufficient data has been collected before calling this method.
