  method: GetSkillPermBonusByPos
  signature: uint16 Player::GetSkillPermBonusByPos(uint32 pos) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the permanent bonus value for a specific skill at the given position.
  description: This method returns the permanent skill bonus associated with a particular
    skill position, which is typically used to determine the base skill level or bonus
    applied to a player's skill. The method is commonly employed in skill-related
    calculations and game mechanics where skill bonuses are required. It operates
    on the player's skill data structure, specifically targeting the skill at the
    specified position within the player's skill list. The returned value represents
    the permanent bonus that can be added to the skill level during calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint16 value representing the permanent skill bonus for the specified
    skill position. This value typically indicates the base skill level or bonus applied
    to the skill, and may be zero if no permanent bonus exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint16 bonus = player->GetSkillPermBonusByPos(0);

      // Assuming pos 0 refers to the first skill

      // This returns the permanent bonus for that skill'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Player class and is used in conjunction with other
    skill-related methods. It should be used carefully as it may not always reflect
    the current skill level, but rather the permanent bonus applied to the skill.
    Performance considerations are minimal since this is a simple lookup operation.
  warnings: The method assumes that the player has skills defined at the specified
    position; otherwise, behavior may be undefined or result in invalid data. Ensure
    that the skill position is valid before calling this method.
