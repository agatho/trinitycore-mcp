  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: IsPathTooComplex
  signature: bool PathfindingUtils::IsPathTooComplex(const int & waypoints, float
    maxComplexity)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a path exceeds the maximum allowed complexity threshold.
  description: The IsPathTooComplex method evaluates whether a given path, represented
    by its number of waypoints, surpasses a specified maximum complexity value. This
    utility is commonly used in TrinityCore's pathfinding system to prevent excessively
    complex paths from being processed or executed, which could lead to performance
    degradation or instability. The method compares the actual waypoint count against
    the provided threshold and returns true if the path is considered too complex
    for safe handling.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: The number of waypoints in the path to be evaluated. Must be a non-negative
      integer representing the total number of points in the calculated path.
  - name: maxComplexity
    description: The maximum allowed complexity threshold for a path. This value defines
      the upper limit of acceptable waypoint counts; if the actual waypoints exceed
      this value, the method returns true.
  returns: Returns true if the number of waypoints exceeds the maximum allowed complexity,
    indicating that the path is too complex to be safely processed. Returns false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: bool isTooComplex = PathfindingUtils::IsPathTooComplex(150, 100); // Returns
      true since 150 > 100
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Path Check
    code: "int waypointCount = player->GetPath()->GetWaypointCount();\nif (PathfindingUtils::IsPathTooComplex(waypointCount,\
      \ 200)) {\n    // Handle overly complex path\n    LOG_ERROR(\"path\", \"Path\
      \ too complex: {} waypoints\", waypointCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used as a preprocessing step before path execution
    to avoid performance bottlenecks. It's recommended to tune the maxComplexity parameter
    based on server performance and target game mechanics. The implementation assumes
    that higher waypoint counts correlate with higher computational complexity.
  warnings: Ensure that maxComplexity values are set appropriately for your server
    environment; setting it too low may cause valid paths to be rejected, while setting
    it too high may allow inefficient paths to be processed.
