  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: AcceptSolution
  signature: bool RoleOptimizer::AcceptSolution(float currentScore, float newScore,
    float temperature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether to accept a new solution during role optimization based
    on simulated annealing criteria.
  description: The AcceptSolution method implements a decision mechanism used in the
    RoleOptimizer class, typically following principles of simulated annealing. It
    evaluates whether to accept a new solution (represented by newScore) over the
    current one (currentScore), considering a given temperature parameter that controls
    the probability of accepting worse solutions. This allows the optimization algorithm
    to escape local optima and potentially find better global solutions. The method
    is crucial for the role assignment logic in TrinityCore's AI systems, particularly
    when optimizing player roles within groups or raids.
  parameters:
  - name: currentScore
    description: The fitness score of the current solution being considered.
  - name: newScore
    description: The fitness score of the proposed new solution to evaluate.
  - name: temperature
    description: A control parameter that determines the probability of accepting
      worse solutions. Higher temperatures allow more exploration, lower temperatures
      favor exploitation.
  returns: Returns true if the new solution is accepted, false otherwise. Acceptance
    is determined probabilistically based on the difference between scores and the
    current temperature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in role optimization loop
    code: "float current = optimizer.GetCurrentScore();\nfloat proposed = optimizer.EvaluateNewSolution();\n\
      float temp = optimizer.GetTemperature();\nif (optimizer.AcceptSolution(current,\
      \ proposed, temp)) {\n    optimizer.SetCurrentSolution(proposed);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Simulated annealing acceptance with cooling schedule
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < maxIterations; ++i) {\n    float currentScore = roleOptimizer.GetCurrentScore();\n\
      \    float newScore = roleOptimizer.ProposeNewSolution();\n    float temperature\
      \ = initialTemp * std::pow(coolingRate, i);\n    if (roleOptimizer.AcceptSolution(currentScore,\
      \ newScore, temperature)) {\n        roleOptimizer.UpdateCurrentSolution(newScore);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'This method is part of a probabilistic optimization strategy that mimics
    physical annealing processes. The acceptance probability follows the formula:
    P = exp(-(newScore - currentScore) / temperature). It''s important to ensure that
    temperature decreases appropriately over time for convergence.'
  warnings: Incorrect implementation of the acceptance criteria can lead to premature
    convergence or excessive exploration, both of which may degrade optimization performance.
    Ensure that temperature values are positive and properly scaled with respect to
    score differences.
