  class: GroupFormation
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: FormationMetrics GroupFormation::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves formation metrics for the group, including positioning and alignment
    data.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a FormationMetrics structure containing
    detailed information about the current group formation. This includes positional
    data of group members relative to the leader, alignment metrics, and other relevant
    formation statistics used for AI behavior and player coordination in group scenarios.
    The returned data is typically used by the game engine to manage group positioning
    during combat, movement, or quest-related activities where coordinated group behavior
    is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FormationMetrics object containing structured data about the group's
    current formation state, including member positions, alignment values, and other
    relevant metrics that define how the group is currently arranged.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupFormation* formation = player->GetGroup()->GetFormation();

      FormationMetrics metrics = formation->GetMetrics();

      printf("Leader Position: (%f, %f, %f)\n", metrics.leaderPosition.x, metrics.leaderPosition.y,
      metrics.leaderPosition.z);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group update cycles or when formation
    changes occur. The returned metrics are computed based on the current state of
    all group members and may be cached for performance reasons.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned FormationMetrics object directly as it may
    cause inconsistencies in the group's actual formation state. Always use appropriate
    setter methods to change formation parameters.
