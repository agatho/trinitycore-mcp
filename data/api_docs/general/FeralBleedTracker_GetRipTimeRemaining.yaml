  method: GetRipTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 FeralBleedTracker::GetRipTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the time remaining for a Rip effect on a target identified by GUID.
  description: The GetRipTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left for the
    Rip ability applied to a specific target. This method is typically used in feral
    druid combat logic to determine how much time remains before the Rip effect expires.
    The method takes a GUID parameter that identifies the target and returns the remaining
    time in milliseconds. If no Rip effect is active on the target, the method may
    return 0 or a default value indicating no active effect.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to check for Rip
      effect duration. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  returns: Returns the time remaining for the Rip effect in milliseconds. A return
    value of 0 indicates that no Rip effect is currently active on the target.
  examples:
  - title: Check Rip Duration on Target
    code: "uint32 ripTime = feralBleedTracker->GetRipTimeRemaining(targetGuid);\n\
      if (ripTime > 0)\n{\n    // Rip is active, continue with logic\n    uint32 secondsRemaining\
      \ = ripTime / 1000;\n    // Use secondsRemaining for UI or AI decisions\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal tracking data structures that store
    active effects and their durations. It is important to ensure that the GUID provided
    corresponds to a valid unit in the current game context to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: The method assumes that the GUID parameter refers to a valid target that
    can have Rip applied. Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in incorrect
    return values or undefined behavior. Always validate the GUID before calling this
    method if the target's existence is uncertain.
