  class: BotScheduler
  method: GetScheduledBots
  signature: int BotScheduler::GetScheduledBots() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total count of bots scheduled for execution by the bot scheduler.
  description: The GetScheduledBots method returns an integer value representing the
    number of bots currently scheduled for execution within the bot scheduler system.
    This count includes all bots that have been added to the scheduler's queue but
    have not yet been processed or executed. The method provides a snapshot of the
    current scheduling load and can be used by external systems to monitor bot activity,
    manage resources, or determine when new bots should be scheduled. The returned
    value is typically used for debugging, monitoring, or administrative purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of bots currently scheduled for
    execution. A return value of zero indicates no bots are scheduled, while positive
    values indicate the count of scheduled bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Scheduled Bot Count
    code: "int scheduledCount = scheduler.GetScheduledBots();\nif (scheduledCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << scheduledCount << \" bots scheduled\
      \ for execution.\\n\";\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No bots are currently scheduled.\\\
      n\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a read-only snapshot of the current scheduling state
    and does not modify any internal data structures. It is safe to call from multiple
    threads, but the returned value may change immediately after the call if other
    threads are adding or removing bots from the scheduler.
