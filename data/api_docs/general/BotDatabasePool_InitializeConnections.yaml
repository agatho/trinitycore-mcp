documentation:
  brief: Initializes database connections for the bot system
  description: The InitializeConnections method establishes and configures all necessary
    database connections required by the BotDatabasePool class. This method is responsible
    for setting up the connection pool that allows the bot system to interact with
    the TrinityCore database, enabling operations such as loading bot configurations,
    saving bot states, and managing bot-related data. The method typically performs
    connection validation and error handling to ensure reliable database access throughout
    the bot's lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all database connections were successfully initialized
    and configured; returns false if any connection failed to establish or configure
    properly.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotDatabasePool* pool = new BotDatabasePool();\nif (pool->InitializeConnections())\
      \ {\n    // Database connections established successfully\n    printf(\"Bot\
      \ database connections initialized successfully.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ initialization failure\n    printf(\"Failed to initialize bot database connections.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the server startup process
    or when initializing the bot subsystem. The method may block until all connections
    are established, so it's recommended to call it asynchronously if possible in
    performance-critical scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    resource leaks or connection pool corruption. Ensure that any existing connections
    are properly closed before reinitializing.
