  signature: void TradeSystem::GenerateTradeRecommendation(Player * player, uint32
    sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a trade recommendation for the specified player based on their
    current inventory and market conditions.
  description: The GenerateTradeRecommendation method analyzes a player's inventory,
    item values, and current market trends to produce an optimized trade suggestion.
    This functionality is typically used within the trading system to assist players
    in making informed decisions about which items to trade or sell. The method evaluates
    item rarity, vendor prices, auction house data, and player-specific factors such
    as skill levels and inventory space. It requires a valid player object and session
    ID to ensure proper context for recommendation generation. The generated recommendations
    are usually stored internally or sent directly to the client for display.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the trade recommendation is
      being generated. Must be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: sessionId
    description: Unique identifier for the current trading session. Used to track
      and correlate recommendations with specific trading interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Recommendation Generation
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Valid player object

      uint32 sessionId = 12345;

      TradeSystem::GenerateTradeRecommendation(player, sessionId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Trading UI
    code: "void HandlePlayerTradeRequest(Player* player) {\n    uint32 sessionId =\
      \ sTradeMgr->GetActiveSessionId(player);\n    if (sessionId != 0) {\n      \
      \  TradeSystem::GenerateTradeRecommendation(player, sessionId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs intensive computations involving item database
    lookups and market analysis. It should be called asynchronously or during idle
    periods to avoid client lag. The actual recommendation logic may depend on external
    data sources like auction house databases, vendor price lists, and player skill
    modifiers.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid session ID may result in undefined behavior or failed
    recommendation generation. This method might be computationally expensive if processing
    large inventories.
