documentation:
  brief: Handles the bot's respawn logic when it dies and returns to the game world.
  description: The OnRespawn method is invoked when a bot character respawns after
    death, typically triggered by the game's respawn system. This method manages the
    bot's state restoration, including resetting health, mana, and other relevant
    attributes. It may also handle reinitialization of AI behavior or quest-related
    states. The method ensures that the bot is properly reintegrated into the game
    world with appropriate starting conditions. This function is part of the BotLifecycle
    class which governs the overall life cycle management of bot characters within
    TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic respawn handling
    code: "void MyBot::OnRespawn()\n{\n    // Reset bot's health and mana\n    SetHealth(GetMaxHealth());\n\
      \    SetMana(GetMaxMana());\n    \n    // Reinitialize AI behavior\n    InitializeAI();\n\
      \    \n    // Log respawn event\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %u has respawned.\"\
      , GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during the bot's respawn process. Developers should ensure that any custom logic
    in this method does not interfere with core respawn mechanics or cause infinite
    loops. The method may be invoked multiple times during a bot's lifetime, particularly
    if the bot dies and respawns repeatedly.
  warnings: Avoid performing heavy operations or blocking calls within this method
    as it may impact game performance. Do not call this method directly unless you
    understand the implications of bypassing the normal respawn flow.
