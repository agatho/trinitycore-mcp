  class: WaypointMovementGenerator
  method: DoInitialize
  signature: void WaypointMovementGenerator::DoInitialize(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the waypoint movement generator for a creature, setting up its
    movement path and starting position.
  description: The DoInitialize method prepares a Creature's waypoint movement behavior
    by configuring the initial state of the movement generator. This includes setting
    up internal data structures such as the current waypoint index, movement speed,
    and activation status. It is typically called when a creature begins following
    a predefined path defined by waypoints in the database. The method ensures that
    the creature starts at the correct location on its path and initializes necessary
    flags for movement execution. This initialization step is crucial for proper waypoint-based
    AI behavior in TrinityCore's creature AI system.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will be initialized with waypoint
      movement behavior. This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid
      creature instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initializing a creature's waypoint movement
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // Assume this is a valid creature

      WaypointMovementGenerator* wpGen = new WaypointMovementGenerator();

      wpGen->DoInitialize(myCreature);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a creature's movement. It is typically invoked internally by the AI system when
    a creature is assigned waypoint-based movement. The method does not directly start
    movement execution; it merely prepares the internal state for later movement processing.
  warnings: Do not call this method on a creature that is already in active movement,
    as it may cause undefined behavior or conflicts with existing movement states.
    Ensure that the creature has valid waypoint data before calling this method.
