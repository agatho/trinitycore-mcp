  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: CreateGuildEvent
  signature: uint32 GuildEventCoordinator::CreateGuildEvent(int * organizer, const
    GuildEvent & eventData)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new guild event with the specified organizer and event data, returning
    the unique identifier of the created event.
  description: The CreateGuildEvent method is responsible for initializing and storing
    a new guild event within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an organizer reference
    (likely a player GUID) and event data structure to construct the event. The method
    assigns a unique identifier to the newly created event, which can be used for
    subsequent operations such as retrieving, modifying, or deleting the event. This
    functionality is integral to the guild management system in World of Warcraft,
    allowing guild leaders and officers to schedule events like raids, social gatherings,
    or guild meetings. The method ensures that all necessary validations are performed
    on the input data before creation, and it integrates with the existing guild event
    coordination infrastructure.
  parameters:
  - name: organizer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the player who is
      organizing the guild event. This value should correspond to a valid player in
      the game world.
  - name: eventData
    description: Reference to a GuildEvent structure containing all the details about
      the event such as title, description, type, date/time, and other relevant metadata.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier (ID) assigned
    to the newly created guild event. A return value of 0 typically indicates failure
    in creating the event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Event Creation
    code: "int organizerGuid = 12345;\nGuildEvent event;\nevent.title = \"Weekly Raid\"\
      ;\nevent.description = \"Normal raid for weekly content\";\nevent.type = GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_RAID;\n\
      event.date = time(nullptr) + 3600; // One hour from now\nuint32 eventId = guildEventCoordinator->CreateGuildEvent(&organizerGuid,\
      \ event);\nif (eventId != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Guild event created with ID: %u\\\
      n\", eventId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Guild Social Event
    code: "#include <time.h>\nint organizerGuid = 54321;\nGuildEvent socialEvent;\n\
      socialEvent.title = \"Guild Dinner\";\nsocialEvent.description = \"Join us for\
      \ dinner at the guild hall\";\nsocialEvent.type = GUILD_EVENT_TYPE_SOCIAL;\n\
      socialEvent.date = time(nullptr) + 86400; // Tomorrow\nuint32 eventId = guildEventCoordinator->CreateGuildEvent(&organizerGuid,\
      \ socialEvent);\nif (eventId != 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Social event scheduled with\
      \ ID: %u\\n\", eventId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"Failed to create guild event.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures and databases
    to persist the event information. It may perform checks for organizer permissions,
    validate event dates, and ensure that duplicate events are not created. The returned
    ID can be used in other GuildEventCoordinator methods such as GetGuildEvent or
    UpdateGuildEvent.
  warnings: Ensure that the organizer GUID points to a valid player who is part of
    the guild; otherwise, the method might fail or create an invalid event. Also,
    make sure that the event data passed in is properly initialized and contains valid
    values for all required fields.
