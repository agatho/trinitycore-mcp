  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: GetRequiredReagents
  signature: int VendorInteractionManager::GetRequiredReagents() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the total number of required reagents for a vendor transaction
  description: The GetRequiredReagents method returns an integer value representing
    the count of reagent items required to purchase an item from a vendor. This method
    is typically used in the context of vendor interactions within World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, where players must provide specific materials or resources
    to acquire certain goods. The returned value indicates how many reagent items
    are needed for the transaction, which may vary depending on the item being purchased
    and the player's current inventory state. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of required reagents for the vendor
    transaction. Returns 0 if no reagents are required or if the transaction context
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int reagentCount = vendorManager.GetRequiredReagents();\nif (reagentCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"This item requires %d reagents to purchase.\\n\", reagentCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger vendor interaction system and may
    depend on the current item being queried. The implementation should be thread-safe
    as it's typically called during player interaction events.
  warnings: Ensure that the VendorInteractionManager instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid object
    may result in undefined behavior.
