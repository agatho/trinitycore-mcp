documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AchievementGlobalMgr class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the AchievementGlobalMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is used to access the global achievement management system
    that handles tracking, validation, and reward distribution for player achievements.
    The returned pointer provides access to all achievement-related functionality
    including achievement criteria checking, progress updates, and reward granting.
    This method is thread-safe and should be used whenever achievement-related operations
    are required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of AchievementGlobalMgr. The method
    never returns NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to exist during the application
    runtime.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Global Achievement Manager
    code: 'AchievementGlobalMgr* mgr = AchievementGlobalMgr::Instance();

      // Use mgr to access achievement functionality

      mgr->CheckAchievementCriteria(player, criteriaId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance for Achievement Validation
    code: "void OnPlayerKill(Player* player, Unit* victim) {\n    AchievementGlobalMgr*\
      \ mgr = AchievementGlobalMgr::Instance();\n    if (mgr) {\n        mgr->CheckAchievementCriteria(player,\
      \ ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_TYPE_KILL_CREATURE);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The AchievementGlobalMgr instance is created on first access and persists for
    the entire application lifetime. The implementation is thread-safe and designed
    to be called from multiple threads without synchronization overhead.
