documentation:
  brief: Checks whether line-of-sight blocking is disabled for this game object model
  description: This method determines if the GameObjectModel has its line-of-sight
    blocking behavior disabled. When LOS blocking is disabled, the game object will
    not block visibility or projectile paths between other objects in the world. This
    is commonly used for decorative or non-physical objects that should not obstruct
    the game environment's visual or mechanical flow. The method returns a boolean
    value indicating the current state of this flag.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if line-of-sight blocking is disabled for this GameObjectModel, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Check if LOS blocking is disabled before casting spell
    code: "if (gameObjectModel->IsLosBlockingDisabled()) {\n    // Handle special\
      \ case where object doesn't block LOS\n    // This might affect spell targeting\
      \ or visibility checks\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This flag is typically set during GameObject creation or through specific
    game mechanics. It's important to understand that disabling LOS blocking does
    not make the object invisible, but rather allows projectiles and line-of-sight
    calculations to pass through it as if it were not there.
