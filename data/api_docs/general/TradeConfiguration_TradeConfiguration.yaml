documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new TradeConfiguration object with default settings.
  description: The TradeConfiguration constructor initializes a new instance of the
    TradeConfiguration class, setting up default trade parameters and configuration
    values. This method is typically called when creating a new trade configuration
    object to manage player trading behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The
    initialization process ensures that all internal trade-related variables are properly
    configured with sensible defaults, allowing for consistent trade operations across
    different game contexts. This constructor does not require any parameters and
    prepares the object for subsequent configuration or usage in trade-related systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new Trade Configuration
    code: 'TradeConfiguration config;

      // The config object is now initialized with default trade settings

      // Ready to be used for player trading operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the TradeConfiguration class and should only
    be called when creating new instances. The initialization process sets up internal
    data structures that are essential for trade functionality, including default
    trade limits, item restrictions, and other configuration parameters.
