  class: HunterAI
  method: HandlePetManagement
  signature: bool HunterAI::HandlePetManagement(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages pet behavior and actions for the hunter AI, returning true if management
    was successful.
  description: The HandlePetManagement method is responsible for controlling and managing
    the behavior of a hunter's pet within the TrinityCore AI system. It evaluates
    the current state of the pet and the hunter's target to determine appropriate
    actions such as attacking, following, or staying in place. This method integrates
    with the broader AI decision-making process to ensure that the pet acts in accordance
    with the hunter's intentions and game mechanics. The method typically checks if
    a valid target exists and whether the pet should engage in combat or remain passive
    based on various conditions including pet health, distance to target, and threat
    level.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID or index. This parameter
      is used to determine which entity the pet should focus on or attack. A value
      of -1 typically indicates no valid target.
  returns: Returns true if the pet management was handled successfully and the pet's
    behavior was updated accordingly; otherwise returns false if there was an error
    or no action was taken.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Management Call
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nbool result = hunterAI->HandlePetManagement(&targetId);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Pet management completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Pet Management with No Target
    code: "int targetId = -1;\nbool result = hunterAI->HandlePetManagement(&targetId);\n\
      if (!result)\n{\n    // No valid target, pet remains passive\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and relies on
    the hunter's current target state. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific type of pet controlled by the hunter (e.g., wolf, cat, bird). Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary checks when no valid target exists.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. Incorrect handling of the target ID can
    lead to unexpected pet behavior or AI errors.
