  signature: bool QuestEvent::IsExpired() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a quest event has expired based on its time constraints.
  description: The IsExpired method determines if a quest event has exceeded its valid
    time window. This is typically used to manage quest timers, dynamic events, or
    time-sensitive objectives within the World of Warcraft game world. The method
    evaluates internal time tracking mechanisms and returns true if the event's duration
    has elapsed, false otherwise. Quest events may have different expiration behaviors
    depending on their type, such as temporary world events, daily quests with time
    limits, or seasonal activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest event has expired (i.e., its time limit has passed),
    false if it is still active and valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Quest Event Status
    code: "if (questEvent->IsExpired()) {\n    // Handle expired quest event\n   \
      \ SendQuestFailedMessage(player, questId);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with normal\
      \ quest handling\n    HandleActiveQuestEvent(player, questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsExpired in Quest Update Logic
    code: "void UpdateQuestEvents(Player* player) {\n    for (auto& event : GetActiveQuestEvents())\
      \ {\n        if (event->IsExpired()) {\n            event->OnExpired(player);\n\
      \            RemoveEvent(event);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal time tracking and should be called frequently
    during quest update cycles. The expiration logic may vary based on the specific
    type of quest event, such as whether it's a timed daily quest or a permanent world
    event with fixed start/end times.
  warnings: Do not assume that an expired quest event will automatically remove itself
    from active lists; explicit cleanup logic should be implemented in conjunction
    with this check. Also, calling IsExpired on events without proper initialization
    may lead to undefined behavior.
