documentation:
  brief: Sets the turn-in strategy for a bot's quest completion behavior
  description: Configures how a bot should handle quest turn-ins by specifying a particular
    strategy. This method allows developers to define whether the bot should automatically
    turn in quests, delay turn-ins, or follow specific quest completion patterns.
    The strategy parameter determines the bot's behavior during quest completion events,
    which can affect quest progression and NPC interactions. This is typically used
    in AI scripting for automated quest management within TrinityCore-based World
    of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character that will use this
      turn-in strategy
  - name: strategy
    description: The turn-in strategy to apply, defining how the bot handles quest
      completion behavior
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Basic Turn-In Strategy for Bot
    code: 'QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      uint32 botGuid = 12345;

      TurnInStrategy strategy = TURN_IN_STRATEGY_IMMEDIATE;

      questTurnIn.SetTurnInStrategy(botGuid, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Bot with Delayed Turn-In Strategy
    code: 'QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      uint32 botGuid = 67890;

      TurnInStrategy strategy = TURN_IN_STRATEGY_DELAYED;

      questTurnIn.SetTurnInStrategy(botGuid, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with bot AI systems to control
    quest completion behavior. The actual implementation of TurnInStrategy values
    should be referenced from the TrinityCore source code or API documentation for
    valid enum values.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid corresponds to an active bot character, as using
    an invalid GUID may result in undefined behavior or failed strategy application.
