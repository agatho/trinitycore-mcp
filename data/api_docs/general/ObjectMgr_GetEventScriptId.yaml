  signature: uint32 ObjectMgr::GetEventScriptId(uint32 eventId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script identifier associated with a specified game event.
  description: The GetEventScriptId method retrieves the unique script identifier
    (ID) that is linked to a specific game event within the TrinityCore database.
    This function is typically used to determine which script should be executed when
    a particular event occurs, such as holiday celebrations or seasonal activities.
    The method performs a lookup in the internal event script mapping table and returns
    the corresponding script ID if found, otherwise it returns zero. It's commonly
    employed by the core's event handling system to trigger appropriate scripted behaviors
    during game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the script identifier associated with
    the specified event. If no script is registered for the given event ID, the method
    returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Script ID for Event
    code: "uint32 eventId = 1234;\nuint32 scriptId = sObjectMgr->GetEventScriptId(eventId);\n\
      if (scriptId != 0)\n{\n    // Use the script ID to trigger event-specific behavior\n\
      \    sGameEventMgr->StartEvent(eventId, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr class which manages various game objects
    and their associated data. The implementation likely involves a lookup table or
    database query to map event IDs to script IDs. It's important to note that this
    function should only be called after the event system has been initialized.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid event ID may return zero, which could
    be misinterpreted as a valid script ID. Always verify that the returned ID is
    non-zero before using it for script execution.
