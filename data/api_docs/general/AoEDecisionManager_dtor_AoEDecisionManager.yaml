documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AoEDecisionManager instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the AoEDecisionManager class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the manager.
    This method is automatically invoked when an instance of AoEDecisionManager goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures proper resource deallocation
    to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability during AI decision-making
    processes involving area-of-effect abilities in World of Warcraft. The destructor
    typically handles cleanup of internal data structures, cached decisions, and any
    temporary allocations used by the manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope exit
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    AoEDecisionManager manager;\n    // ... use\
      \ manager ...\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of heap-allocated instance
    code: 'AoEDecisionManager* manager = new AoEDecisionManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only on properly constructed instances. It's
    important to note that this is a virtual destructor, meaning if the class has
    derived classes, the correct destructors will be called in the inheritance hierarchy.
    The implementation likely handles cleanup of internal decision caches and temporary
    data structures used for AoE targeting decisions.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects as it's
    automatically invoked. Avoid calling delete on a pointer that has already been
    deleted, which could lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all references to the
    manager are cleared before destruction to prevent dangling pointers.
