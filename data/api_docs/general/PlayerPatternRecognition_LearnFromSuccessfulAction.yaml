  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: LearnFromSuccessfulAction
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::LearnFromSuccessfulAction(Player * player,
    const std::string & action, float effectiveness)
documentation:
  brief: Updates player pattern recognition data based on a successful action and
    its effectiveness.
  description: The LearnFromSuccessfulAction method is used to enhance a player's
    pattern recognition capabilities within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a
    reference to a Player object, the name of an action performed successfully, and
    a float value representing how effective that action was. This method likely updates
    internal learning mechanisms or skill progression related to pattern recognition
    for the specified player. The effectiveness parameter may influence how much the
    player's recognition ability improves or how quickly they learn from the action.
    This functionality is typically part of a larger system that tracks player behavior
    and adapts their skills accordingly, possibly used in crafting, combat, or quest
    systems where recognizing patterns leads to improved performance.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose pattern recognition data will
      be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: action
    description: A string identifier representing the successful action performed
      by the player. This could be a skill name, spell ID, or other recognizable action
      type.
  - name: effectiveness
    description: A floating-point value indicating how effective the action was (typically
      between 0.0 and 1.0). Higher values may result in greater learning gains.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LearnFromSuccessfulAction
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      std::string actionName = "Fireball Spell";

      float effectiveness = 0.85f;

      player->GetPatternRecognition()->LearnFromSuccessfulAction(player, actionName,
      effectiveness);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal player skill or learning systems
    and may trigger updates to the player's pattern recognition progress or related
    statistics. It should be called only when a successful action has occurred, as
    it is designed for learning purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Passing invalid data could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the TrinityCore server.
