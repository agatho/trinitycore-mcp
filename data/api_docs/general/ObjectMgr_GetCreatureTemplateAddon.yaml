documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the addon data for a creature template by its entry ID
  description: The GetCreatureTemplateAddon method fetches the addon data associated
    with a specific creature template entry. This addon data typically contains additional
    configuration values such as movement patterns, combat behavior, or AI-related
    settings that are not part of the base creature template. The returned pointer
    points to an array of integers representing these addon properties. If no addon
    data exists for the specified entry, the method may return NULL or a default set
    of values depending on internal implementation. This method is commonly used during
    creature instantiation and AI behavior initialization in TrinityCore's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the addon data for
    the creature template, or NULL if no addon data exists for the specified entry
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use creature addon data
    code: "const int* addonData = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureTemplateAddon(12345);\nif\
      \ (addonData != nullptr)\n{\n    // Access addon values\n    int movementType\
      \ = addonData[0];\n    int combatBehavior = addonData[1];\n    // Use the data\
      \ for custom logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal object manager caches and should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections. The returned pointer is valid only while the
    ObjectMgr instance remains alive and should not be stored or dereferenced after
    cache invalidation.
  warnings: The returned integer array may contain uninitialized values if no addon
    data was loaded for the entry. Always check for NULL before accessing the returned
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults.
