documentation:
  brief: Executes utility abilities for the evoker AI, selecting and casting appropriate
    spells based on combat state and resource management.
  description: The UseUtilityAbilities method is responsible for managing the casting
    of utility spells within the EvokerAI class. This method evaluates the current
    combat situation, available mana, and spell cooldowns to determine which utility
    abilities should be cast. It typically handles defensive spells, healing abilities,
    or other supportive actions that enhance the evoker's survivability or effectiveness
    in battle. The method is called during the AI update cycle and integrates with
    the overall decision-making process of the evoker's behavior.

  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    UseUtilityAbilities();\n\n    // Other AI logic...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI update cycle and should not
    be called directly from outside the AI framework. It relies on internal state
    tracking of mana, cooldowns, and combat conditions to make intelligent spell selection
    decisions.
