  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteWarriorInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteWarriorInterrupt(BotAI * ai,
    ::Unit * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Interrupts a target unit's spell casting if the bot is a warrior and the
    spell can be interrupted.
  description: The ExecuteWarriorInterrupt method is designed to handle spell interruption
    logic specifically for warrior bots within the TrinityCore AI framework. It evaluates
    whether the current bot, identified as a warrior, should attempt to interrupt
    an ongoing spell cast by a target unit. This action typically involves checking
    if the warrior has the appropriate ability (like Spell Reflection or Shield Slam)
    and if the target's spell is interruptible. The method returns an ActionResult
    indicating success or failure of the interruption attempt. It is part of the broader
    spell interruption system used in bot AI behavior for managing combat interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the warrior bot. Used to
      access AI state and capabilities.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target whose spell casting
      is being interrupted.
  - name: spellId
    description: The identifier of the spell that is being interrupted. Used to determine
      if the spell can be interrupted by a warrior.
  returns: ActionResult indicating whether the interruption was successful (e.g.,
    SUCCESS, FAILED, or PENDING). The specific values depend on the implementation
    of the ActionResult enum in the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Warrior Interrupt Usage
    code: "if (SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteWarriorInterrupt(ai, target, spellId)\
      \ == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \    ai->GetBot()->SetTarget(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Warrior Interrupt Based on Spell Type
    code: "if (spellId == 12345 && SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteWarriorInterrupt(ai,\
      \ target, spellId) == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\n{\n    ai->GetBot()->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 98765, true); // Cast a counter spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot is already in combat and has the necessary
    warrior abilities to interrupt spells. It does not perform checks for line of
    sight or range to the target unit; those should be handled before calling this
    method. The method may return PENDING if the interruption requires a delay or
    animation.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId passed is valid and corresponds to an actual spell
    in the game database, otherwise the behavior may be undefined. Do not call this
    method outside of combat context without proper validation as it might lead to
    unexpected AI behavior.
