  signature: bool LFGRoleDetector::ClassCanTank(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified player class is capable of assuming the tank
    role in LFG situations.
  description: The ClassCanTank method evaluates whether a given player class has
    the inherent ability to fulfill a tanking role within World of Warcraft's Looking
    for Group (LFG) system. This determination is based on class-specific mechanics
    and game design that define which classes are considered viable tank options.
    The method returns true if the class can effectively serve as a tank, and false
    otherwise. It is typically used during LFG matchmaking to filter eligible players
    based on their class capabilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player class is capable of assuming a tank
    role; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Warrior Class Can Tank
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector detector;

      bool canTank = detector.ClassCanTank(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns true as Warriors are valid tank classes'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses hardcoded class mappings or a lookup table to determine
    tank eligibility. It may be used internally by the LFG system to validate role
    assignments and ensure proper group composition.
