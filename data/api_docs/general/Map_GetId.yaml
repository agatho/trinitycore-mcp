  signature: uint32 Map::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the map instance.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique identifier associated with a
    specific map instance within the TrinityCore framework. This identifier is crucial
    for distinguishing between different maps in the game world, as each map has its
    own distinct ID. The method is commonly used when working with map-related operations,
    such as identifying which map a player is currently in or retrieving map-specific
    data. It serves as a fundamental building block for various game mechanics and
    system operations that require map identification.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 identifier of the map instance, which uniquely identifies
    the map within the game world. This ID corresponds to the map's database entry
    and is used for various internal operations including but not limited to player
    movement, zone-based interactions, and map-specific logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = player->GetMap();

      uint32 mapId = map->GetId();

      // mapId now contains the unique identifier of the current map'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance-wise,
    it's a very fast operation as it simply returns a stored value without any complex
    computations or database queries.
  warnings: No significant warnings. The method should not be used in contexts where
    the map instance might be null or invalid, though this is generally not an issue
    in normal gameplay.
