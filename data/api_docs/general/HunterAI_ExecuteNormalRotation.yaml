  class: HunterAI
  method: ExecuteNormalRotation
  signature: void HunterAI::ExecuteNormalRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the hunter's normal combat rotation logic, determining and applying
    appropriate abilities based on target and current game state.
  description: The ExecuteNormalRotation method is responsible for implementing the
    core decision-making logic of a hunter's AI during regular combat. It evaluates
    the current target, available abilities, mana levels, and other relevant factors
    to determine which spells or abilities should be cast next in order to maximize
    damage output or survival. This method typically handles the execution of auto-attacks,
    ranged attacks, and ability usage within the context of a standard hunter rotation.
    The method may also consider cooldowns, resource management, and tactical positioning
    when making decisions. It is generally called during the AI update cycle and can
    modify the hunter's behavior dynamically based on changing battlefield conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target ID or index for the
      current combat target. This value may be used to retrieve or validate the target
      object before executing rotation logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    int targetId = GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    ExecuteNormalRotation(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should only be called when the
    hunter has an active combat target. The method assumes that the target pointer
    is valid and that the hunter's state is properly initialized for combat actions.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect AI decisions. Ensure that the target ID is valid before calling this
    method, especially in scenarios involving multiple targets or dynamic targeting.
