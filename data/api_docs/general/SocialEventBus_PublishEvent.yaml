  class: SocialEventBus
  method: PublishEvent
  signature: bool SocialEventBus::PublishEvent(const SocialEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a social event to all registered listeners in the social event
    bus.
  description: The PublishEvent method dispatches a given SocialEvent to all subscribers
    of the social event bus. This mechanism allows various subsystems within TrinityCore
    to communicate social-related events such as player interactions, guild activities,
    or group actions without tight coupling. The method returns true if the event
    was successfully published to at least one listener, and false if no listeners
    were registered to receive the event. This function is typically used in conjunction
    with SubscribeEvent to implement a publish-subscribe pattern for social game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The SocialEvent object containing the event data to be published.
      This object must be properly initialized with valid event type and associated
      data before being passed to this method.
  returns: True if the event was successfully published to at least one registered
    listener; false if no listeners were available to receive the event.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Publishing
    code: "SocialEvent event;\nevent.Type = SOCIAL_EVENT_GUILD_CHAT;\nevent.Data =\
      \ \"Hello everyone!\";\nbool result = socialEventBus.PublishEvent(event);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Event was published successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Publishing Player Join Event
    code: "SocialEvent joinEvent;\njoinEvent.Type = SOCIAL_EVENT_PLAYER_JOIN;\njoinEvent.Data\
      \ = \"Player joined the group\";\njoinEvent.SenderGuid = player->GetGUID();\n\
      bool success = socialEventBus.PublishEvent(joinEvent);\nif (!success)\n{\n \
      \   // No listeners were registered for this event type\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread
    context. The event bus maintains a list of registered subscribers, and each subscriber
    will receive the event in the order they were registered. Performance considerations
    include avoiding frequent publishing of large events or events with high frequency,
    as this may impact overall system responsiveness.
  warnings: Ensure that the SocialEvent object passed to this method is fully initialized
    before calling PublishEvent, as invalid or incomplete data may lead to unexpected
    behavior in subscribers. Also, be cautious about publishing events too frequently,
    which could cause performance degradation in high-traffic scenarios.
