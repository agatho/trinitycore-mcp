  signature: uint32 GameObjectTemplate::GetLootId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the loot entry ID associated with this game object template.
  description: The GetLootId method retrieves the unique identifier that links this
    GameObjectTemplate to a specific loot template in the database. This ID is used
    by the game's loot system to determine which items should be dropped when the
    game object is interacted with or destroyed. The returned value typically corresponds
    to an entry in the gameobject_loot_template table, which defines the possible
    loot items and their drop chances for this particular type of game object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the loot template ID associated with this game
    object. If no loot is defined for this object, the method returns 0, indicating
    that the object does not have any loot entries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Loot Availability
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(179564);\n\
      if (goTemplate->GetLootId() > 0)\n{\n    // This game object has loot defined\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Game object %u has loot ID: %u\", goTemplate->entry,\
      \ goTemplate->GetLootId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Loot ID to Retrieve Loot Template
    code: "uint32 lootId = goTemplate->GetLootId();\nif (lootId > 0)\n{\n    LootTemplates_Gameobject\
      \ const* lootTemplate = sLootMgr->GetLootTemplateForGameobject(lootId);\n  \
      \  if (lootTemplate)\n    {\n        // Process the loot template for this game\
      \ object\n        sLog->outString(\"Retrieved loot template for game object\
      \ with ID: %u\", lootId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in loot-related systems and during game object
    initialization. The returned loot ID should be validated against the database
    to ensure it corresponds to an existing loot template entry. Performance-wise,
    this is a simple getter method with constant time complexity.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned ID directly without verifying its
    existence in the database. An invalid or non-existent loot ID may lead to undefined
    behavior or missing loot drops. Always validate that the loot template exists
    before attempting to use it.
