  class: InteractionManager
  method: GetPerformanceMetrics
  signature: void InteractionManager::GetPerformanceMetrics(uint32 & successCount,
    uint32 & failCount, uint32 & avgTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves performance metrics for interaction operations including success
    count, failure count, and average execution time.
  description: 'The GetPerformanceMetrics method collects and returns statistical
    data about interaction operations handled by the InteractionManager. It provides
    three key metrics: the total number of successful interactions, the total number
    of failed interactions, and the average time taken to complete each interaction.
    This method is typically used for monitoring system performance, debugging interaction-related
    issues, or generating reports on interaction efficiency. The values are populated
    into the provided reference parameters, which must be valid uint32 variables.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from multiple
    threads concurrently.'
  parameters:
  - name: successCount
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the total
      number of successful interaction operations.
  - name: failCount
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the total
      number of failed interaction operations.
  - name: avgTime
    description: Reference to a uint32 variable that will be filled with the average
      execution time (in milliseconds) for all interaction operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 successes = 0;

      uint32 failures = 0;

      uint32 averageTime = 0;

      interactionManager.GetPerformanceMetrics(successes, failures, averageTime);

      std::cout << "Successes: " << successes << ", Failures: " << failures << ",
      Avg Time: " << averageTime << "ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void LogInteractionStats() {\n    uint32 successCount = 0;\n    uint32\
      \ failCount = 0;\n    uint32 avgTime = 0;\n    \n    interactionManager.GetPerformanceMetrics(successCount,\
      \ failCount, avgTime);\n    \n    if (successCount + failCount > 0) {\n    \
      \    float successRate = (float)successCount / (successCount + failCount) *\
      \ 100.0f;\n        sLog->outString(\"Interaction Stats - Success Rate: %.2f%%,\
      \ Avg Time: %ums\", successRate, avgTime);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and should not cause performance
    degradation. The metrics are updated incrementally as interactions occur, making
    this method suitable for periodic monitoring without significant overhead. The
    values returned are cumulative since the manager was initialized or last reset.
  warnings: Ensure that the reference parameters passed to this method are properly
    initialized before calling to avoid undefined behavior. While the method itself
    is thread-safe, if other threads are modifying interaction statistics concurrently,
    results may vary between calls.
