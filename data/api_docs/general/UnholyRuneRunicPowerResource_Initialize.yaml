  class: UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the unholy rune runic power resource for a player bot.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal state and configuration
    of the UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource class for a specified player bot. This includes
    initializing rune-related data structures, setting up resource tracking mechanisms,
    and preparing the system to manage runic power generation and consumption specific
    to the unholy death knight specialization. The method ensures that all necessary
    game mechanics are properly configured before the bot begins utilizing unholy
    rune abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      unholy rune runic power resources. Must be a valid player instance with death
      knight class and unholy specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot

      UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource resource;

      resource.Initialize(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a death knight bot. It assumes that the player object is already properly configured
    with valid class and specialization data. The initialization process may involve
    setting up internal timers, rune cooldown tracking, and resource management systems
    specific to unholy death knights.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized Player object will
    likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter
    is a fully constructed Player instance with proper class data before calling Initialize.
