  class: PlayerbotTradeConfig
  method: RemoveProtectedItem
  signature: void PlayerbotTradeConfig::RemoveProtectedItem(uint32 itemEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified item entry from the protected items list in playerbot
    trade configuration.
  description: The RemoveProtectedItem method removes a given item entry from the
    list of protected items within the PlayerbotTradeConfig class. This functionality
    is typically used in player bot trading behaviors to allow certain items to be
    traded or sold while keeping others protected. The method operates on the internal
    data structure that maintains a set of item entries that should not be traded
    under normal circumstances. It does not validate whether the item entry exists
    before attempting removal, and it assumes the provided item entry is valid for
    the game's item system.
  parameters:
  - name: itemEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the item to be removed from the
      protected items list. This corresponds to the item's database entry in the game's
      item template table.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a specific item from protection
    code: 'PlayerbotTradeConfig tradeConfig;

      tradeConfig.RemoveProtectedItem(12345); // Removes item with entry ID 12345
      from protected list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state of the PlayerbotTradeConfig instance.
    It should be called carefully to avoid unintended behavior in trading logic. The
    implementation likely uses a container such as std::set or std::unordered_set
    for efficient lookup and removal operations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemEntry (e.g., zero or non-existent
    item ID) may result in undefined behavior if the internal data structure does
    not handle such cases gracefully. Ensure that the item entry is valid before calling
    this method.
