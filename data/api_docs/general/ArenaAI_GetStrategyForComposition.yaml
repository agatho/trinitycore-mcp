api:
  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetStrategyForComposition
  signature: ArenaStrategy ArenaAI::GetStrategyForComposition(TeamComposition teamComp,
    TeamComposition enemyComp) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the optimal arena strategy based on the composition
    of the player's team and the enemy team.
  description: The GetStrategyForComposition method evaluates the given team compositions
    for both the player's team and the opposing team to determine the most effective
    arena strategy. This method is used by the ArenaAI class to dynamically select
    tactics that counter the enemy's roster composition. The strategy returned can
    influence how NPCs behave during arena battles, including their spell selection,
    positioning, and overall combat approach. The method considers various factors
    such as class synergy, role distribution, and known counter-strategies within
    the context of World of Warcraft's arena gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: teamComp
    description: The composition of the player's team, represented as a TeamComposition
      object containing information about each class and role present.
  - name: enemyComp
    description: The composition of the enemy team, also represented as a TeamComposition
      object with similar details about their classes and roles.
  returns: An ArenaStrategy enum value that represents the recommended strategy for
    the given team compositions. Possible values may include STRATEGY_BALANCED, STRATEGY_AGRO,
    STRATEGY_DEFENSIVE, or other strategy types depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ArenaStrategy strategy = arenaAI.GetStrategyForComposition(playerTeam,
      enemyTeam);

      // Use the returned strategy to adjust AI behavior during an arena match'
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Selection Based on Composition
    code: "TeamComposition playerComp;\nTeamComposition enemyComp;\n// ... populate\
      \ compositions with class data\nArenaStrategy strategy = arenaAI.GetStrategyForComposition(playerComp,\
      \ enemyComp);\nswitch (strategy) {\n    case STRATEGY_BALANCED:\n        //\
      \ Apply balanced combat tactics\n        break;\n    case STRATEGY_AGRO:\n \
      \       // Apply aggressive offensive tactics\n        break;\n    default:\n\
      \        // Default strategy handling\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during arena match initialization or when
    team compositions change. It may involve complex logic to evaluate class interactions,
    role balance, and known counter-strategies. The implementation likely caches results
    for performance if the same compositions are encountered repeatedly.
  warnings: Ensure that both TeamComposition objects are properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid or incomplete data could lead to incorrect strategy
    selection. This method should not be called during active combat without considering
    potential performance impacts.
