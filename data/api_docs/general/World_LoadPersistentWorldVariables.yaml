  method: LoadPersistentWorldVariables
  signature: void World::LoadPersistentWorldVariables()
documentation:
  brief: Loads persistent world variables from the database into memory for use during
    server operation.
  description: The LoadPersistentWorldVariables method initializes and loads all persistent
    world variables stored in the database into the World object's internal data structures.
    These variables are typically used to maintain server state across restarts, such
    as event timers, quest progress, or custom server settings. The method is usually
    invoked during server startup or initialization phase to ensure that all necessary
    persistent data is available for gameplay mechanics. This process involves querying
    the database for specific variable records and populating corresponding internal
    storage structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::Initialize()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n\
      \    LoadPersistentWorldVariables();\n    // ... continue with rest of initialization\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the World object's initialization
    phase and should not be invoked repeatedly during normal operation. The loading
    process may involve database queries that could impact startup time if there are
    many persistent variables. It's recommended to ensure database connectivity and
    proper permissions before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times during runtime can lead to duplicate
    variable entries or memory leaks. The method assumes the database connection is
    already established and functional. If database access fails, the method may silently
    fail or throw exceptions depending on implementation details.
