  brief: Reward player and group members with experience points and honor for completing
    a quest event
  description: This method rewards players and their group members with experience
    points and honor when a creature quest event is completed. It handles both individual
    player rewards and group-based rewards, ensuring that all group members receive
    appropriate credit for the event completion. The method typically triggers when
    a player interacts with a creature that has a quest associated with it, and the
    reward is applied based on the creature's ID and the player's quest completion
    status.
  parameters:
  - name: creature_id
    description: The unique identifier of the creature that triggered the quest event.
      This ID determines which rewards are given to players and group members.
  - name: pRewardSource
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing reward source information.
      This parameter typically contains values related to quest completion, experience
      points, and honor rewards.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void RewardPlayerAndGroupAtEvent(uint32 creature_id, int * pRewardSource)\n\
      {\n    // Implementation example\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if\
      \ (player && player->GetQuestStatus(questId) == QuestStatus::QUEST_COMPLETE)\n\
      \    {\n        player->RewardPlayerAndGroupAtEvent(creature_id, pRewardSource);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest completion events and requires
    proper handling of group members. The method may be invoked multiple times depending
    on the creature's quest requirements and player's quest status.
  warnings: The method should only be called when a player has completed a quest associated
    with the creature. Calling this method without proper quest completion status
    can result in incorrect rewards or game mechanics issues.
