documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of another PlayerLootProfile's resources to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources from the source
    PlayerLootProfile object to this object, leaving the source in a valid but unspecified
    state. This operation is typically used to efficiently transfer loot-related data
    structures without unnecessary copying. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore, this method would be involved in managing player-specific loot settings
    and preferences during gameplay operations such as loot distribution or profile
    switching.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to this PlayerLootProfile instance after the move assignment
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'PlayerLootProfile profile1;

      PlayerLootProfile profile2 = std::move(profile1);

      // profile1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // profile2 contains all the data previously in profile1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a move operation, which is more efficient than copy
    assignment as it transfers ownership of resources rather than duplicating them.
    The source object after move assignment should not be used in a meaningful way
    until reassigned.
