documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotLevelManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotLevelManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global bot level management
    functionality within the TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer provides
    access to all bot level-related operations such as level progression, experience
    calculation, and difficulty scaling. This implementation follows standard singleton
    conventions where the first call creates the instance and subsequent calls return
    the same instance reference.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotLevelManager instance. The method never returns
    NULL as it is implemented to always provide a valid singleton instance.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotLevelManager singleton
    code: 'BotLevelManager* levelManager = BotLevelManager::instance();

      uint32 currentLevel = levelManager->GetCurrentBotLevel();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using BotLevelManager for bot progression
    code: "BotLevelManager* manager = BotLevelManager::instance();\nif (manager)\n\
      {\n    uint32 newLevel = manager->CalculateNextLevel(bot);\n    manager->UpdateBotLevel(bot,\
      \ newLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is created during application
    startup. The implementation assumes that the BotLevelManager class is properly
    initialized before any calls to this method are made. The singleton pattern ensures
    consistent bot level management across all parts of the TrinityCore system that
    require access to bot progression data.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that relying on global singletons can make
    unit testing more difficult. Additionally, since this is a singleton, modifications
    to the instance state affect all components using it throughout the application.
