  class: DifficultyChangedHandler
  method: DifficultyChangedHandler
  signature: void DifficultyChangedHandler::DifficultyChangedHandler(BotAI * botAI)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a DifficultyChangedHandler instance with the provided BotAI context.
  description: The DifficultyChangedHandler constructor initializes the handler with
    a BotAI object, which is essential for managing bot behavior changes when the
    difficulty level of a dungeon or raid instance changes. This handler typically
    responds to game events related to difficulty adjustments and ensures that the
    bot's AI adapts appropriately to maintain balanced gameplay. The method sets up
    internal state and references needed for tracking and reacting to difficulty modifications
    during player encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: botAI
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this handler will manage. Must
      not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of DifficultyChangedHandler
    code: 'DifficultyChangedHandler handler(botAI);

      // The handler is now initialized with the provided BotAI context

      // and ready to respond to difficulty change events.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any immediate action; it simply stores
    the reference to the BotAI object for later use. The actual handling of difficulty
    changes occurs through event callbacks or polling mechanisms that are not part
    of this constructor.
