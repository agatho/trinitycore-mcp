  class: MovementInfo
  method: SetExtraMovementFlags2
  signature: void MovementInfo::SetExtraMovementFlags2(uint32 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the extra movement flags2 value for the MovementInfo object.
  description: The SetExtraMovementFlags2 method assigns a specified 32-bit flag value
    to the internal extra movement flags2 field of the MovementInfo class. This flag
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's packet serialization and network communication
    to represent additional movement-related states or behaviors that are not covered
    by standard movement flags. The method directly modifies the object's state without
    returning any value. It is commonly invoked when preparing movement updates for
    players or creatures, particularly during client-server synchronization or when
    applying special movement effects such as flying, swimming, or root status.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the extra movement flags2
      to be set. This value should correspond to predefined movement flag constants
      defined in the TrinityCore codebase, such as those related to flying, swimming,
      or other special movement states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Extra Movement Flags for Flying State
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      movementInfo.SetExtraMovementFlags2(MOVEFLAG2_FLYING);

      // This sets the movement info to indicate that the unit is currently flying.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combining Multiple Extra Movement Flags
    code: 'MovementInfo movementInfo;

      uint32 flags = MOVEFLAG2_FLYING | MOVEFLAG2_SWIMMING | MOVEFLAG2_ROOTED;

      movementInfo.SetExtraMovementFlags2(flags);

      // This sets multiple movement states simultaneously.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the MovementInfo object.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related methods and should
    be called before serializing movement data for network transmission. The flag
    values passed to this method must align with the expected constants defined in
    the TrinityCore movement system.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the extra movement flags2 can lead to unexpected client
    behavior or synchronization issues between server and client. Ensure that the
    provided flag value is valid and corresponds to known movement states within the
    TrinityCore framework.
