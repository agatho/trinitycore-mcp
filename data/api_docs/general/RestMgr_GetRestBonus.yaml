documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the rest bonus multiplier based on the specified rest
    type.
  description: The GetRestBonus method retrieves a floating-point value representing
    the bonus multiplier applied to experience or gold gains when a player rests in
    a designated area. This value varies depending on the type of rest (e.g., normal
    rest, inn rest, or dungeon rest) and is used internally by the game engine to
    adjust rewards accordingly. The method does not take any parameters and returns
    a float that represents how much bonus the player receives for resting in a specific
    location. It's typically called during rest-related events such as when a player
    logs in or exits a dungeon.
  parameters: []
  returns: A floating-point value representing the rest bonus multiplier. For example,
    a return value of 1.0 indicates no bonus, while 1.5 would indicate a 50% bonus
    to rewards.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float bonus = sRestMgr->GetRestBonus(REST_TYPE_INN);

      // Returns the bonus multiplier for resting in an inn'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Rest Bonus to Experience
    code: 'uint32 baseXP = 1000;

      float bonus = sRestMgr->GetRestBonus(REST_TYPE_NORMAL);

      uint32 finalXP = baseXP * bonus;

      // Applies the rest bonus to calculated experience gain'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal rest management system in TrinityCore
    and relies on configuration settings and player state. It may return different
    values depending on server rules, expansion content, or custom modifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the RestTypes enum used matches the expected values in your
    version of TrinityCore; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur. This method
    should only be called during valid rest-related events to avoid incorrect bonus
    calculations.
