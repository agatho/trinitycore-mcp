  class: EvokerAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void EvokerAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes resource cost for a specified spell within the Evoker AI behavior.
  description: The ConsumeResource method is responsible for deducting the required
    mana or other resource costs associated with casting a specific spell in the context
    of an Evoker's AI. This method ensures that the AI respects the resource constraints
    of the spell being cast, preventing invalid or impossible actions. It typically
    interacts with the Evoker's current resource pool and updates it accordingly after
    a spell is consumed. The method is part of the core AI decision-making logic for
    Evokers in TrinityCore, ensuring proper resource management during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell whose resource cost needs to be
      consumed. This ID corresponds to a spell defined in the game's spell database
      and determines the amount of mana or other resources required for casting.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Consume resource for a basic Evoker spell
    code: "void EvokerAI::CastSpellWithResource(int spellId)\n{\n    // Check if the\
      \ evoker has enough resources\n    if (HasEnoughResources(spellId))\n    {\n\
      \        // Consume the required resources\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n\
      \        \n        // Cast the spell\n        DoCast(spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Evoker AI when it decides
    to cast a spell. It assumes that resource validation has already been performed,
    and the spell can be cast. The actual resource deduction logic may vary depending
    on the spell type (mana, soul, etc.) and the specific implementation in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without prior validation of resource availability
    may lead to invalid AI behavior or game state inconsistencies. Ensure that resource
    checks are performed before calling this method.
