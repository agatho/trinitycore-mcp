  brief: Updates the password change timestamp for a specified user in the database.
  description: The PasswordChangedAppend method is responsible for recording or updating
    the timestamp of when a player's password was last changed. This method typically
    interacts with the authentication system to ensure that password modifications
    are properly logged and tracked within the TrinityCore database. It may be invoked
    during account management operations, such as when a user successfully changes
    their password through the game client or web interface. The method accepts a
    unique identifier (GUID) for the player whose password change is being recorded.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose password change
      timestamp needs to be updated in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Password Change Timestamp for a Player
    code: 'PasswordChangedAppend::PasswordChangedAppend(playerGuid);

      // This call updates the last password change time for the player with GUID
      ''playerGuid''.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger authentication or account management
    system. It may perform database writes to update the 'last_password_change' field
    in the account table. Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing
    player account to avoid errors.
