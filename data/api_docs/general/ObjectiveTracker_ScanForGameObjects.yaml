  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: ScanForGameObjects
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::ScanForGameObjects(Player * bot, uint32 objectId,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Scans for game objects near the player within a specified radius and returns
    the count of matching objects.
  description: The ScanForGameObjects method searches for game objects in the vicinity
    of a given player within a defined radius. It is typically used by the objective
    tracker system to identify nearby quest-related or interactive objects such as
    chests, doors, or quest markers. The method iterates through all game objects
    in the player's current map and checks their distance against the specified radius.
    This functionality supports automated quest tracking and objective completion
    detection in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment. The method assumes the
    player is valid and within a valid map context.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player character
      performing the scan. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: objectId
    description: The unique identifier of the game object type to search for. This
      corresponds to the GameObjectTemplate entry ID in the database.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the player's position to consider
      for scanning. Objects beyond this radius are ignored.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of game objects matching the
    specified type and within the given radius. A return value of zero indicates no
    matching objects were found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to scan for quest items
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player instance\nint count = objectiveTracker->ScanForGameObjects(player,\
      \ 176245, 10.0f); // Scan for specific quest object within 10 yards\nif (count\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process found objects\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with dynamic radius
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 questObjectId = GetQuestObjectiveId(player->GetQuestId());\n\
      float searchRadius = GetQuestSearchRadius(player->GetQuestId());\nint foundObjects\
      \ = objectiveTracker->ScanForGameObjects(player, questObjectId, searchRadius);\n\
      if (foundObjects > 0)\n{\n    // Trigger quest update or objective completion\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear scan of all game objects in the player's current
    map. Performance may degrade with many objects present. The radius is measured
    in yards, consistent with World of Warcraft's coordinate system. The method does
    not modify any game state; it only reads object positions and types.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid to prevent crashes. Passing
    an invalid or null player pointer will result in undefined behavior. The objectId
    should correspond to a valid GameObjectTemplate entry, otherwise the scan may
    return unexpected results.
