    spec)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the appropriate group role based on class and specialization.
  description: The DetermineRoleFromClass method maps a player's class and specialization
    to a predefined group role. This is used internally by TrinityCore's group management
    system to assign roles such as Tank, Healer, or Damage Dealer (DPS) for optimal
    group composition and loot distribution. The method evaluates the provided class
    ID and spec ID against internal mappings to return an appropriate GroupRole enum
    value. It assumes valid inputs and does not perform input validation.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The player's class identifier (e.g., WARRIOR = 1, PALADIN = 2, HUNTER
      = 3, etc.). Must be a valid class ID from the game's class definitions.
  - name: spec
    description: The player's specialization index. For each class, this represents
      one of the available specializations (e.g., 0 = Arms, 1 = Fury, 2 = Protection
      for Warriors). Valid range depends on the class.
  returns: Returns a GroupRole enum value indicating the role assigned to the player
    based on their class and specialization. Possible values include GROUP_ROLE_TANK,
    GROUP_ROLE_HEALER, GROUP_ROLE_DPS, or GROUP_ROLE_NONE if no specific role can
    be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Determine role for a Frost Mage
    code: GroupRole role = groupIntegration.DetermineRoleFromClass(CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_MAGE_FROST);
      // Returns GROUP_ROLE_DPS
    language: cpp
  - title: Determine role for a Protection Paladin
    code: GroupRole role = groupIntegration.DetermineRoleFromClass(CLASS_PALADIN,
      SPEC_PALADIN_PROTECTION); // Returns GROUP_ROLE_TANK
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during group creation or reorganization to
    assign roles automatically. The mapping between class/spec and role is defined
    in the core's internal configuration and may be adjusted by server administrators.
  warnings: Ensure that classId and spec values are valid before calling this method,
    as invalid inputs could result in undefined behavior or incorrect role assignment.
    This function does not validate input parameters.
