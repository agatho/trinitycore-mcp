  signature: float BotCharacterDistribution::GetRaceClassPercentage(uint8 race, uint8
    classId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the percentage distribution of a specific race and
    class combination within the bot character distribution system.
  description: The GetRaceClassPercentage method retrieves the calculated percentage
    value representing how frequently a specific race-class combination appears in
    the bot character distribution configuration. This method is typically used to
    determine the likelihood or weight of spawning bots with particular racial and
    class characteristics. The returned value is a floating-point number between 0.0
    and 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no occurrence and 100.0 represents maximum frequency.
    The method does not take any parameters as it operates on internal configuration
    data that defines the distribution rules for bot characters across different races
    and classes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the percentage weight of the specified race-class
    combination in the bot character distribution. Values range from 0.0 (never spawned)
    to 100.0 (always spawned). Returns 0.0 if the race-class combination is not defined
    or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve percentage for Human Warrior
    code: "float percentage = botDistribution.GetRaceClassPercentage(RACE_HUMAN, CLASS_WARRIOR);\n\
      if (percentage > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use the percentage to determine spawn probability\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Human Warriors occur at \" << percentage << \"%\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal data structures that define bot character
    distribution rules. It may be called frequently during bot spawning logic, so
    performance optimization is important. The implementation should handle invalid
    race or class IDs gracefully by returning 0.0.
  warnings: Ensure that the race and class parameters are valid identifiers from the
    TrinityCore constants (e.g., RACE_HUMAN, CLASS_WARRIOR). Using invalid values
    may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect percentage calculations.
