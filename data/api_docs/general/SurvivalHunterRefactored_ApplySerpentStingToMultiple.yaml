documentation:
  brief: Applies the Serpent Sting ability to multiple targets within range.
  description: This method implements the Survival Hunter's Serpent Sting ability,
    which is applied to multiple nearby enemies. The function determines eligible
    targets based on game mechanics such as line of sight, distance, and target validity.
    It applies the damage-over-time effect to each affected target, potentially increasing
    the hunter's damage output through the improved Serpent Sting talent. This method
    is typically called when the hunter's primary ability is activated or when specific
    combat conditions are met.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    if (player->GetShapeshiftForm() == FORM_CAT\
      \ || player->GetShapeshiftForm() == FORM_BEAR)\n        return;\n    \n    if\
      \ (player->HasAura(SPELL_SERPENT_STING))\n        ApplySerpentStingToMultiple();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal target selection logic to determine which
    enemies are affected. It may be called automatically by the AI system or manually
    during specific combat sequences. The number of targets affected is determined
    by game rules and talents.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter has sufficient mana before calling this function,
    as Serpent Sting consumes resources. Calling this method without proper target
    validation may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
