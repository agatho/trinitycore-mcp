documentation:
  brief: Updates the mana soul shard resource based on elapsed time.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for updating the internal state
    of the ManaSoulShardResourceDestro class, typically called during game ticks to
    simulate the natural regeneration of mana soul shards over time. This method processes
    the time difference (diff) passed as a parameter and adjusts the resource count
    accordingly, ensuring that players can gradually restore their mana soul shard
    capacity based on game mechanics such as passive regeneration or specific buff
    effects. It is designed to be invoked regularly by the game loop to maintain accurate
    resource state.

  - title: Basic Regeneration Call
    code: 'ManaSoulShardResourceDestro resource;

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second

      resource.Regenerate(deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal timers or counters to track regeneration
    progress. It should be called consistently during the game update cycle for accurate
    behavior.
