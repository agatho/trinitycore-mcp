api:
  class: PlayerChoiceData
  method: AddResponse
  signature: void PlayerChoiceData::AddResponse(uint32 id, uint16 clientIdentifier)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new response to the player choice data with the specified ID and client
    identifier.
  description: The AddResponse method is used to register a new response option within
    a player choice dialog. This method associates a unique identifier (id) with a
    client-side identifier (clientIdentifier) that represents how the response should
    be displayed or handled on the client side. The method is typically called during
    the initialization or setup phase of a player choice interaction, allowing the
    server to define available options for the player to select from. It's important
    to note that this method does not validate whether the provided identifiers are
    unique or valid within the context of the current player choice; it simply adds
    the response to the internal data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for this specific response option. This value
      is used internally by the server to distinguish between different response choices.
  - name: clientIdentifier
    description: The client-side identifier that maps to how the response should be
      displayed or processed on the client side. This typically corresponds to a specific
      UI element or action in the game interface.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = new PlayerChoiceData();

      choiceData->AddResponse(1, 1001);

      choiceData->AddResponse(2, 1002);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Responses in Loop
    code: "PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = new PlayerChoiceData();\nfor (uint32 i =\
      \ 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    choiceData->AddResponse(i, 2000 + i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the PlayerChoiceData object. It's
    recommended to call this method before presenting the player choice dialog to
    ensure all responses are properly registered. The method does not perform any
    validation on input parameters, so developers should ensure that the provided
    IDs and client identifiers are meaningful within their specific context.
  warnings: Calling AddResponse after the player choice has already been presented
    to a player may result in undefined behavior or missing responses in the UI. Additionally,
    duplicate IDs or clientIdentifiers might cause unexpected issues if not properly
    managed by the calling code.
