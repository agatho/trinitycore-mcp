  class: KitingMetrics
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float KitingMetrics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the kiting success rate percentage for a player.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the overall kiting success rate
    of a player based on their combat performance metrics. This metric typically represents
    the ratio of successful kiting attempts to total kiting attempts during a specific
    period or session. The method aggregates data from various kiting-related statistics
    such as distance maintained, enemy proximity tracking, and successful evasion
    events. It is commonly used in player performance analysis and achievement systems
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the kiting success rate as a percentage.
    Values typically range from 0.0 to 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no successful kiting
    attempts and 100.0 indicates perfect kiting performance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'KitingMetrics metrics;

      float successRate = metrics.GetSuccessRate();

      std::cout << "Kiting Success Rate: " << successRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Analysis
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nKitingMetrics& playerMetrics\
      \ = player->GetKitingMetrics();\nfloat rate = playerMetrics.GetSuccessRate();\n\
      if (rate >= 90.0f)\n{\n    // Player has excellent kiting skills\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      Excellent kiting performance!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs calculations based on internal kiting statistics
    that are updated during combat events. The implementation may cache results to
    improve performance and avoid recalculating the same values repeatedly. The accuracy
    of the returned value depends on the completeness and correctness of the underlying
    kiting data collection system.
  warnings: The method assumes that kiting metrics have been properly initialized
    and updated before calling. If called before any kiting events have occurred,
    it may return unexpected or meaningless values. Additionally, this method should
    not be called from within combat-critical code paths due to potential performance
    implications of metric calculations.
