  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetPlayersInArea
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetPlayersInArea(const int & center, float
    radius)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of players within a specified radius around a given
    center point in the spatial grid.
  description: The GetPlayersInArea method queries the DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid to
    count how many players are located within a circular area defined by a center
    point and a radius. This method is commonly used in game mechanics such as area-of-effect
    spell targeting, player detection, or proximity-based events. It operates on a
    spatial grid structure that efficiently organizes player positions for fast lookup.
    The method does not return the actual player objects but rather provides a count
    of players in the specified area. The center parameter likely represents a coordinate
    or grid cell identifier, and the radius defines the search distance in world units.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the area to search for players. This is typically
      represented as an integer identifier corresponding to a grid cell or spatial
      coordinate.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area around the center point in which
      to search for players. Units are typically world coordinates.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of players found within the
    specified area. A return value of zero indicates no players were found in the
    area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to count players in a radius
    code: int playerCount = grid.GetPlayersInArea(12345, 10.0f); // Count players
      within 10 units of center point 12345
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to trigger an event when players are nearby
    code: "int count = grid.GetPlayersInArea(player->GetGridX(), 5.0f);\nif (count\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Trigger some area effect or notification\n    SendAreaEffectMessage(\"\
      Players detected nearby!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a double-buffered spatial grid structure for thread
    safety and performance optimization. It may perform best when the center point
    is aligned with grid boundaries. The radius parameter should be carefully considered
    to avoid excessive computation if set too high.
  warnings: Ensure that the center parameter corresponds to a valid grid cell or coordinate
    in the current spatial grid. Using an invalid center may lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. Be cautious when using large radius values as they may impact
    performance.
