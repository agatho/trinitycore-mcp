documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the healing bonus applied to a spell based on the
    target's health and other factors.
  description: This method determines the additional healing amount that a spell provides
    to a target, taking into account various factors such as the spell's base healing
    amount, damage type, stack count, and aura effects. It is used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's spell system to calculate bonus healing values for different
    types of spells, particularly those related to healing mechanics. The method considers
    the victim's health status, spell properties, and other relevant game mechanics
    to determine the final healing bonus value.
  parameters:
  - name: victim
    description: The target unit receiving the healing. This parameter defines which
      unit's health and other properties are considered for calculating the bonus.
  - name: spellProto
    description: Pointer to the SpellInfo structure containing the spell's base information.
      This includes details about the spell such as its effect type, base healing
      amount, and other properties that influence the calculation.
  - name: healamount
    description: The base healing amount being calculated. This represents the initial
      healing value before bonus calculations are applied.
  - name: damagetype
    description: The type of damage or healing being applied. This determines how
      the healing bonus is calculated based on the specific type of effect (e.g.,
      direct heal, periodic heal).
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Reference to the SpellEffectInfo structure containing details about
      the spell's effect. This includes information about the effect's parameters
      and how it affects healing calculations.
  - name: stack
    description: The number of stacks for the spell's effect. This indicates how many
      times the effect is applied, which can influence the final bonus calculation.
  - name: spell
    description: Pointer to the Spell object being processed. This represents the
      specific spell instance that is being calculated and determines how the healing
      bonus is applied.
  - name: aurEff
    description: Pointer to the AuraEffect object that provides additional context
      for the calculation. This includes information about the aura's effects and
      how they influence the healing bonus.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated healing bonus amount.
    The value may be positive or negative depending on the spell's properties and
    the target's health status, and represents the final adjusted healing amount after
    all bonus calculations have been applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Bonus Calculation
    code: 'int32 bonus = unit->SpellHealingBonusDone(target, spellInfo, healAmount,
      SPELL_DAMAGE_TYPE, spellEffectInfo, stackCount, spell, auraEffect);

      // This calculates the healing bonus for a specific spell

      // The result is used in the final healing calculation'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Healing Bonus with Aura Effects
    code: 'int32 bonus = unit->SpellHealingBonusDone(target, spellInfo, healAmount,
      SPELL_DAMAGE_TYPE, spellEffectInfo, stackCount, spell, auraEffect);

      // This method is used in conjunction with other healing calculations

      // to determine the final healing amount for a spell with multiple effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core spell system and should be used carefully
    when calculating healing bonuses. It's important to note that this method may
    not always return a positive value, as some spells may have negative healing bonuses
    based on game mechanics. Performance considerations include the need for proper
    handling of multiple parameters and the potential for complex calculations involving
    various spell effects.
  warnings: This method should be used with caution when calculating healing bonuses,
    especially in complex scenarios involving multiple spell effects or aura interactions.
    It's important to ensure that all parameters are properly initialized before calling
    this method, as incorrect parameter values can lead to inaccurate healing bonus
    calculations.
