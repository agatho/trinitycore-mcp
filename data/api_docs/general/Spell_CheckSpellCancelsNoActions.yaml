  method: CheckSpellCancelsNoActions
  signature: bool Spell::CheckSpellCancelsNoActions(int32 * param1) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell cancels no actions and returns true if it does.
  description: This method evaluates whether a spell has the property of cancelling
    no actions, which typically occurs when a spell is designed to prevent any action
    from being taken during its execution. The method checks for specific conditions
    that would make the spell cancel actions, such as being a non-action spell or
    having certain flags set. It's commonly used in spell mechanics to determine if
    a spell should interrupt other actions or not. This functionality is crucial for
    maintaining game balance and preventing conflicts between different spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell cancels no actions, false otherwise. The method
    returns a boolean value indicating whether the spell's action cancellation properties
    are met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->CheckSpellCancelsNoActions()) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking internal spell flags or properties,
    and may be used in conjunction with other spell-related methods to determine action
    cancellation behavior. Performance considerations include checking multiple conditions
    during spell evaluation.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without understanding of the underlying
    spell mechanics. Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected behavior in spell execution
    or action interruption.
