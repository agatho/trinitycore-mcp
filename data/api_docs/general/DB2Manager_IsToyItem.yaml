documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given item ID corresponds to a toy item in the game
    database.
  description: The IsToyItem method checks if a specified item ID represents a toy
    item within the TrinityCore database. This functionality is commonly used in game
    logic to identify items that are classified as toys, which may have special handling
    or restrictions in gameplay mechanics such as being usable only in specific contexts
    or having unique visual properties. The method performs a lookup against internal
    DB2 data structures that contain item classification information. It returns true
    if the item is classified as a toy, and false otherwise. This check is essential
    for features like inventory management, quest completion conditions, and preventing
    inappropriate use of toy items in non-appropriate contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified item ID corresponds to a toy item in the
    database; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an item is a toy
    code: "if (sDB2Manager->IsToyItem(12345)) {\n    // Handle toy item logic\n  \
      \  printf(\"Item 12345 is a toy.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle non-toy item\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Item 12345 is not a toy.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal DB2 data structures that must be properly
    loaded and initialized before use. The implementation likely uses cached or indexed
    lookups for performance, making repeated calls efficient. It is important to ensure
    that the item ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds to an actual item
    in the database.
  warnings: This method should not be used with invalid or uninitialized item IDs
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that any item
    ID being checked has been validated against the game's item database before calling
    this function.
