  method: GetQuestSlotCounter
  signature: uint16 Player::GetQuestSlotCounter(uint16 slot, uint8 counter) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the counter value for a specific quest slot in the player's quest
    log.
  description: This method returns the current counter value associated with a specified
    quest slot, allowing players to track progress toward quest objectives. The counter
    represents the number of times a quest objective has been completed or the current
    progress state of a quest. It is commonly used for tracking quest completion status
    and managing quest-related game mechanics such as quest progression and reward
    fulfillment.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot index to retrieve the counter value from, typically
      ranging from 0-63 depending on the player's quest log capacity.
  - name: counter
    description: The specific counter type to retrieve (0-255), representing different
      types of quest progress tracking such as kills, collects, or other objective
      types.
  returns: Returns the uint16 value representing the current counter state for the
    specified quest slot and counter type, which can be zero or higher depending on
    quest progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint16 counter = player->GetQuestSlotCounter(5, 0);

      // Returns the counter value for quest slot 5, counter type 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "uint16 counter = player->GetQuestSlotCounter(20, 1);\nif (counter > 0)\
      \ {\n    // Process quest progress\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest not started or completed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the player's quest management system and should be
    used carefully when tracking quest progress. This method does not modify any internal
    state; it simply retrieves values from the player's quest log.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid slot or counter values,
    as it may return unexpected results or cause undefined behavior if used improperly.
