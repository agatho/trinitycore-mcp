  class: HotStreakTracker
  method: ConsumeHotStreak
  signature: void HotStreakTracker::ConsumeHotStreak()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes the current hot streak effect, removing it from the tracker and
    applying its benefits.
  description: The ConsumeHotStreak method is responsible for depleting or activating
    the currently tracked hot streak effect within the HotStreakTracker class. This
    typically occurs when a spell or ability that triggers a hot streak is cast, and
    the tracker has been previously updated with the relevant hot streak state. The
    method will usually decrement internal counters, apply any necessary buffs or
    effects to the affected unit, and reset or clear the hot streak state so subsequent
    actions can be properly tracked. This method is generally called during spell
    execution or combat events where a hot streak effect should be consumed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Effect
    code: "void FireballSpell::EffectExecute(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (hotStreakTracker.HasHotStreak())\n\
      \    {\n        hotStreakTracker.ConsumeHotStreak();\n        // Apply additional\
      \ damage or effect based on hot streak\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a valid hot streak is present in the
    tracker. It's recommended to check HasHotStreak() before calling this function
    to avoid unintended behavior. The internal state of the HotStreakTracker must
    be properly initialized before invoking this method.
  warnings: Calling ConsumeHotStreak without verifying that a hot streak exists may
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect game state updates. Ensure proper synchronization
    if used in multi-threaded contexts such as combat processing loops.
