  method: ShouldUseLayOnHands
  signature: bool PaladinAI::ShouldUseLayOnHands() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the paladin should use Lay on Hands based on current health
    and mana conditions.
  description: The ShouldUseLayOnHands method evaluates the paladin's current health
    percentage, mana availability, and target conditions to decide if using the Lay
    on Hands ability is beneficial. This method considers both self-healing and healing
    of party members or targets within range. It checks for sufficient mana to cast
    the spell and ensures that the target has low enough health to benefit from the
    healing effect. The decision-making process also accounts for cooldowns and other
    resource constraints that may prevent the use of Lay on Hands at the current moment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if Lay on Hands should be used based on the current state
    and conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (paladinAI->ShouldUseLayOnHands()) {\n    // Execute Lay on Hands\n\
      \    paladinAI->DoCast(me, SPELL_LAY_ON_HANDS);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with health check
    code: "if (paladinAI->ShouldUseLayOnHands() && me->GetHealthPct() < 30.0f) {\n\
      \    // Use Lay on Hands for self-healing\n    paladinAI->DoCast(me, SPELL_LAY_ON_HANDS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Paladin AI system and integrates with TrinityCore's
    combat decision-making framework. It relies on internal state tracking of health
    percentages, mana levels, and target information to make decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the paladin has sufficient mana before calling this method
    to avoid failed spell casts. The method does not account for external factors
    like crowd control or positioning that might affect spell casting success.
