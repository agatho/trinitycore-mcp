  method: HandleOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: bool HunterAI::HandleOffensiveCooldowns(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles offensive cooldowns for the hunter AI, determining if an attack can
    be executed based on cooldown state.
  description: The HandleOffensiveCooldowns method in HunterAI evaluates whether the
    hunter's offensive abilities are ready to be used. It checks the current cooldown
    status of offensive spells or abilities and determines if it is appropriate to
    initiate an attack. This method typically integrates with the AI decision-making
    process to ensure that abilities are not used prematurely, respecting game balance
    and mechanics such as global cooldowns and ability-specific cooldown timers. The
    method may also update internal state variables related to ability usage timing.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if offensive cooldowns are handled successfully and the hunter
    can proceed with an attack; returns false if cooldowns prevent action or if no
    valid target is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Loop
    code: "if (hunterAI->HandleOffensiveCooldowns(&targetId)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ offensive ability\n    hunterAI->CastSpell(targetId, SPELL_AIMED_SHOT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI logic and should be called within the context
    of a larger decision-making loop. It assumes that a valid target exists and may
    modify internal state related to cooldown tracking.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    invalid targets can lead to undefined behavior or failed ability execution. This
    method does not perform target validation itself.
