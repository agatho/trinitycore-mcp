  class: HealerPositioning
  method: IsInOptimalHealingRange
  signature: bool HealerPositioning::IsInOptimalHealingRange(Player * healer, const
    int & allies)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a healer is within optimal range to efficiently heal a
    specified number of allies.
  description: The IsInOptimalHealingRange method evaluates if a given healer player
    is positioned optimally to effectively heal a certain number of nearby allies.
    This function likely considers factors such as the healer's spell range, the positioning
    of target allies, and game mechanics related to healing efficiency. It returns
    true if the healer can reach all specified allies within their healing capabilities,
    and false otherwise. The method is typically used in AI decision-making processes
    for healers to determine optimal positioning during combat or group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: healer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer whose positioning
      is being evaluated.
  - name: allies
    description: Reference to an integer indicating the number of allies that need
      to be healed. This parameter determines how many targets the healer must be
      able to reach.
  returns: Returns true if the healer is within optimal range to heal all specified
    allies, false otherwise. The exact criteria for 'optimal' may depend on game mechanics
    such as spell range, line of sight, and target positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a healing AI
    code: "if (HealerPositioning::IsInOptimalHealingRange(playerHealer, 3)) {\n  \
      \  // Perform healing action\n    playerHealer->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HEALING_SPELL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer to allies or reposition\n    playerHealer->MoveTowards(allies[0]);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a loop for multiple targets
    code: "int totalAllies = 5;\nfor (int i = 0; i < totalAllies; ++i) {\n    if (!HealerPositioning::IsInOptimalHealingRange(playerHealer,\
      \ i + 1)) {\n        // Adjust positioning for optimal healing\n        playerHealer->AdjustPositionForHealing();\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may internally use distance calculations and spell range checks
    to determine optimal positioning. It's important to note that the effectiveness
    of healing can also depend on factors like line of sight, target health, and spell
    cooldowns. The implementation might be optimized for performance in high-frequency
    AI decision-making scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the healer and allies are properly initialized before calling
    this method, as passing null pointers could lead to undefined behavior. Also,
    be aware that positioning may change dynamically during combat, so repeated calls
    may be necessary to maintain optimal healing range.
