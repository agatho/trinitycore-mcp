documentation:
  brief: Retrieves jump charge parameters for a specified ID
  description: This method retrieves an array of integer parameters associated with
    a specific jump charge ID. The returned pointer points to a constant array of
    integers that define various properties of a jump charge, such as duration, speed,
    or other mechanics related to the jump behavior. The parameters are typically
    used in game logic to control how jump charges behave within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is part of the ObjectMgr class which manages global object data for
    the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an array of integers representing the jump charge parameters
    for the specified ID. Returns nullptr if no parameters are found for the given
    ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use jump charge parameters
    code: "const int* params = sObjectMgr->GetJumpChargeParams(12345);\nif (params\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    int duration = params[0];\n    int speed = params[1];\n\
      \    // Use the parameters for jump logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is managed internally by ObjectMgr and should not be modified
    or freed by callers. The method assumes that valid IDs are passed, as invalid
    IDs may return nullptr without error reporting.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid ID will return a nullptr. Always check
    for null before using the returned pointer to avoid segmentation faults. The size
    of the returned array is not guaranteed and depends on internal data definitions.
