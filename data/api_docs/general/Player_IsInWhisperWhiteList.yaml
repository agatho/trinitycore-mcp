  class: Player
  method: IsInWhisperWhiteList
  signature: bool Player::IsInWhisperWhiteList(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player is in the whisper whitelist for another player.
  description: This method determines whether a specific player is included in the
    whisper whitelist of another player. It is used to verify if a player can receive
    whispers from another player, which is essential for maintaining proper communication
    and privacy settings within the game. The method typically checks against the
    player's own whitelist or the target player's whitelist depending on context.
    This functionality is crucial for preventing unwanted communications and maintaining
    game balance.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check against the whisper
      whitelist
  returns: Returns true if the player is in the whisper whitelist, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player can receive whispers from the specified player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "bool isInWhitelist = player->IsInWhisperWhiteList(12345);\nif (isInWhitelist)\n\
      {\n    // Player can receive whispers\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot receive\
      \ whispers\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves checking against the player's own whitelist entries,
    and may be used in conjunction with other whisper-related methods. Performance
    considerations include checking against large whitelists which could impact efficiency.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may not always reflect current
    game state due to potential caching or data synchronization issues. Also, ensure
    that the GUID being checked is valid and exists in the database.
