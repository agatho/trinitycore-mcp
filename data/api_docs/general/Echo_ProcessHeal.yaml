documentation:
  brief: Processes a healing event for the Echo unit, applying healing effects and
    updating relevant states.
  description: The ProcessHeal method handles the core logic for processing healing
    actions within the Echo class. This method is typically invoked when a healing
    spell or effect is applied to the unit. It manages the application of healing
    values, updates health statistics, and ensures proper interaction with the game's
    combat system. The method may also trigger related events such as healing over
    time effects or aura updates. It is designed to be called during active combat
    scenarios where healing interactions are expected.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Healing Application
    code: 'Echo* echo = new Echo();

      echo->ProcessHeal();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Echo unit has been properly initialized and
    is in a valid state for healing operations. It may internally call other subsystems
    such as the combat manager or aura system to ensure proper healing behavior.
  warnings: Improper initialization of the Echo unit before calling this method can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all required components are loaded
    before invoking ProcessHeal.
