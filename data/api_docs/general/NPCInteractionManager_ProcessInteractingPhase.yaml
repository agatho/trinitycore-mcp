  class: NPCInteractionManager
  method: ProcessInteractingPhase
  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::ProcessInteractingPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the current interacting phase for an NPC, handling dialogue and
    interaction states.
  description: The ProcessInteractingPhase method manages the active interaction state
    between a player and an NPC within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    handles the progression of dialogue trees, updates interaction timers, processes
    quest states, and ensures proper synchronization of NPC behavior during active
    conversations. It is commonly invoked during player-NPC interactions to maintain
    consistent game state and user experience. The method may also handle cleanup
    of temporary interaction data once the interaction concludes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC AI
    code: "void ExampleNPC::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_playerInteraction)\n\
      \        m_npcInteractionManager->ProcessInteractingPhase();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when an NPC interaction is actively in
    progress. It's typically invoked from within the NPC's AI update loop or triggered
    by player interaction events. The method assumes proper initialization of interaction
    state data before execution.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid interaction context may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all preconditions for NPC interaction
    are met before invoking this method.
