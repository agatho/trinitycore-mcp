documentation:
  brief: Updates the weather state and returns true if the weather changed or false
    otherwise.
  description: The Weather::Update method is responsible for managing the dynamic
    behavior of weather systems within a specific zone. It processes time-based changes
    to weather conditions such as rain, snow, or clear skies, and handles transitions
    between different weather states. This method is typically called by the game's
    main update loop at regular intervals to ensure that weather conditions evolve
    realistically over time. The method evaluates internal timers and random chance
    factors to determine when to transition between weather states, and it updates
    the client's weather display accordingly. It returns true if a weather change
    occurred during this update cycle, or false if no changes were made.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the weather state was updated or changed during this call,
    false if no changes occurred. This indicates whether clients need to be notified
    of weather updates.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weather Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateWeather()\n{\n    for (auto& weather : m_zoneWeathers)\n\
      \    {\n        if (weather->Update(1000)) // Update with 1 second time delta\n\
      \        {\n            SendWeatherUpdateToPlayers(weather);\n        }\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the core game loop at fixed intervals.
    The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since last update, which affects
    how quickly weather transitions occur. Weather updates are zone-specific and may
    be influenced by global server settings or player activity.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the core update system without
    understanding the timing implications. Incorrect delta time values can cause unrealistic
    weather behavior or performance issues.
