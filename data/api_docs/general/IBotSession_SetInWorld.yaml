  class: IBotSession
  method: SetInWorld
  signature: void IBotSession::SetInWorld(bool inWorld)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the bot session's in-world status to indicate whether the bot is currently
    active in the game world.
  description: The SetInWorld method updates the internal state of an IBotSession
    to reflect whether the associated bot character is present and active within the
    World of Warcraft game world. This flag is crucial for determining the bot's availability
    for gameplay actions, quest interactions, and other world-based activities. When
    set to true, the bot is considered active and can participate in world events;
    when set to false, it is typically considered inactive or logged out. The method
    does not perform any network operations or game state changes directly, but rather
    updates an internal flag that other systems may query to determine bot status.
  parameters:
  - name: inWorld
    description: Boolean value indicating the bot's world presence. Set to true to
      mark the bot as active in the game world, or false to mark it as inactive or
      logged out.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'botSession->SetInWorld(true);

      // Marks the bot as now being active in the game world'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivating Bot Session
    code: 'botSession->SetInWorld(false);

      // Marks the bot as no longer active in the game world'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore bot framework
    to manage session states. It's important to note that setting this flag does not
    automatically handle character login/logout sequences - it only updates the session's
    internal state. The actual game world presence should be managed through appropriate
    authentication and connection methods.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to inconsistent bot behavior or unexpected
    interactions with other systems that depend on the in-world status. Always ensure
    proper synchronization when changing this flag, especially in multi-threaded environments
    where multiple systems might be checking or modifying the session state simultaneously.
