  method: CalculateDecisionStatistics
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::CalculateDecisionStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and aggregates statistical data for AI decision-making processes
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The CalculateDecisionStatistics method is responsible for processing
    and aggregating performance metrics related to artificial intelligence decision-making
    in World of Warcraft entities. This method analyzes various AI-related data points
    such as decision execution times, success rates, and frequency of different AI
    behaviors. It typically runs during profiling sessions or at specific intervals
    to provide insights into how efficiently the AI system is functioning. The calculated
    statistics are often used for debugging, performance optimization, and understanding
    AI behavior patterns in game scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in Profiling Context
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.CalculateDecisionStatistics();

      // Statistics are now available for analysis or logging'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked internally by the AI profiling system and may
    not be directly called by external code. It's designed to work in conjunction
    with other profiling tools and should be used primarily during development or
    debugging phases.
  warnings: The method may have performance implications if called too frequently,
    as it involves processing potentially large amounts of AI decision data. Ensure
    that this method is only executed when necessary for profiling purposes.
