documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the expected profit value for an auction item based
    on current market data and bot configuration.
  description: The GetExpectedProfit method computes the anticipated profit a bot
    would earn from selling an auction item, taking into account the item's buyout
    price, estimated costs (such as auction house fees), and any configured markup
    or margin settings. This value is typically used by bot AI systems to determine
    whether an auction item is worth listing or if it should be skipped due to low
    profitability. The method performs calculations using internal data structures
    that store pricing information, auction house commission rates, and bot-specific
    profit margins. It does not modify any state and is purely a read-only calculation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the expected profit in copper coins. Returns
    zero if no profitable opportunity exists or if the internal data required for
    calculation is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint64 profit = botAuctionData.GetExpectedProfit();\nif (profit > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with auction listing\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Expected profit:\
      \ {} copper\", profit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Profit Validation
    code: "uint64 expectedProfit = botAuctionData.GetExpectedProfit();\nif (expectedProfit\
      \ >= MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD)\n{\n    // Auction item is profitable\n    bot->ListAuctionItem();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Skip auction due to low profit\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"\
      Skipping auction: Expected profit {} below threshold\", expectedProfit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate internal data such as item buyout price, auction
    house fees, and bot configuration settings. If these values are not properly initialized
    or updated, the returned value may be inaccurate. The calculation is performed
    at the time of method call and does not cache results.
  warnings: Ensure that all relevant auction data and bot configuration parameters
    are correctly set before calling this method. Incorrectly configured markup percentages
    or fee rates can lead to misleading profit estimates. This method should not be
    used in performance-critical code paths without considering its computational
    overhead.
