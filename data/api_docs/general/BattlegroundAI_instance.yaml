  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: instance
  signature: BattlegroundAI * BattlegroundAI::instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the BattlegroundAI instance associated with the current
    battleground.
  description: The instance() method is a static accessor that retrieves the unique
    BattlegroundAI instance for the current battleground. This method allows subsystems
    and game logic to obtain access to the battleground's AI controller, which manages
    the overall behavior, scoring, and state of the battleground. It is commonly used
    by various battleground components such as objectives, players, and game mechanics
    to interact with the overarching battleground logic. The method ensures that only
    one instance exists per battleground and provides a centralized way to access
    battleground-specific data and functionality.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BattlegroundAI instance for the current battleground.
    Returns nullptr if called outside of a battleground context or if no valid instance
    exists.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing battleground AI in game logic
    code: "BattlegroundAI* bgAI = BattlegroundAI::instance();\nif (bgAI)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use the battleground AI for scoring or state management\n    bgAI->Update(1000);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if current context is a battleground
    code: "BattlegroundAI* bgAI = BattlegroundAI::instance();\nif (bgAI != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // We're in a battleground, safe to use bgAI\n    uint32 teamScore =\
      \ bgAI->GetTeamScore(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Not in a battleground\
      \ context\n    sLog->outError(\"Called instance() outside of battleground\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of battleground-specific game
    logic. It relies on internal state tracking to ensure that only one BattlegroundAI
    instance exists per battleground. The returned pointer should be validated before
    use, as it may be null if called outside of a battleground environment. This method
    is thread-safe within the context of a single battleground's update cycle.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a battleground context (e.g., in regular
    world zones) will return nullptr and may lead to null pointer dereferences if
    not properly checked. Developers should always validate the returned pointer before
    using it. This method assumes that the battleground system is properly initialized
    and active.
