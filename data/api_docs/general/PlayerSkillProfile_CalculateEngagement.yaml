  class: PlayerSkillProfile
  method: CalculateEngagement
  signature: void PlayerSkillProfile::CalculateEngagement()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the player's engagement metrics based on skill usage
    and activity.
  description: The CalculateEngagement method computes various engagement-related
    statistics for a player within the TrinityCore framework. This includes evaluating
    how actively the player uses their skills, tracking usage frequency, and updating
    internal metrics that may influence gameplay mechanics such as achievement progression,
    talent point allocation, or reputation gains. The method typically runs during
    periodic updates or when specific skill actions are performed. It ensures that
    engagement data remains consistent with the current state of the player's skill
    profile and game activity.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerSkillProfile* profile = player->GetSkillProfile();

      profile->CalculateEngagement();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the game engine during regular
    update cycles or upon skill activation. Developers should be aware that engagement
    metrics may affect long-term gameplay progression and should not be called excessively
    to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of normal update routines might lead
    to inconsistent state tracking if other systems depend on synchronized engagement
    data. Avoid calling it in high-frequency loops or during critical sections of
    code.
