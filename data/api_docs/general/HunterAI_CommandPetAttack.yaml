  class: HunterAI
  method: CommandPetAttack
  signature: void HunterAI::CommandPetAttack(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Commands the hunter's pet to attack a specified target.
  description: The CommandPetAttack method instructs the hunter's pet to initiate
    an attack against the provided target. This method is typically used within the
    HunterAI class to control pet behavior during combat scenarios. It sets the pet's
    current target and triggers the attack sequence, assuming the pet is capable of
    attacking and the target is valid. The method does not perform any validation
    on the target pointer itself, so it's expected that the caller ensures the target
    is a valid unit.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target unit the pet should attack. Must be a valid
      GameObject or Creature pointer, or nullptr if no target is specified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Attack Command
    code: 'Creature* target = ...; // some creature

      HunterAI* ai = ...; // hunter AI instance

      ai->CommandPetAttack(&target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Pet Target
    code: 'HunterAI* ai = ...; // hunter AI instance

      ai->CommandPetAttack(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly manipulates the pet's AI state and should only be called
    when the pet is in a combat-ready state. It does not check for pet ownership or
    whether the pet is currently under control.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid target pointer may lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the target remains valid throughout the duration of the
    attack command.
