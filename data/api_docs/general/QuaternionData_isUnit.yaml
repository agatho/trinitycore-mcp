documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the quaternion represents a unit quaternion.
  description: The isUnit method determines if the current QuaternionData instance
    represents a unit quaternion, which is a quaternion with a magnitude (norm) of
    1.0. Unit quaternions are essential in 3D graphics and game physics for representing
    rotations without gimbal lock. This method typically compares the squared magnitude
    of the quaternion against a small epsilon value to account for floating-point
    precision errors. The check is important for maintaining numerical stability in
    rotation calculations within TrinityCore's engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: "Returns true if the quaternion is a unit quaternion (magnitude \u2248\
    \ 1.0), false otherwise. This indicates that the quaternion can be used directly\
    \ for rotation operations without normalization."
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate quaternion
    code: "QuaternionData quat(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);\nif (quat.isUnit()) {\n  \
      \  // Quaternion is normalized and suitable for rotation\n    printf(\"Valid\
      \ unit quaternion\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Quaternion needs normalization\n\
      \    printf(\"Quaternion requires normalization\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses a small epsilon value for floating-point comparison to handle
    precision errors. It's recommended to use this check before performing rotation
    operations to ensure numerical stability.
