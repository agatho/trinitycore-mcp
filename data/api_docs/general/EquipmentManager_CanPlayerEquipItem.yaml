  method: CanPlayerEquipItem
  signature: bool EquipmentManager::CanPlayerEquipItem(int * player, const int * itemTemplate)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player can equip a specific item based on requirements such
    as level, class, and inventory constraints.
  description: The CanPlayerEquipItem method evaluates if a given player is eligible
    to equip a specified item. It verifies various conditions including the player's
    level requirement, class restrictions, inventory space availability, and other
    game-specific rules. This method is typically used before allowing an item to
    be equipped to prevent invalid or prohibited equipping actions. The function returns
    true if all checks pass, indicating that the player can legally equip the item;
    otherwise, it returns false. It does not perform the actual equipping action but
    merely validates the conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      or internal reference. This parameter identifies which player is being checked
      for item equipability.
  - name: itemTemplate
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the item template ID or reference.
      This identifies the specific item whose equipability is being evaluated against
      the player's constraints.
  returns: Returns true if the player can legally equip the specified item, considering
    all applicable game rules and restrictions. Returns false if any condition fails,
    such as insufficient level, incorrect class, or lack of inventory space.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player can equip an item
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nint itemId = 67890;\nbool canEquip = EquipmentManager::CanPlayerEquipItem(&playerId,\
      \ &itemId);\nif (canEquip) {\n    // Proceed with equipping the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result in a conditional logic for item equipping
    code: "int* playerPtr = &playerGuid;\nint* itemPtr = &itemTemplateId;\nif (EquipmentManager::CanPlayerEquipItem(playerPtr,\
      \ itemPtr)) {\n    // Equip the item\n    player->EquipItem(itemTemplateId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Send error message to player\n    player->SendEquipError(EQUIP_ERR_ITEM_NOT_FOUND);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core equipment validation system in TrinityCore.
    It may involve database lookups for item and player data, so performance should
    be considered when called frequently. The implementation likely includes checks
    for item class, subclass, inventory type, and character stats.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters point to valid memory locations; passing null
    pointers or invalid IDs can lead to undefined behavior. This method does not account
    for temporary status effects like buffs or debuffs that might affect equipability
    in some cases.
