  method: PlayerPatternRecognition
  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::PlayerPatternRecognition()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PlayerPatternRecognition class for detecting
    and analyzing player behavior patterns.
  description: The PlayerPatternRecognition constructor initializes internal data
    structures used for tracking and recognizing player behavior patterns within the
    TrinityCore environment. This includes setting up pattern databases, initializing
    detection algorithms, and preparing state variables required for real-time analysis
    of player actions such as movement, interaction, and gameplay decisions. The initialization
    process ensures that subsequent calls to pattern recognition methods are properly
    configured and ready for use. This constructor is typically invoked during player
    login or when a new pattern recognition session begins.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PlayerPatternRecognition recognizer;

      // The recognizer is now initialized and ready for pattern analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy computations or I/O operations.
    It primarily sets up internal data structures and configuration variables. The
    actual pattern recognition processing occurs in separate methods like Update()
    or ProcessPlayerAction().
