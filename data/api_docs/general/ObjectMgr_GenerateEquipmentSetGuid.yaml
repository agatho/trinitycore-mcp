  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GenerateEquipmentSetGuid
  signature: uint64 ObjectMgr::GenerateEquipmentSetGuid()
documentation:
  brief: Generates and returns a unique global identifier (GUID) for an equipment
    set within the game world.
  description: The GenerateEquipmentSetGuid method is responsible for creating a unique
    64-bit identifier (GUID) specifically for equipment sets in the TrinityCore database.
    This GUID is used internally by the server to uniquely identify each equipment
    set assigned to players or stored in the database. The method ensures that no
    two equipment sets will have the same GUID, maintaining data integrity across
    the game world. It typically integrates with the global object GUID generation
    system to avoid conflicts with other types of objects such as players, creatures,
    items, etc. This function is generally called when a new equipment set needs to
    be created and stored in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the unique global identifier (GUID) for the
    newly generated equipment set. This GUID is guaranteed to be unique within the
    context of the game world and can be used to reference this specific equipment
    set in database operations or in-memory structures.
  examples:
  - title: Generating a GUID for a new Equipment Set
    code: 'uint64 newSetGuid = sObjectMgr->GenerateEquipmentSetGuid();

      // Use the generated GUID to create a new equipment set entry

      EquipmentSet* newSet = new EquipmentSet();

      newSet->SetGuid(newSetGuid);

      // Further initialization of the equipment set...

      sObjectMgr->AddEquipmentSet(newSet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr class which manages global game object
    identifiers. The GUID generation likely uses a monotonic counter or similar mechanism
    to ensure uniqueness and prevent collisions. It's important to note that this
    function should only be called when actually creating a new equipment set, not
    during lookup or modification operations.
  warnings: Do not call this method unnecessarily as it may impact performance if
    used excessively in tight loops. Also, ensure that the returned GUID is properly
    stored and managed to avoid orphaned entries in the database.
