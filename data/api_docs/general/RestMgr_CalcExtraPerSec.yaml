  brief: Calculates the extra restoration rate per second based on rest type and bubble
    factor
  description: The CalcExtraPerSec method computes the additional amount of resource
    restoration (such as mana or energy) that occurs per second for a given rest type.
    This calculation takes into account a bubble factor which may modify the base
    restoration rate. The method is typically used in the context of player resting
    mechanics, where different rest types (like sitting, sleeping, or resting in a
    city) provide varying levels of resource regeneration. It's part of the RestMgr
    class that manages all aspects of player rest and resource restoration in the
    game.
  parameters:
  - name: restType
    description: The type of rest activity being performed. This enum typically includes
      values such as REST_TYPE_SIT, REST_TYPE_SLEEP, or REST_TYPE_CITY which determine
      how resources are restored.
  - name: bubble
    description: A multiplier factor that modifies the base restoration rate. This
      could represent buffs, debuffs, or other game mechanics that affect how quickly
      resources regenerate during rest.
  returns: Returns a float value representing the extra amount of resource restored
    per second. A positive value indicates additional restoration, while a negative
    value might indicate resource loss (though this is less common for resting mechanics).
    The value can be zero if no extra restoration occurs.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate mana restoration rate during sitting
    code: 'float extraManaPerSec = restMgr.CalcExtraPerSec(REST_TYPE_SIT, 1.0f);

      // Returns the base extra mana restored per second while sitting

      std::cout << "Extra mana per second: " << extraManaPerSec << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate energy restoration with a buff multiplier
    code: 'float bubbleFactor = 1.5f; // 50% bonus from a buff

      float extraEnergyPerSec = restMgr.CalcExtraPerSec(REST_TYPE_SLEEP, bubbleFactor);

      // Returns increased energy restoration per second due to the buff'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the game's resource management system
    to dynamically calculate how fast a player regenerates resources during different
    types of rest. The bubble parameter may be influenced by various factors such
    as player buffs, talents, or environmental effects. It's important to note that
    this calculation might be combined with other factors like character level, class-specific
    multipliers, and gear bonuses.
  warnings: Ensure that the RestTypes enum values passed are valid, as invalid values
    could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect calculations. The bubble parameter
    should typically be a positive value, though negative values may be handled depending
    on implementation details.
