documentation:
  brief: Sets the money amount for the player character.
  description: This method allows developers to directly set the amount of copper
    coins a player possesses. It modifies the player's money field in the character
    database, which affects the player's in-game currency display and can influence
    various game mechanics such as item purchasing and vendor interactions. The method
    is typically used for debugging or game master purposes to quickly adjust player
    money without requiring complex calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting player money to 1000 copper
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetMoney(1000);

      // Player now has 1000 copper coins'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the player's money field in the database without
    any validation checks. It should be used carefully as it bypasses normal game
    mechanics like currency transactions and may cause inconsistencies if not handled
    properly.
  warnings: This method does not validate the input value; setting a very large amount
    could potentially cause overflow issues or unexpected behavior in the game world.
    Also, this method does not account for any existing money that might already be
    present in the player's inventory.
