  method: UpdateAllSessions
  signature: void IBotSessionManager::UpdateAllSessions(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active bot sessions with the specified time delta.
  description: The UpdateAllSessions method iterates through all currently active
    bot sessions managed by the IBotSessionManager and applies necessary updates based
    on the provided time difference. This typically includes processing AI behaviors,
    handling movement updates, managing combat states, and synchronizing session data
    with the game world state. The method is designed to be called regularly from
    the main game loop to ensure that all bot characters remain synchronized with
    the server's current time and game state. It serves as a central coordination
    point for maintaining the consistency and responsiveness of all active bot sessions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    botSessionManager->UpdateAllSessions(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with TrinityCore Update System
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    botSessionManager->UpdateAllSessions(diff);\n\
      \    // ... other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently (typically every game tick) to maintain
    proper bot behavior. The implementation likely uses a time-based delta system
    to ensure consistent AI behavior regardless of frame rate fluctuations. It's important
    that this method does not block the main thread for extended periods as it's called
    within the core game loop.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect or zero time deltas may cause unexpected
    AI behavior or session synchronization issues. Ensure that the diff parameter
    accurately represents the elapsed time since the last call to maintain proper
    bot timing and responsiveness.
