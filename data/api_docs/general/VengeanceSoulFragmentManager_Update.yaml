  brief: Updates the vengeance soul fragment manager's internal state and processes
    pending operations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the state of the VengeanceSoulFragmentManager
    class, which manages soul fragments associated with vengeance effects in World
    of Warcraft. This method typically handles processing queued actions, updating
    timers, checking conditions, and managing the lifecycle of soul fragments within
    the game world. It is called regularly by the game loop to ensure that vengeance-related
    mechanics function correctly and consistently. The method may also handle cleanup
    of expired or unused fragments and synchronization with player states.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'VengeanceSoulFragmentManager* manager = ...;

      manager->Update();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main game update loop and should
    not be called directly in most cases. It's designed to be lightweight but may
    perform several internal checks depending on the current state of vengeance effects.
