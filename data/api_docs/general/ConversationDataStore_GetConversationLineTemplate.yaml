  signature: const ConversationLineTemplate * ConversationDataStore::GetConversationLineTemplate(uint32
    conversationLineId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a conversation line template by its unique identifier from the
    data store.
  description: The GetConversationLineTemplate method fetches a const pointer to a
    ConversationLineTemplate object using a provided conversation line ID. This method
    is used within the TrinityCore framework to access predefined conversation line
    data that defines how NPCs interact with players during dialogue sequences. The
    returned template contains information such as text content, associated creature
    IDs, and timing details for each line in a conversation. It's typically called
    when processing conversation events or building dynamic dialog trees at runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the ConversationLineTemplate object if a valid conversation
    line ID is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching template exists in
    the data store.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ConversationLineTemplate* lineTemplate = sConversationDataStore->GetConversationLineTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (lineTemplate)\n{\n    // Process the conversation line template\n    printf(\"\
      Text: %s\\n\", lineTemplate->Text.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure, likely
    using a hash map or similar container for efficient access. The returned pointer
    is const, meaning the template data should not be modified through this interface.
    Ensure that the conversation line ID passed to this method corresponds to valid
    entries in the database.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent conversationLineId
    will result in a nullptr return value. Always check for null before dereferencing
    the returned pointer to prevent crashes. Also, be aware that templates retrieved
    from this store may be shared across multiple conversations and should not be
    modified directly.
