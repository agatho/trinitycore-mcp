documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes movement actions for an AI-controlled unit
  description: The CreateMovementActions method is responsible for generating and
    setting up all movement-related actions that an AI-controlled unit can perform.
    This includes pathfinding, waypoint following, fleeing behaviors, and other locomotion-based
    AI actions. The method typically gets called during AI initialization or when
    the unit's movement state changes. It evaluates the current context of the unit
    such as its position, target location, environment, and threat level to determine
    which movement actions should be active. This method is crucial for proper AI
    behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, ensuring that NPCs move
    realistically and respond appropriately to their surroundings.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of action
    creation. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful completion, while
    non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid unit state,
    missing pathfinding data, or allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI initialization
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeAI() override\
      \ {\n        if (ActionFactory::CreateMovementActions() != 0) {\n          \
      \  // Handle error case\n            sLog->outError(\"Failed to create movement\
      \ actions for creature %u\", me->GetEntry());\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization and may be invoked
    multiple times throughout a creature's lifecycle when movement behavior needs
    to be recalculated. The implementation likely interacts with the underlying pathfinding
    system and movement manager components. Developers should ensure that the unit
    has valid positioning data before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method on a unit without proper AI context or uninitialized
    movement components may lead to undefined behavior. The method assumes that the
    associated creature or unit is in a valid state for movement action creation.
    Repeated calls without proper cleanup may cause memory leaks or inconsistent AI
    states.
