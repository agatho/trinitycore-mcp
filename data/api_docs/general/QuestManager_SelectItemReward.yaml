documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the item reward ID from a quest based on player's selection
    criteria
  description: The SelectItemReward method determines which item reward to provide
    to a player for a given quest. It evaluates the quest's item rewards and selects
    one based on internal logic, typically considering player requirements, quest
    state, and reward distribution rules. This method is commonly used during quest
    completion when the player must choose an item from multiple possible rewards.
    The returned value represents the item entry ID that should be awarded to the
    player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the item entry ID of the selected reward.
    A value of 0 indicates no valid reward was selected or the quest has no item rewards
    available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion
    code: "uint32 itemId = player->GetQuestStatus(12345)->SelectItemReward(quest);\n\
      if (itemId > 0)\n{\n    player->AddItem(itemId, 1);\n    // Process item reward\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the quest system when processing
    quest completion. It may consider factors such as player level, faction, and existing
    inventory to determine appropriate rewards. The selection logic might be influenced
    by quest flags or reward distribution settings in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest parameter passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Calling with an invalid quest pointer can lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method should only be called during active quest processing,
    not during quest initialization or cleanup phases.
