  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: CalculateObjectivePriorities
  signature: int ObjectiveTracker::CalculateObjectivePriorities(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and assigns priority levels to player objectives within the objective
    tracker system.
  description: The CalculateObjectivePriorities method determines the relative importance
    of various objectives assigned to a player character, typically used in quest
    management and objective tracking systems. This method evaluates each active objective
    based on criteria such as quest type, completion status, time sensitivity, and
    player progression. It assigns numerical priority values that influence how objectives
    are displayed and processed by the game client. The method is commonly invoked
    during player login, quest updates, or when new objectives become available. It
    ensures that important or time-sensitive objectives are prioritized for display
    and completion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose objectives need priority calculation.
      This parameter represents the target character for which objective priorities
      will be determined.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the total number of objectives that
    had their priorities recalculated. A return value of zero indicates no objectives
    were processed, while positive values indicate the count of updated objectives.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      int priorityCount = objectiveTracker->CalculateObjectivePriorities(player);

      // priorityCount now contains number of objectives with recalculated priorities'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest System
    code: "void UpdatePlayerObjectives(Player* player)\n{\n    ObjectiveTracker* tracker\
      \ = player->GetObjectiveTracker();\n    if (tracker)\n    {\n        int updatedCount\
      \ = tracker->CalculateObjectivePriorities(player);\n        if (updatedCount\
      \ > 0)\n        {\n            // Notify client of updated objectives\n    \
      \        player->SendUpdateWorldState(PLAYER_OBJECTIVE_UPDATE, updatedCount);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during critical game state transitions such
    as login, quest acceptance, or when objective states change. The priority calculation
    logic may vary based on the specific implementation of the objective tracker and
    can be influenced by player level, faction, and current quest progression. Performance-wise,
    this operation should be lightweight since it's designed to handle multiple objectives
    efficiently.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. The
    method modifies internal objective state, so calling it during active quest processing
    might cause race conditions if not properly synchronized.
