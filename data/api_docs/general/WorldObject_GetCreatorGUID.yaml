  class: WorldObject
  method: GetCreatorGUID
  signature: ObjectGuid WorldObject::GetCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the object's creator, typically used for determining
    ownership or origin of game objects.
  description: The GetCreatorGUID method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the entity that created or spawned the current WorldObject. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft to track the source of creatures, game objects, or other
    entities that have a creator. The method returns an ObjectGuid which represents
    the GUID of the creator, and can be used for various game mechanics including
    tracking ownership, determining spawn sources, or identifying the original creator
    of an object. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to
    understand the relationship between different objects in the game world, such
    as when a creature was spawned by a player or another NPC.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the ObjectGuid representing the GUID of the creator. If no creator
    exists, this will return a null GUID (0).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "WorldObject* obj = new WorldObject();\nObjectGuid creatorGUID = obj->GetCreatorGUID();\n\
      if (creatorGUID != NULL)\n{\n    // Do something with the creator GUID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special handling. It
    is commonly used in TrinityCore's core codebase for tracking object creation sources,
    especially in creature and game object spawn logic.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when dealing with objects that may
    not have a creator, as returning NULL GUID can lead to incorrect assumptions about
    ownership or origin. Always verify the validity of the returned GUID before using
    it in logic.
