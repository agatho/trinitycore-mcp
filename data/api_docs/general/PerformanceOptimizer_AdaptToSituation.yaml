  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: AdaptToSituation
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::AdaptToSituation(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & situation)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts bot behavior based on the specified situation and GUID
  description: The AdaptToSituation method modifies the performance optimization strategy
    for a specific bot identified by its GUID, according to the provided situational
    context. This method is typically used in AI-driven bot systems within TrinityCore
    to dynamically adjust behaviors such as resource allocation, decision-making processes,
    or action prioritization based on real-time game conditions. The situation parameter
    defines the current context which could include combat states, player proximity,
    environmental factors, or mission objectives. This allows for adaptive performance
    tuning that maximizes efficiency and responsiveness under varying circumstances.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose behavior needs to be adjusted.
      Must correspond to a valid active bot in the system.
  - name: situation
    description: String describing the current game situation or context that determines
      how the bot should adapt its performance strategy. Examples include "combat",
      "exploration", "quest", "pvp", or custom-defined states.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.AdaptToSituation(12345, "combat");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adapting for Different Situations
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      optimizer.AdaptToSituation(botId, "exploration");

      optimizer.AdaptToSituation(botId, "pvp");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI subsystem and may involve internal
    state tracking for each bot. It's designed to be called frequently during gameplay
    updates to ensure optimal performance adaptation without significant overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot; otherwise,
    behavior is undefined. The situation string should match predefined valid contexts
    or risk unexpected performance adjustments.
