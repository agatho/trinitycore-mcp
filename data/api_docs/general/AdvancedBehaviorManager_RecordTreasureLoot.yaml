  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: RecordTreasureLoot
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::RecordTreasureLoot(GameObject * treasure)
documentation:
  brief: Records loot data from a treasure GameObject for advanced behavior tracking
    and logging.
  description: The RecordTreasureLoot method captures and logs information about loot
    obtained from a treasure GameObject within the TrinityCore framework. This functionality
    is typically used in custom AI behaviors or quest systems where tracking specific
    loot drops from treasures is required. The method likely stores metadata such
    as item IDs, quantities, player GUIDs, and timestamps to enable post-processing
    or reward distribution logic. It may also update internal state machines or trigger
    additional events based on the recorded loot data.
  parameters:
  - name: treasure
    description: Pointer to the GameObject representing the treasure from which loot
      is being recorded. Must be a valid GameObject instance of type treasure (e.g.,
      a chest or container). The object must be in an active state and contain valid
      loot data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Custom AI
    code: "void MyCustomAI::OnCreatureKilled(Unit* killer, Unit* killed) {\n    if\
      \ (GameObject* treasure = GetNearbyTreasure()) {\n        m_behaviorManager->RecordTreasureLoot(treasure);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Completion
    code: "void QuestHandler::OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\
      \ {\n    if (GameObject* treasure = player->GetGameObjectAtMap(player->GetPosition(),\
      \ 12345)) {\n        m_behaviorManager->RecordTreasureLoot(treasure);\n    \
      \    // Additional logic to process recorded loot\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger behavior management system that tracks
    player interactions with game objects. Ensure the treasure GameObject is properly
    initialized and contains valid loot data before calling this method. The implementation
    may involve database writes or internal logging structures that could impact performance
    if called excessively.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid or uninitialized GameObject pointer
    will likely result in a crash or undefined behavior. Always validate the treasure
    parameter before invoking RecordTreasureLoot.
