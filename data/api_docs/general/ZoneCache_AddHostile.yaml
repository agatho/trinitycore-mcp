documentation:
  brief: Adds a hostile unit to the zone cache for tracking and threat management.
  description: The AddHostile method registers a Unit object as a hostile entity within
    the ZoneCache system. This allows the game's AI and combat systems to properly
    track enemy units within the same zone, enabling threat calculations, aggro management,
    and proper targeting behavior. The method typically updates internal data structures
    that maintain lists of hostile units in the zone, ensuring that the unit is included
    in relevant combat-related operations and visibility checks.

  examples:
  - title: Adding a Hostile Unit to Zone Cache
    code: 'Unit* enemy = ...; // Some hostile unit

      ZoneCache* zoneCache = player->GetZoneCache();

      zoneCache->AddHostile(enemy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a Unit
    becomes hostile to the player or another unit within the same zone. It may trigger
    updates to the zone's threat list and visibility calculations.
