  method: GetEnchantmentDuration
  signature: uint32 Item::GetEnchantmentDuration(EnchantmentSlot slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the duration of an enchantment applied to an item.
  description: This method returns the remaining duration in seconds of an enchantment
    applied to the specified item. The enchantment is identified by its slot, which
    corresponds to one of the item's enchantment slots. The method is commonly used
    to determine how long an enchantment will remain active on an item, particularly
    for temporary enchantments such as those found on weapons or armor. This functionality
    is essential for game mechanics involving item enchantments and their expiration
    times.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the duration in seconds of the enchantment applied to the item.
    If no enchantment exists in the specified slot, the method returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 duration = item->GetEnchantmentDuration(EnchantmentSlot::ENCHANTMENT_SLOT_0);\n\
      if (duration > 0)\n{\n    // Handle active enchantment\n    std::cout << \"\
      Enchantment duration: \" << duration << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related functions
    to manage enchantment expiration and gameplay mechanics. It's important to note
    that the returned value may be zero if no enchantment exists in the slot, which
    can happen when items are not enchanted or when an enchantment has expired.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not validate whether the enchantment actually
    exists in the slot; it simply returns the duration as stored in the item's data.
    If the item is not properly initialized or if the enchantment slot is invalid,
    the result may be misleading or incorrect.
