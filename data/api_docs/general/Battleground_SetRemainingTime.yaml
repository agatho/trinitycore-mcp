  class: Battleground
  method: SetRemainingTime
  signature: void Battleground::SetRemainingTime(int Time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the remaining time for the battleground.
  description: The SetRemainingTime method updates the internal timer of a battleground,
    typically used to control the duration of the match or to trigger events based
    on time limits. This method is commonly invoked during battleground start-up,
    when time extensions are needed, or when specific game mechanics require altering
    the countdown. The time value passed in seconds will be applied to the battleground's
    internal clock, affecting player experience and game state transitions such as
    victory conditions or respawn timers.
  parameters:
  - name: Time
    description: The new remaining time for the battleground in seconds. Must be a
      non-negative integer representing the duration left before the battleground
      ends or triggers its next event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Initial Countdown
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(1234);

      bg->SetRemainingTime(300); // Sets 5-minute countdown'
    language: cpp
  - title: Extending Time Due to Event
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(5678);

      bg->SetRemainingTime(bg->GetRemainingTime() + 60); // Adds one minute to current
      time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the battleground's internal timer state and
    should be used carefully to avoid disrupting game balance or timing logic. It
    does not broadcast changes to players automatically; you may need to call additional
    methods like SendPacketToAll() if visual updates are required.
  warnings: Modifying the remaining time during active gameplay can cause inconsistencies
    in player experience or unexpected behavior if not synchronized with other systems
    such as scoring, respawn timers, or win conditions. Avoid setting negative values
    as they might lead to undefined behavior.
