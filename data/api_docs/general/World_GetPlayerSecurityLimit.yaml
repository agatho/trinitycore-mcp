  class: World
  method: GetPlayerSecurityLimit
  signature: AccountTypes World::GetPlayerSecurityLimit() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum security level of players that can be interacted with
    by this world instance.
  description: The GetPlayerSecurityLimit method retrieves the highest account security
    level that is allowed to interact with players in the current world context. This
    value is typically used to enforce access control and prevent lower-privileged
    accounts from performing actions on higher-privileged players. The returned AccountTypes
    value represents the upper boundary for player interaction permissions within
    the game world. This method does not take any parameters and returns a constant
    value based on the server's configuration and operational mode.
  parameters: []
  returns: An AccountTypes enumeration value indicating the maximum security level
    allowed for player interactions in this world instance. This typically corresponds
    to a minimum security level such as GM_LEVEL_PLAYER or higher, depending on the
    server's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check Player Interaction Limit
    code: "AccountTypes limit = sWorld->GetPlayerSecurityLimit();\nif (limit >= SEC_ADMINISTRATOR)\n\
      {\n    // Allow administrative actions\n    sLog->outString(\"Administrator\
      \ access granted.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when checking
    permissions for player interactions. The returned value may be cached or computed
    once per server session, and it's important to note that this limit affects both
    incoming and outgoing player interactions within the world context.
  warnings: Do not use this value directly for access control without verifying against
    actual account security levels. The returned value represents a maximum limit,
    not necessarily an active restriction, so additional checks may be required in
    complex permission systems.
