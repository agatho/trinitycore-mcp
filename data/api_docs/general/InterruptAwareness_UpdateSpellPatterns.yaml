    & cast)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal spell pattern recognition based on a detected spell cast.
  description: The UpdateSpellPatterns method processes a detected spell cast to update
    the interrupt awareness system's internal state. This method is typically invoked
    when a spell cast is detected by the AI or game engine, allowing the system to
    maintain an up-to-date understanding of ongoing spell casts that may require interruption.
    It handles pattern matching and state updates for spell interruption logic, which
    is crucial for AI behavior in combat scenarios where timing and awareness of enemy
    spells are important. The method does not return any value but modifies internal
    data structures used for interrupt decision-making.
  parameters:
  - name: cast
    description: A reference to a DetectedSpellCast object containing information
      about the detected spell cast, including spell ID, caster, target, and timing
      data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void EnemyAI::Update()\n{\n    if (auto detectedCast = GetDetectedSpellCast())\n\
      \    {\n        interruptAwareness.UpdateSpellPatterns(*detectedCast);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell detection system
    code: "void SpellDetectionSystem::OnSpellCastDetected(DetectedSpellCast& cast)\n\
      {\n    // Update interrupt awareness with new spell data\n    interruptAwareness.UpdateSpellPatterns(cast);\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger interrupt logic if necessary\n    if (interruptAwareness.ShouldInterrupt())\n\
      \    {\n        PerformInterruptAction();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the interrupt awareness system that helps AI characters
    make decisions about when to interrupt enemy spell casts. It's designed to be
    called from within combat update loops or spell detection callbacks. The internal
    pattern matching logic may cache recent spell data for performance optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the DetectedSpellCast object passed to this method is valid
    and fully initialized before calling. Passing an invalid or uninitialized cast
    could lead to undefined behavior in the interrupt awareness system.
