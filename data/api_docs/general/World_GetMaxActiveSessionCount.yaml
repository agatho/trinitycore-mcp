  signature: uint32 World::GetMaxActiveSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of active player sessions allowed on the server
  description: The GetMaxActiveSessionCount method retrieves the configured limit
    for concurrent active player sessions that the World server will allow. This value
    is typically set via the configuration file or command line arguments and represents
    the upper bound of players that can be actively logged in and playing simultaneously.
    The method provides read-only access to this server-wide setting, which is used
    internally by the authentication and session management systems to enforce connection
    limits. This value may be adjusted dynamically during runtime but affects new
    connections rather than existing ones.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of active player sessions
    allowed on the server at any given time
  examples:
  - title: Check Maximum Active Sessions
    code: 'uint32 maxSessions = sWorld->GetMaxActiveSessionCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, "Maximum active sessions: %u", maxSessions);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Enforce Session Limit in Custom Code
    code: "uint32 currentActive = sWorld->GetActiveSessionCount();\nuint32 maxActive\
      \ = sWorld->GetMaxActiveSessionCount();\nif (currentActive >= maxActive)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle session limit reached\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"\
      Session limit reached. Cannot accept new connections.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a cached value that reflects the server configuration
    and does not account for dynamic changes made during runtime without explicit
    reloads. The returned value is typically initialized from server configuration
    settings such as 'MaxActiveSessions' or similar parameters.
  warnings: The returned value represents a hard limit enforced by the server configuration,
    not a real-time count of active sessions. If you are checking this value to make
    decisions about new connections, ensure that your logic accounts for potential
    race conditions during session creation.
