  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetRequiredSkillRank() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the required skill rank needed to use the item.
  description: The GetRequiredSkillRank method retrieves the minimum skill level required
    for a character to properly use or equip the item. This value is typically defined
    in the item's template data within the game database and corresponds to a specific
    skill type, such as Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, or Enchanting. When a player
    attempts to use an item that requires a certain skill, this method is used to
    determine if the player's skill level meets or exceeds the threshold. If the player's
    skill is insufficient, they may be unable to use the item or may receive a warning
    message.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the minimum skill rank required to use the
    item. A return value of 0 typically indicates that no skill requirement exists
    for using this item.
  examples:
  - title: Check if player can use an item based on skill requirement
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nuint32\
      \ requiredSkillRank = itemTemplate->GetRequiredSkillRank();\nif (requiredSkillRank\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    uint32 playerSkill = player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_BLACKSMITHING);\
      \ // Example skill\n    if (playerSkill < requiredSkillRank)\n    {\n      \
      \  // Player cannot use the item\n        player->SendNotification(\"You need\
      \ at least %u skill in Blacksmithing to use this item.\", requiredSkillRank);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses data stored in the ItemTemplate structure, which is
    loaded from the game database during server startup. The returned value corresponds
    directly to the 'RequiredSkillRank' field in the 'item_template' table of the
    database.
  warnings: Ensure that the item template being queried is valid before calling this
    method, as accessing an invalid pointer may result in undefined behavior. Also
    note that skill requirements are often tied to specific skill types; make sure
    you're checking against the correct skill type for the item.
