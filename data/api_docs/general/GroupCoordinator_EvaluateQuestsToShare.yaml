api:
  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: EvaluateQuestsToShare
  signature: int GroupCoordinator::EvaluateQuestsToShare() const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the number of quests available for sharing within the
    group.
  description: The EvaluateQuestsToShare method determines how many quests in the
    group's quest log are eligible for sharing with other group members. This method
    is typically used during group coordination to identify which quests can be shared,
    ensuring that players do not duplicate effort or miss opportunities to assist
    each other. The evaluation considers factors such as quest completion status,
    quest availability, and group member requirements. It does not modify any state
    but returns a count of quests that meet the sharing criteria.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of quests in the group's quest log that
    are eligible for sharing with other members. Returns 0 if no quests are available
    for sharing or if the group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int questsToShare = groupCoordinator->EvaluateQuestsToShare();\nif (questsToShare\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest sharing logic\n    std::cout << \"Found\
      \ \" << questsToShare << \" quests to share.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called in the context of group coordination and
    may be used before initiating a quest sharing operation. It does not perform actual
    quest sharing, but rather evaluates what can be shared. The method assumes that
    the GroupCoordinator object has a valid group context.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupCoordinator instance is properly initialized with
    a valid group before calling this method. Calling this method on an invalid or
    uninitialized group may result in unexpected behavior or incorrect counts.
