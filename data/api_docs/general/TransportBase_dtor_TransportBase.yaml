documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TransportBase object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the TransportBase class is responsible for cleaning
    up all resources allocated during the transport's lifetime. This includes releasing
    memory, removing references to associated game objects, and ensuring proper cleanup
    of any transport-related data structures. In the context of TrinityCore's World
    of Warcraft emulation, this destructor ensures that when a transport (such as
    a boat or zeppelin) is removed from the world, all its internal state is properly
    disposed of to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability. The destructor
    is automatically invoked when a TransportBase object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'TransportBase* transport = new TransportBase();

      // ... use the transport ...

      delete transport; // This calls ~TransportBase()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The TransportBase destructor may perform cleanup
    operations that depend on the transport's current state, such as removing passengers
    from the transport or notifying the game world of the transport's removal.
