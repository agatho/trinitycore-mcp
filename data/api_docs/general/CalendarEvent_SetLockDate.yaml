  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetLockDate
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetLockDate(time_t lockDate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the lock date for a calendar event, preventing further modifications
    to the event's date and time.
  description: The SetLockDate method assigns a specific timestamp to the calendar
    event's lock date. Once set, this date typically prevents modifications to the
    event's start time or other time-related properties. This mechanism is used in
    World of Warcraft's calendar system to ensure that certain events cannot be altered
    after a specified point, maintaining event integrity and preventing last-minute
    changes that might disrupt player planning. The lock date is usually set based
    on game rules or administrative decisions, such as when an event approaches its
    start time or when it has been confirmed by the event organizer.
  parameters:
  - name: lockDate
    description: The timestamp representing the date and time when the calendar event
      becomes locked. This value is typically a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch)
      indicating when modifications should no longer be allowed for the event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a lock date for an event
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = new CalendarEvent();

      // Set lock date to 2 hours from now

      uint32 lockTime = time(nullptr) + 7200;

      event->SetLockDate(lockTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Locking an event at a specific future time
    code: '#include <ctime>

      CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);

      time_t now = time(nullptr);

      time_t lockTime = now + (60 * 60 * 24); // Lock in 24 hours

      event->SetLockDate(lockTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The lock date is typically used to prevent changes to events that are approaching
    their start time. This method may be called internally by the calendar system
    or by game administrators. It's important to note that setting a lock date does
    not automatically validate whether the event has already started, which should
    be handled separately in application logic.
  warnings: Setting an incorrect lock date (e.g., a past timestamp) could cause unexpected
    behavior in the calendar system. Ensure that the lock date is set appropriately
    and that it aligns with game rules regarding event modification windows. Also,
    consider that some events might not support locking at all depending on their
    type or status.
