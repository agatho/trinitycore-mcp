  method: RecordHyperparameters
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::RecordHyperparameters(uint32_t botGuid, const
    std::unordered_map<std::string, float> & params)
documentation:
  brief: Records hyperparameters for a bot in the learning analytics system.
  description: The RecordHyperparameters method stores a set of hyperparameter values
    associated with a specific bot identified by its GUID. This functionality is used
    within the TrinityCore AI learning framework to track and persist configuration
    settings that influence bot behavior during training or operation. The method
    accepts a map of string keys to float values representing various configurable
    parameters, allowing for flexible tracking of different aspects of bot performance
    tuning.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose hyperparameters are being
      recorded. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: params
    description: Map containing string keys and float values representing the hyperparameters
      to be stored. Keys typically represent parameter names, while values represent
      their current settings.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: LearningAnalytics::RecordHyperparameters(12345, {{"learning_rate", 0.001f},
      {"epsilon", 0.01f}});
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Parameters
    code: 'std::unordered_map<std::string, float> hyperparams;

      hyperparams["gamma"] = 0.95f;

      hyperparams["alpha"] = 0.1f;

      hyperparams["beta"] = 0.001f;

      LearningAnalytics::RecordHyperparameters(botGuid, hyperparams);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other learning analytics
    functions to build a complete picture of bot performance over time. The data stored
    may be persisted to database or used for real-time analysis within the AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid corresponds to an active bot; otherwise, the recording
    operation might fail silently or produce unexpected results. Avoid using excessively
    large parameter sets as this could impact performance.
