  signature: int BugTicket::FormatViewMessageString(ChatHandler & handler, bool detailed)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Formats and sends a detailed bug ticket view message to the specified chat
    handler.
  description: The FormatViewMessageString method constructs a formatted string representation
    of a bug ticket, including relevant details such as ticket ID, submitter information,
    bug type, and description. It is typically used when displaying or logging bug
    reports within the game's administrative interface. The method supports both basic
    and detailed output modes depending on the 'detailed' parameter. This function
    interacts with the ChatHandler to send the formatted message to the appropriate
    recipient or log channel. The method returns an integer indicating success or
    failure of the formatting operation.
  parameters:
  - name: handler
    description: Reference to the ChatHandler object used to send the formatted message
      to the client or log system.
  - name: detailed
    description: Boolean flag that determines whether to include detailed information
      about the bug ticket. When true, additional metadata and full description are
      included; when false, only basic ticket information is displayed.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the formatting
    operation. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while non-zero values
    may indicate errors during message formatting or sending.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BugTicket ticket;\n// Assume ticket has been initialized with data\nint\
      \ result = ticket.FormatViewMessageString(handler, false);\nif (result == 0)\
      \ {\n    // Message successfully formatted and sent\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Detailed View
    code: "BugTicket ticket;\n// Assume ticket has been initialized with data\nint\
      \ result = ticket.FormatViewMessageString(handler, true);\nif (result == 0)\
      \ {\n    // Detailed message including full bug report sent to handler\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the BugTicket object and assumes
    that all required fields have been properly initialized before calling. The ChatHandler
    must be valid and capable of receiving messages for this function to operate correctly.
  warnings: Ensure that the BugTicket object is fully initialized before calling this
    method, as accessing uninitialized data may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    message formatting. Also, improper handling of the ChatHandler reference can cause
    runtime errors.
