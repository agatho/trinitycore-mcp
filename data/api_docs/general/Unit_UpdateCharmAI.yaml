  brief: Updates the AI behavior for charm-controlled units
  description: This method updates the artificial intelligence behavior for units
    that are under charm control, typically used in scenarios where a player or NPC
    is controlling another creature through charm effects. The method ensures that
    the charm AI logic is properly executed and maintained during the charm state.
    This function is crucial for maintaining proper AI behavior when a unit is controlled
    by an external entity, such as a player or another creature.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "void UpdateCharmAI() {\n    // This method is called when a unit is under\
      \ charm control\n    // Implementation handles AI updates for controlled units\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the update loop of controlled units,
    ensuring that charm AI logic remains active. Performance considerations include
    maintaining proper timing and avoiding excessive CPU usage during AI updates.
  warnings: Improper handling of charm AI can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs
    in the game mechanics, particularly when dealing with player-controlled creatures.
    Care should be taken to ensure that the method is called only when necessary.
