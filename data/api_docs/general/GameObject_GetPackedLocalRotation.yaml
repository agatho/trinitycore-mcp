documentation:
  brief: Returns the packed local rotation values of the GameObject
  description: This method retrieves the packed local rotation data of a GameObject,
    which represents the orientation of the object in 3D space. The packed rotation
    is typically stored as a 64-bit integer that encodes the X, Y, and Z rotation
    components using bit manipulation techniques. This value is used by the game engine
    to efficiently store and retrieve rotation information without requiring additional
    memory or processing overhead. The method is commonly used in game mechanics related
    to object positioning and orientation handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a 64-bit integer representing the packed local rotation values.
    This value encodes the X, Y, and Z rotation components using bit manipulation,
    where each component is typically stored as 11 bits of data within the larger
    64-bit integer structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      int64 rotation = go->GetPackedLocalRotation();

      // rotation now contains the packed rotation data'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to be thread-safe and does not require any synchronization.
    It directly returns the stored packed rotation value without performing any additional
    calculations or conversions, making it efficient for frequent use in game logic.
  warnings: Care should be taken when interpreting the returned value as it represents
    a packed data structure. The actual rotation values must be decoded using appropriate
    bit manipulation techniques to extract meaningful orientation information. Incorrect
    interpretation can lead to incorrect object orientation handling.
