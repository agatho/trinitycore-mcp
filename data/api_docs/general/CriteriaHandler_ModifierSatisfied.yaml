  signature: bool CriteriaHandler::ModifierSatisfied(const ModifierTreeEntry * modifier,
    uint64 miscValue1, uint64 miscValue2, const WorldObject * ref, Player * referencePlayer)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a criteria modifier is satisfied based on provided values and references.
  description: The ModifierSatisfied method evaluates whether a given criteria modifier
    condition is met by comparing the provided miscellaneous values against the modifier's
    requirements. This function plays a key role in the achievement and criterion
    system of TrinityCore, where various conditions must be validated to determine
    if a player has fulfilled a specific requirement. The method takes into account
    reference objects and player context to ensure accurate evaluation of complex
    criteria logic.
  parameters:
  - name: modifier
    description: Pointer to the ModifierTreeEntry structure defining the criteria
      modifier condition to evaluate. Must not be null.
  - name: miscValue1
    description: First miscellaneous value used for comparison in the modifier evaluation.
      Often represents a quantity, type, or identifier.
  - name: miscValue2
    description: Second miscellaneous value used for comparison in the modifier evaluation.
      Typically used alongside miscValue1 for more complex conditions.
  - name: ref
    description: Pointer to a WorldObject that serves as a reference point for the
      criteria evaluation. Can be null if not required by the modifier.
  - name: referencePlayer
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player context for
      this evaluation. Must not be null for player-specific criteria.
  returns: Returns true if the modifier condition is satisfied with the provided inputs,
    false otherwise. The result depends on internal logic that compares miscValue1
    and miscValue2 against the modifier's defined requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for checking a simple modifier
    code: "if (criteriaHandler.ModifierSatisfied(modifierEntry, 5, 0, nullptr, player))\
      \ {\n    // Criteria modifier satisfied\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with reference object and player context
    code: "Creature* targetCreature = ...;\nif (criteriaHandler.ModifierSatisfied(modifierEntry,\
      \ 10, 20, targetCreature, player)) {\n    // Criteria satisfied with creature\
      \ reference\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core achievement and criterion evaluation system
    in TrinityCore. It's commonly invoked during event handling or when checking progress
    towards achievements. The modifier entry structure contains the logic for how
    values should be compared, including operators like equal, greater than, less
    than, etc.
  warnings: Ensure that the referencePlayer parameter is not null as it may cause
    undefined behavior if used in player-specific criteria checks. Also, make sure
    the modifier pointer is valid to avoid crashes during evaluation.
