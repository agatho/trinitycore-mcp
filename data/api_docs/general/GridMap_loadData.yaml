  class: GridMap
  method: loadData
  signature: LoadResult GridMap::loadData(const char * filename)
documentation:
  brief: Loads map data from a specified file into the GridMap instance.
  description: The loadData method initializes and loads terrain and map data for
    a specific grid cell from a file. This method is typically used during world initialization
    or when a player enters a new grid area. It reads the necessary map data structures,
    including height maps, liquid data, and tile information, to enable proper collision
    detection, pathfinding, and rendering for that grid. The method ensures that all
    required map resources are loaded before the grid becomes active in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a LoadResult enum indicating the success or failure of the loading
    operation. Possible values include LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS, LOAD_RESULT_ERROR, and
    LOAD_RESULT_ALREADY_LOADED depending on whether the data was successfully loaded,
    encountered an error during loading, or was already present in memory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Data Loading
    code: "GridMap map;\nLoadResult result = map.loadData(\"maps/0_0_0.map\");\nif\
      \ (result == LOAD_RESULT_SUCCESS) {\n    // Map data loaded successfully\n \
      \   printf(\"Map loaded successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle loading\
      \ error\n    printf(\"Failed to load map: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when a new grid
    area needs to be initialized. The filename parameter should point to a valid .map
    file in the game's data directory structure. Loading may block the calling thread
    until completion, so it's recommended to perform this operation asynchronously
    for better performance in large worlds.
  warnings: Calling loadData on an already loaded grid map will result in a LOAD_RESULT_ALREADY_LOADED
    return value and will not reload the data. Ensure proper error handling for cases
    where map files might be missing or corrupted. This method does not validate file
    integrity beyond basic loading, so corrupted map files could cause unexpected
    behavior.
