  class: InteractionManager
  method: HasGossipOption
  signature: bool InteractionManager::HasGossipOption(Creature * npc, uint32 option)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a creature has a specific gossip option available.
  description: The HasGossipOption method determines whether a given NPC (Creature)
    contains a specific gossip option identified by its unique option ID. This functionality
    is commonly used within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to manage interactive
    dialogue trees and ensure that only valid options are presented to players during
    gossip interactions. The method performs a lookup in the creature's gossip menu
    data structure to verify the existence of the specified option before returning
    a boolean result. It is typically called during gossip processing to validate
    user selections or to conditionally display options based on player state or quest
    progress.
  parameters:
  - name: npc
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC whose gossip
      options are being checked. Must not be null for valid operation.
  - name: option
    description: The unique identifier (uint32) of the gossip option to check for
      existence within the creature's gossip menu. This ID corresponds to a specific
      entry in the gossip menu configuration.
  returns: Returns true if the specified gossip option exists for the given NPC; otherwise,
    returns false. A return value of false typically indicates that either the option
    ID is invalid or the NPC does not have this particular option configured in its
    gossip menu.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Gossip Option
    code: "if (interactionManager.HasGossipOption(npc, 12345)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ handling the gossip option\n    player->ADD_GOSSIP_ITEM(GOSSIP_ICON_CHAT,\
      \ \"Selected Option\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Gossip Option Display
    code: "if (!interactionManager.HasGossipOption(npc, 98765)) {\n    // Add the\
      \ option only if it doesn't already exist\n    npc->AddGossipItem(98765, \"\
      Special Quest\", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, 98765);\n}\nif (interactionManager.HasGossipOption(npc,\
      \ 98765)) {\n    // Perform action when option exists\n    player->PlayerTalkClass->SendGossipMenu(10001,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal gossip menu data structures and should be
    used carefully in performance-sensitive contexts. The method assumes that the
    NPC pointer is valid and that the gossip options have been properly initialized.
    It does not perform any validation of the option ID itself, so invalid IDs may
    return false without error.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, be aware that gossip options are typically managed through database entries
    or scripted configurations, so relying on hardcoded option IDs may lead to inconsistencies
    if those values change.
