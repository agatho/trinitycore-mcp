  class: WarriorAI
  method: CalculateOptimalChargePosition
  signature: int WarriorAI::CalculateOptimalChargePosition(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal charge position relative to the target unit for a
    warrior's charge ability.
  description: The CalculateOptimalChargePosition method determines the best location
    for a warrior to begin a charge attack against a specified target. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as distance, target movement, and combat
    positioning to ensure maximum effectiveness of the charge ability. The method
    returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal position, which can
    be used by the AI to guide the warrior's movement during combat. This functionality
    is crucial for proper execution of warrior abilities in TrinityCore's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the optimal charge position. The
    specific meaning of this value depends on the internal coordinate system used
    by the AI, typically indicating a relative distance or angle from the target unit
    that maximizes the effectiveness of the charge ability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Warrior AI
    code: "void WarriorAI::ExecuteCharge()\n{\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n \
      \   if (target)\n    {\n        int optimalPosition = CalculateOptimalChargePosition(target);\n\
      \        // Use optimalPosition to determine movement path\n        MoveTo(target,\
      \ optimalPosition);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior AI subsystem and should only be called
    when a valid target exists. The calculation may involve complex pathfinding logic
    and distance computations that could impact performance in high-density combat
    scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes that a valid target unit exists and may produce undefined
    behavior if called without a proper target. Additionally, since this is an AI
    calculation, results may vary based on the specific implementation of the warrior's
    combat logic.
