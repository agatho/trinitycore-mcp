  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: BroadcastInstanceInformation
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::BroadcastInstanceInformation(Group * group,
    const std::string & message)
documentation:
  brief: Broadcasts instance information to all members of a group.
  description: The BroadcastInstanceInformation method sends a specified message containing
    instance-related data to all players within a given group. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to
    synchronize instance state, such as boss encounter statuses, loot information,
    or other dynamic gameplay elements across group members. The method ensures that
    all players in the group receive consistent and timely updates about the current
    instance conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members who will receive
      the broadcast message. Must be a valid group pointer; null pointers will result
      in undefined behavior.
  - name: message
    description: String containing the instance information to be broadcasted to all
      group members. This can include formatted data such as encounter status, loot
      rolls, or other instance-specific updates.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcast Boss Encounter Status
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n    std::string\
      \ statusMessage = \"Boss Gruul has been defeated! Loot roll started.\";\n  \
      \  instanceCoordination->BroadcastInstanceInformation(raidGroup, statusMessage);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Send Dynamic Instance Update
    code: "Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (dungeonGroup && dungeonGroup->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    std::ostringstream oss;\n    oss << \"Instance reset in 30 seconds. Current\
      \ progress: \" << currentProgress << \"%\";\n    instanceCoordination->BroadcastInstanceInformation(dungeonGroup,\
      \ oss.str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the Group class's internal messaging system to deliver
    updates. It is designed for use within instance-based content such as raids or
    dungeons where synchronized information sharing is critical. The implementation
    may involve network serialization and packet sending operations that could impact
    performance if called excessively in rapid succession.
  warnings: Ensure that the group pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Additionally,
    avoid broadcasting large messages that might exceed network packet limits or cause
    client-side performance issues.
