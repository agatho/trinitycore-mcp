  class: MageAI
  method: MageAI
  signature: void MageAI::MageAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the MageAI class with a player bot reference for AI behavior
    control.
  description: The MageAI constructor initializes the AI system for a player-controlled
    bot, setting up internal state and references needed for mage-specific AI behaviors.
    This method is typically called when a bot is created or assigned to a mage class
    character. It establishes the connection between the AI logic and the player object,
    allowing the AI to access player properties such as spell knowledge, mana levels,
    and current target information. The initialization process may also set up default
    behavior patterns, spell priorities, and combat strategies specific to the mage
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the mage bot that this
      AI will control. Must not be null for proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MageAI Initialization
    code: 'Player* myMageBot = new Player();

      MageAI mageAI(myMageBot);

      // AI is now initialized and ready to control the mage bot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. The bot parameter
    must point to a valid Player object with proper initialization, otherwise undefined
    behavior may occur. The AI system relies on the player's spellbook and mana resources
    being properly set up before this constructor is invoked.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the bot parameter will likely cause crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized before
    passing it to this constructor.
