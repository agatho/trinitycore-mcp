  signature: uint32 VengeanceDemonHunterRefactored::GetSpellResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the resource cost of a specified spell for the Vengeance Demon
    Hunter class.
  description: This method calculates and returns the resource cost associated with
    executing a given spell ID for the Vengeance Demon Hunter specialization. The
    resource cost typically corresponds to Fury, which is the primary resource used
    by this class. This function is essential for determining whether a player has
    sufficient resources to cast a spell, particularly in scenarios involving spell
    validation, cooldown management, or UI element updates. It does not modify any
    internal state and serves purely as a lookup mechanism based on spell definitions
    within the game's database.
  parameters: []
  returns: The resource cost (in Fury points) required to cast the specified spell.
    Returns zero if the spell ID is invalid or if no resource cost is defined for
    that spell in the game's configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check Resource Cost Before Casting
    code: "uint32 furyCost = vengeanceDH->GetSpellResourceCost(204021); // Example:\
      \ Eye Beam\nif (furyCost > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with spell casting logic\n\
      \    if (player->GetPower(POWER_FURY) >= furyCost)\n        player->ModifyPower(POWER_FURY,\
      \ -static_cast<int32>(furyCost));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell data tables and assumes that the spell
    ID passed is valid for the Vengeance Demon Hunter class. It may return zero if
    the spell does not consume Fury or if it's not implemented in the current version
    of TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid spell known by
    the Vengeance Demon Hunter class; otherwise, unexpected behavior or incorrect
    resource costs may occur.
