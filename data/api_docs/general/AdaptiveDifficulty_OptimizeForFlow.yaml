  method: OptimizeForFlow
  signature: void AdaptiveDifficulty::OptimizeForFlow(BotAI * bot, Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts bot difficulty settings based on player flow and combat behavior
  description: The OptimizeForFlow method dynamically modifies adaptive difficulty
    parameters for a bot AI based on observed player behavior patterns and engagement
    flow. It analyzes the player's combat actions, movement patterns, and interaction
    frequency to adjust the bot's challenge level in real-time. This method ensures
    that the AI maintains an appropriate level of difficulty without becoming too
    predictable or too overwhelming for the player. The optimization considers factors
    such as player reaction time, aggression levels, and engagement duration to fine-tune
    the bot's response strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that will have its difficulty settings
      adjusted
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player instance whose behavior patterns are analyzed
      for difficulty optimization
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI()\n{\n    if (Player* player = GetPlayer())\n    {\n\
      \        AdaptiveDifficulty::OptimizeForFlow(this, player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat flow analysis
    code: "void CombatManager::ProcessCombatFlow()\n{\n    if (BotAI* bot = GetActiveBot())\n\
      \    {\n        if (Player* player = GetPlayerTarget())\n        {\n       \
      \     AdaptiveDifficulty::OptimizeForFlow(bot, player);\n            // Continue\
      \ with combat logic\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    optimal difficulty balance. The implementation analyzes behavioral patterns over
    time rather than individual actions, so multiple calls are needed for effective
    optimization. Performance impact is minimal as it only processes behavioral data
    when significant changes are detected.
  warnings: Do not call this method with null pointers as it will cause undefined
    behavior. Ensure both bot and player parameters are valid before invocation. The
    method modifies internal AI state, so calling it during critical combat sequences
    may affect gameplay flow.
