documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic selling of junk items to NPCs.
  description: The SetAutoSellJunk method configures whether the player's character
    will automatically sell identified junk items to nearby NPCs during interactions.
    This functionality is typically used in conjunction with NPC interaction systems
    to streamline item management and optimize inventory space. When enabled, the
    system will scan the player's inventory for items that are classified as junk
    and attempt to sell them to eligible NPCs within range. The method does not perform
    any immediate selling action; instead, it sets a flag that affects future interactions
    with NPCs. This feature is commonly used in automated gameplay scripts or player-controlled
    bots to reduce manual item management.

  notes: This method only affects the behavior of future NPC interactions. It does
    not retroactively sell items already in the inventory. The actual selling process
    occurs during NPC interaction events, not immediately upon calling this method.
