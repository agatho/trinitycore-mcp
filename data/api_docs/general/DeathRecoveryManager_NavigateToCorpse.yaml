  brief: Initiates navigation to the player's corpse after death
  description: The NavigateToCorpse method is responsible for handling the automatic
    movement of a player character back to their death location. This method is typically
    invoked during the death recovery process in TrinityCore, allowing players to
    return to their corpse to retrieve items or perform other post-death actions.
    The method manages pathfinding and movement logic to ensure the player reaches
    their corpse location efficiently. It may also handle special cases such as corpse
    decay timers or restricted zones where navigation is not permitted.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if navigation to the corpse was successfully initiated or
    completed, false if navigation failed due to invalid state, pathfinding issues,
    or other constraints preventing movement to the corpse location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death recovery context
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.NavigateToCorpse()) {\n    // Player successfully\
      \ navigated to corpse\n    sLog->outString(\"Player returned to corpse successfully\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Navigation failed, handle accordingly\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to navigate to corpse\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's movement handler and pathfinding
    system. It may be called automatically during the death recovery sequence or manually
    by game systems requiring corpse retrieval. The implementation might consider
    factors such as corpse location validity, player state (dead vs alive), and server-side
    restrictions.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player is in a valid death state
    with a known corpse location. Calling it outside of appropriate contexts may result
    in undefined behavior or movement glitches. The method may not work correctly
    if the corpse has decayed or been removed from the game world.
