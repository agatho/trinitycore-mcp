  method: _IsEffectPrevented
  signature: bool SpellScript::_IsEffectPrevented(int effIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a spell effect has been prevented from executing.
  description: The _IsEffectPrevented method determines if a specific spell effect,
    identified by its index, has been blocked or disabled during spell execution.
    This is commonly used in SpellScript implementations to conditionally alter behavior
    based on whether an effect was prevented by external factors such as immunity,
    dispel, or other game mechanics. The method operates within the context of a spell's
    lifecycle and provides access to the current state of individual effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell effect has been prevented from executing,
    false otherwise. A prevented effect typically means that the intended outcome
    of that effect will not occur, though the spell itself may still proceed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in SpellScript
    code: "class MySpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleEffectExecute()\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (_IsEffectPrevented(EFFECT_0))\n        {\n  \
      \          // Handle case where first effect was prevented\n            SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Effect was prevented!\");\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during the execution phase of a spell script,
    typically within effect handlers or after spell effects have been processed. The
    effect index corresponds to the order in which effects are defined in the spell
    template and must be valid for the current spell.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a spell's execution context may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that the effect index passed is
    valid and corresponds to an actual effect in the spell being processed.
