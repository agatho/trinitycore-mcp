documentation:
  brief: Converts a world coordinate position to navigation mesh coordinates.
  description: The WorldToNav method transforms a world position represented as an
    integer into corresponding navigation mesh coordinates stored as floating-point
    values. This conversion is essential for pathfinding and movement calculations
    within the game environment, allowing the AI and movement systems to work with
    the navmesh data structure that represents walkable areas. The method takes a
    reference to an integer representing the world position and outputs the converted
    coordinates into a float array. It's commonly used in conjunction with other navigation
    mesh functions to determine valid movement paths for NPCs and players.
  parameters:
  - name: worldPos
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the world coordinate position.
      This typically represents a packed or encoded world position that needs to be
      converted to navmesh coordinates.
  - name: navPos
    description: Pointer to a float array of size 3 (x, y, z) where the converted
      navigation mesh coordinates will be stored. The output values represent the
      equivalent position in the navmesh coordinate system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic World to Nav Conversion
    code: 'int worldPosition = 12345;

      float navCoordinates[3];

      navMeshInterface->WorldToNav(worldPosition, navCoordinates);

      // navCoordinates now contains the converted navmesh coordinates'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Converted Coordinates for Pathfinding
    code: 'int playerWorldPos = GetPlayerWorldPosition();

      float navStart[3];

      navMeshInterface->WorldToNav(playerWorldPos, navStart);


      // Use navStart coordinates for pathfinding operations

      float targetNavPos[3] = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      // Perform pathfinding using navStart and targetNavPos'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the world position is properly encoded or packed
    according to the game's coordinate system. The conversion process may involve
    scaling factors or transformations specific to the map or zone where the position
    exists. Developers should ensure that the navPos array has sufficient space (at
    least 3 floats) before calling this method.
  warnings: The input worldPos parameter is passed by reference, so make sure it's
    a valid integer value. Passing an invalid or uninitialized reference could lead
    to undefined behavior. Also, ensure that the navPos pointer is not null and points
    to a valid memory location with sufficient capacity for three float values.
