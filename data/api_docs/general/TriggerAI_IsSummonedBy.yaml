  method: IsSummonedBy
  signature: void TriggerAI::IsSummonedBy(int * summoner)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the summoner reference for the trigger AI.
  description: The IsSummonedBy method is used to assign or update the reference to
    the creature or unit that summoned this trigger. This method is typically invoked
    during the initialization or activation of a triggered effect, allowing the AI
    system to maintain awareness of the summoning entity. It plays a crucial role
    in maintaining proper AI behavior and interaction logic for summoned triggers
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the summoning creature or unit. This value is used to track the relationship
      between the trigger and its summoner.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Trigger Initialization
    code: "void TriggerAI::InitializeTrigger(Creature* summoner)\n{\n    uint64 summonerGUID\
      \ = summoner->GetGUID();\n    IsSummonedBy(&summonerGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Summoner Reference in AI Logic
    code: "void TriggerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_summoner && m_summoner->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        // Perform actions based on summoner's state\n        DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle case where summoner is dead or gone\n\
      \        me->DespawnOrUnsummon();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during the trigger's initialization phase to
    establish a valid reference to its summoner. The summoner parameter must point
    to a valid GUID value; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting or using the summoner reference can lead to memory
    access violations or unexpected AI behavior. Always ensure that the summoner exists
    and is valid before calling this method.
