documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild invite packet sent by a player to invite another player
    by name.
  description: The HandleGuildInviteByName method is responsible for processing incoming
    guild invitation requests from players. When a player sends a guild invite packet
    containing the name of another player, this method retrieves the target player's
    session, verifies that the inviter has proper guild permissions, and checks if
    the invited player is eligible to join a guild. It then sends an appropriate response
    back to the inviting player indicating success or failure of the invitation. This
    method is part of the WorldSession class and handles communication with the client
    for guild-related operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Guild Invite Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildInviteByName(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildInviteByName&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation would validate the invite request\n\
      \    // and send appropriate responses to both players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the main packet handling loop when
    a client sends a guild invite by name. The actual invitation logic involves checking
    guild permissions, player status (online/offline), and guild limits. This method
    does not directly send packets to the target player; it relies on other systems
    to handle that part of the process.
  warnings: Improper validation in this method could lead to unauthorized guild invitations
    or exploits. Developers should ensure proper checks are made for player online
    status, guild membership limits, and permission levels before processing any invite
    requests.
