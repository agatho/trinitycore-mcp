  class: GuildBankManager
  method: RemoveExpiredItems
  signature: void GuildBankManager::RemoveExpiredItems(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Removes expired items from the guild bank inventory.
  description: The RemoveExpiredItems method iterates through all items stored in
    the guild bank and removes any items that have exceeded their designated time
    limit or expiration date. This functionality ensures that temporary or limited-time
    items do not remain in the guild bank indefinitely. The method typically runs
    periodically as part of the game's maintenance routines to keep the guild bank
    inventory clean and up-to-date. It may also be triggered manually under specific
    conditions such as when a guild member logs in or when certain guild events occur.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's GUID or identifier.
      This parameter is likely used to determine which player's actions trigger the
      removal of expired items, though its exact usage within the method implementation
      is not specified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildBankManager bankManager;

      int playerId = 12345;

      bankManager.RemoveExpiredItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database operations to update item expiration
    status and may involve locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent access issues
    during inventory updates. It is recommended to call this method during low-traffic
    periods to minimize performance impact.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player ID pointer could result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player parameter points to a valid,
    initialized integer before invoking the method.
