  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: SetThreshold
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::SetThreshold(MetricType type, AlertLevel
    level, uint64_t threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a performance threshold for a specified metric and alert level within
    the bot performance monitoring system.
  description: The SetThreshold method configures a numerical threshold value for
    a given performance metric and alert level. This allows administrators or developers
    to define acceptable performance boundaries for various bot-related metrics such
    as CPU usage, memory consumption, or response times. When a monitored metric exceeds
    its defined threshold, the system can trigger alerts or take corrective actions.
    The method operates on a per-metric, per-alert-level basis, enabling fine-grained
    control over performance monitoring parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The type of performance metric to configure (e.g., CPU_USAGE, MEMORY_USAGE,
      RESPONSE_TIME). Must be a valid MetricType enum value.
  - name: level
    description: The alert level that the threshold applies to (e.g., WARNING, CRITICAL).
      Must be a valid AlertLevel enum value.
  - name: threshold
    description: The numerical threshold value above which an alert will be triggered.
      This is typically a uint64_t representing the maximum acceptable value for the
      metric.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting CPU Usage Warning Threshold
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor::instance().SetThreshold(MetricType::CPU_USAGE, AlertLevel::WARNING,
      80);

      // Sets the CPU usage warning threshold to 80%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Memory Usage Critical Threshold
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor::instance().SetThreshold(MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE,
      AlertLevel::CRITICAL, 1024 * 1024 * 50);

      // Sets the memory usage critical threshold to 50MB'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during system initialization or configuration
    updates. Changes take effect immediately and may trigger immediate alerts if current
    values exceed new thresholds. The method does not validate that the threshold
    value is reasonable for the specific metric type, so care should be taken when
    setting values.
  warnings: Setting thresholds too low may result in frequent false positives, while
    setting them too high may cause important issues to go unnoticed. Ensure that
    threshold values are appropriate for the expected performance characteristics
    of the monitored system.
