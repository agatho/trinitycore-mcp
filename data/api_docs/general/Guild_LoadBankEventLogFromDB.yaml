  signature: bool Guild::LoadBankEventLogFromDB(int * fields)
documentation:
  brief: Loads the guild bank event log from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadBankEventLogFromDB method retrieves all recorded bank transaction
    events for a guild from the database and populates the internal event log structure.
    This method is typically invoked during guild initialization or when the guild's
    bank log needs to be refreshed. It ensures that the guild's historical bank activity,
    such as item deposits, withdrawals, and modifications, is available for display
    in the client interface and for administrative purposes. The method operates on
    a per-guild basis and requires proper database connectivity and access permissions.
    It does not validate the data beyond basic loading; any inconsistencies should
    be handled by calling methods or external validation routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the event log was successfully loaded from the database,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate a database error, missing
    data, or an empty log.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Initialization
    code: "Guild* guild = new Guild();\nif (guild->LoadBankEventLogFromDB(nullptr))\
      \ {\n    // Bank event log successfully loaded\n    sLog->outString(\"Guild\
      \ bank event log loaded successfully.\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure case\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to load guild bank event log.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the Guild class during construction
    or when explicitly requested. It assumes that the database connection is already
    established and that the calling context has appropriate permissions to read from
    the relevant tables. The event log data is stored in an internal container which
    can be accessed via other methods like GetBankEventLog().
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you are certain about its side
    effects or are implementing a custom guild loading routine. Improper use may lead
    to inconsistent state if the event log is not properly synchronized with other
    guild data.
