  class: SpawnData
  method: SpawnData
  signature: void SpawnData::SpawnData(SpawnObjectType t)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpawnData object with the specified spawn object type.
  description: The SpawnData constructor initializes a new instance of the SpawnData
    class, setting up internal state based on the provided spawn object type. This
    method is typically used during the creation or initialization phase of game entities
    such as creatures, game objects, or dynamic objects within the TrinityCore framework.
    The constructor ensures that all necessary data structures are properly allocated
    and configured for the specific type of spawn object being created. It performs
    essential setup operations required for the object to be correctly managed by
    the server's spawn system.
  parameters:
  - name: t
    description: The spawn object type enumeration value that determines how the SpawnData
      instance will be initialized and managed. Valid values typically include types
      like CREATURE, GAMEOBJECT, DYNAMICOBJECT, etc., as defined in the SpawnObjectType
      enum.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Creature Spawn Data
    code: 'SpawnData creatureSpawn(SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE);

      // Initializes a SpawnData object for a creature spawn type'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Different Spawn Types
    code: 'SpawnData goSpawn(SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT);

      SpawnData dynSpawn(SPAWN_TYPE_DYNAMICOBJECT);

      // Creates separate SpawnData instances for different object types'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore spawn
    management system. Developers should not directly instantiate SpawnData objects
    unless implementing custom spawn logic or extensions to the core system. The constructor
    may perform memory allocation and initialization that's critical for proper object
    lifecycle management.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of SpawnData objects outside of the intended context
    may lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption. The SpawnData class is designed
    to be used through the server's spawn management interfaces, not as a standalone
    construct. Ensure proper usage within the framework's design patterns.
