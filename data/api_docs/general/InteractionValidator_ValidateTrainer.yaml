  class: InteractionValidator
  method: ValidateTrainer
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::ValidateTrainer(::Player * bot, ::Creature
    * trainer) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates if a player can interact with a trainer creature.
  description: The ValidateTrainer method checks whether a given player character
    is eligible to interact with a specified trainer creature. It evaluates various
    conditions such as the player's level, faction, quest requirements, and trainer
    availability. This validation ensures that only appropriate players can access
    training services, maintaining game balance and proper progression mechanics.
    The method returns true if all validation criteria are met, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to interact with the trainer.
  - name: trainer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the trainer NPC that
      the player is trying to interact with.
  returns: Returns true if the player can interact with the trainer, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether all validation checks have passed successfully.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Check
    code: "if (validator.ValidateTrainer(player, trainer)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ trainer interaction\n    player->GetSession()->SendTrainerList(trainer);\n\
      } else {\n    // Prevent interaction\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You cannot\
      \ interact with this trainer.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in AI Behavior
    code: "bool BotAI::CanTrainWith(::Creature* trainer) {\n    if (!trainer || !GetPlayer())\
      \ return false;\n    return m_InteractionValidator->ValidateTrainer(GetPlayer(),\
      \ trainer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks such as player level requirements, faction
    restrictions, and quest completion status. It may also verify that the trainer
    is currently available for training (not in combat or otherwise disabled). The
    implementation probably leverages existing TrinityCore APIs for checking player
    state and creature flags.
  warnings: Ensure both parameters are valid pointers before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer dereferences. The validation logic might be affected by custom
    server configurations or expansion-specific rules that could alter trainer availability
    conditions.
