  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GetPerformanceImprovements
  signature: std::vector<PerformanceComparison> BotPerformanceAnalytics::GetPerformanceImprovements(uint32_t
    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a vector of performance comparison data representing improvements
    in bot behavior.
  description: The GetPerformanceImprovements method returns a collection of PerformanceComparison
    objects that detail enhancements or changes in bot performance metrics. This method
    is typically used to analyze and track the effectiveness of optimizations or modifications
    made to bot AI logic within the TrinityCore framework. The returned data can be
    utilized for debugging, performance tuning, or generating reports on bot behavior
    improvements over time. The method does not require any parameters and provides
    a snapshot of recent performance enhancements.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<PerformanceComparison> containing structured data about performance
    improvements. Each PerformanceComparison object likely includes metrics such as
    execution time, resource usage, or behavioral efficiency gains. Returns an empty
    vector if no performance improvements are recorded or tracked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Performance Improvements
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<PerformanceComparison>\
      \ improvements = analytics.GetPerformanceImprovements(10);\nfor (const auto&\
      \ comp : improvements) {\n    std::cout << \"Improvement ID: \" << comp.id <<\
      \ \", Score: \" << comp.score << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger analytics framework designed to monitor
    bot behavior in World of Warcraft environments. It assumes that performance tracking
    has been enabled and that relevant data has been collected. The method may be
    computationally intensive if large amounts of historical data are stored, so consider
    caching results when used frequently.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotPerformanceAnalytics instance is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as accessing uninitialized or corrupted data structures
    could lead to undefined behavior. This method should not be called from high-frequency
    update loops due to potential performance implications.
