  class: MeleePositionStrategy
  method: GetFlankPosition
  signature: int MeleePositionStrategy::GetFlankPosition(Unit * target, bool leftSide)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal flank position relative to a target unit
    for melee combat.
  description: The GetFlankPosition method determines the best positional offset for
    a unit to flank a target during melee engagement. It evaluates the target's orientation
    and positioning to calculate an advantageous location that maximizes attack effectiveness
    while minimizing exposure. The method considers whether the left or right side
    of the target should be flanked based on the provided boolean parameter. This
    functionality is typically used by AI-controlled units to improve their tactical
    positioning in combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit to flank.
      Must not be null.
  - name: leftSide
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to calculate a position on the left
      side (true) or right side (false) of the target.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated flank position offset.
    Positive values indicate positioning to the right of the target, negative values
    indicate positioning to the left, and zero indicates no positional adjustment
    is needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flank Position Calculation
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      int flankPos = strategy->GetFlankPosition(target, true);

      // flankPos now contains the offset for left-side flanking'
    language: cpp
  - title: Tactical Flanking with Conditional Logic
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nint leftFlank = strategy->GetFlankPosition(target,\
      \ true);\nint rightFlank = strategy->GetFlankPosition(target, false);\nif (leftFlank\
      \ > rightFlank) {\n    // Prefer left-side flanking\n    position = leftFlank;\n\
      } else {\n    // Prefer right-side flanking\n    position = rightFlank;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target unit is valid and in a combat state.
    The returned value should be used in conjunction with movement or positioning
    calculations to achieve actual flank positioning. Performance is generally optimal
    as it only performs geometric calculations based on unit orientation.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. The method does
    not validate whether the calculated position is actually reachable or within combat
    range.
