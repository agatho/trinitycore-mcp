  signature: void PlayerMenu::SendQuestQueryResponse(const Quest * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest query response packet to the player containing detailed quest
    information.
  description: The SendQuestQueryResponse method constructs and sends a quest details
    packet to the connected player client. This method is typically invoked when a
    player interacts with a quest giver NPC or clicks on a quest in their quest log.
    The packet includes comprehensive information about the quest such as title, description,
    objectives, rewards, and quest flags. It serves as the primary mechanism for transmitting
    quest data from the server to the client, ensuring that players receive accurate
    and up-to-date quest information during gameplay interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: A pointer to the Quest object containing the quest data to be sent
      to the player. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Giver Interaction
    code: "void PlayerMenu::HandleQuestGiverHello(Player* player, uint64 questGiverGUID)\n\
      {\n    // ... code to find quest giver ...\n    Quest const* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      \    if (quest)\n    {\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestQueryResponse(quest);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Multiple Quest Responses
    code: "void PlayerMenu::SendAvailableQuests(Player* player)\n{\n    // ... code\
      \ to iterate through available quests ...\n    for (auto const& quest : availableQuests)\n\
      \    {\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestQueryResponse(quest);\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles packet construction and sending, so developers
    should not manually create or send the underlying network packets. The method
    is part of the PlayerMenu class which manages player interaction with quest givers
    and quest-related UI elements.
  warnings: Ensure that the quest parameter is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. This method should only be called during active player sessions when
    the client is properly connected.
