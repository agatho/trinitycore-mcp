documentation:
  brief: Handles the pet's return movement behavior when it is commanded to return
    to its owner.
  description: The HandleReturnMovement method in PetAI manages the logic for a pet
    to move back to its owner's position. This method is typically invoked when a
    pet is instructed to return to its master, either through commands or when the
    pet becomes disoriented. It calculates the appropriate path and movement behavior
    to ensure the pet returns smoothly to the owner's location. The method may also
    handle cases where the pet is too far away or obstructed from reaching the owner
    directly. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper pet behavior
    in World of Warcraft's combat and non-combat scenarios.

  - title: Basic usage in pet AI context
    code: "void MyPetAI::OnCommandReturn()\n{\n    HandleReturnMovement();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PetAI system and relies on the pet's current position,
    owner's position, and movement restrictions. It may trigger pathfinding logic
    internally to determine the best route back to the owner.
