documentation:
  brief: Destroys the FlightMasterManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the FlightMasterManager class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any internal data structures, flight path references, and
    ensuring that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this manager handles flight master functionality
    such as available flight paths, taxi nodes, and related player movement logic.
    The destructor ensures proper cleanup when the object is removed from memory,
    typically during server shutdown or when a world session ends.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of FlightMasterManager instance
    code: "void Cleanup()\n{\n    // FlightMasterManager instance goes out of scope\n\
      \    // Destructor automatically called\n    FlightMasterManager manager;\n\
      \    // manager's destructor invoked here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called when a FlightMasterManager object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It should not be called directly unless
    the object was dynamically allocated with new. The implementation must ensure
    thread safety if multiple threads access flight path data concurrently.
