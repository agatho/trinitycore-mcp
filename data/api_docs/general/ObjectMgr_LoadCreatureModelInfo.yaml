documentation:
  brief: Loads creature model information from the database into memory for use in
    the game world.
  description: The LoadCreatureModelInfo method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with creature model data retrieved from the database. This includes
    loading model statistics, bounding boxes, and other physical properties associated
    with different creature models. The method is typically invoked during server
    startup or database reload operations to ensure that all creature models are properly
    registered and available for spawning in the game world. It processes entries
    from the creature_model_info table and stores them in a lookup structure for fast
    access during creature creation and gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n\
      \    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureModelInfo();\n    // Continue with other\
      \ initialization...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called once during server startup and should not be
    invoked repeatedly. The loaded data is cached in memory for performance reasons,
    so subsequent calls will not re-query the database unless the cache is explicitly
    cleared. The method assumes that the database connection is already established
    and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cache invalidation may
    lead to duplicate entries or memory leaks. It should only be called during controlled
    initialization phases when the server state is consistent and no creatures are
    actively being spawned or managed.
