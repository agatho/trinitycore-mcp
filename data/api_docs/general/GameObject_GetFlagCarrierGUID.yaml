  signature: const int & GameObject::GetFlagCarrierGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the player who currently carries the flag
    in a capture flag game mode.
  description: This method retrieves the GUID of the player who is currently carrying
    the flag object in a capture flag game mode. It is typically used in battleground
    scenarios where players are required to carry flags to score points. The method
    returns a constant reference to an integer representing the GUID, ensuring that
    the value cannot be modified directly. This functionality is essential for tracking
    flag ownership and determining game state during capture flag events.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a constant reference to an integer representing the GUID of the
    player who currently carries the flag. The value will be zero if no player is
    carrying the flag, or may represent a valid GUID if a player is currently carrying
    it.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "GameObject* flag = nullptr;\n\n// Assuming flag is a GameObject representing\
      \ a capture flag\nconst int& carrierGUID = flag->GetFlagCarrierGUID();\n\nif\
      \ (carrierGUID != 0)\n{\n    // A player is carrying the flag\n    // Do something\
      \ with the GUID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No player is carrying the flag\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battlegrounds where capture flag game modes
    are active. The returned GUID represents a valid player identifier, but may be
    zero if no player is currently carrying the flag. Performance considerations should
    be noted when using this method in frequent checks during gameplay.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method in scenarios involving multiple
    players or complex game state tracking, as incorrect handling of the returned
    GUID can lead to invalid game state or incorrect flag ownership tracking.
