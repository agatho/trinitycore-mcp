  signature: float LootStrategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of a loot strategy for use in
    bot AI decision making.
  description: The GetRelevance method computes a float value representing how relevant
    or useful a particular loot strategy is for a given bot AI context. This score
    is typically used by the AI system to prioritize which loot items or strategies
    should be considered first during loot evaluation. The relevance score can be
    influenced by factors such as item type, quality, player class, current inventory
    state, and other contextual variables. This method does not modify any internal
    state and is designed to be called frequently during AI decision-making loops.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the relevance score of the loot strategy. Higher
    values indicate higher relevance or priority. The exact range and interpretation
    depend on the implementation details of the specific loot strategy, but typically
    ranges from 0.0 (least relevant) to 1.0 (most relevant).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Context
    code: "float relevance = strategy->GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.7f)\n\
      {\n    // Prioritize this loot strategy\n    ai->SelectLootStrategy(strategy);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be lightweight and fast, as it may be called multiple
    times per AI decision cycle. The relevance calculation should ideally take into
    account current bot state such as inventory capacity, player class specialization,
    and available loot types.
