  class: BotLifecycle
  method: SetActivity
  signature: void BotLifecycle::SetActivity(const BotActivity & activity)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the current activity for a bot, defining its behavior and actions within
    the game world.
  description: The SetActivity method assigns a specific BotActivity to a bot instance,
    determining what role or behavior the bot will exhibit. This method is typically
    used in conjunction with the BotManager system to control how bots interact with
    the game world, including activities such as patrolling, combat, questing, or
    idle states. The activity state influences the bot's AI decision-making process
    and can affect its movement, target selection, and interaction patterns. When
    called, this method updates the internal state of the bot without requiring a
    restart or reload of the bot instance.
  parameters:
  - name: activity
    description: The BotActivity enum value that defines the bot's current behavior
      mode. Valid values include idle, patrol, combat, questing, and others as defined
      in the BotActivity enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Bot to Patrol Activity
    code: 'BotLifecycle* bot = sBotManager->GetBot(botGuid);

      bot->SetActivity(BotActivity::PATROL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning Combat Activity to a Bot
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    BotLifecycle* bot = sBotManager->GetBot(botGuid);\n\
      \    bot->SetActivity(BotActivity::COMBAT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the bot's internal state and should be called
    from a thread-safe context. The activity change takes effect immediately, potentially
    interrupting any ongoing actions the bot was performing before the change.
  warnings: Calling SetActivity with an invalid BotActivity value may result in undefined
    behavior or default activity states. Ensure that the BotActivity enum values are
    properly validated before assignment to avoid unexpected AI behavior.
