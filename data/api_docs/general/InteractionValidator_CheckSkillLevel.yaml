  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CheckSkillLevel
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckSkillLevel(::Player * bot, uint32 skillId,
    uint32 minValue) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player's skill level meets or exceeds a specified minimum value.
  description: The CheckSkillLevel method evaluates whether the specified skill of
    a given player meets or exceeds the required minimum value. This function is typically
    used in interaction validation logic, such as determining if a player can perform
    certain actions based on their skill proficiency. It retrieves the player's current
    skill level for the given skill ID and compares it against the minimum threshold.
    The method returns true if the player's skill level is sufficient, or false otherwise.
    This check is commonly used in quest systems, crafting mechanics, and other gameplay
    elements where skill requirements are enforced.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose skill level is being checked.
      Must not be null.
  - name: skillId
    description: The unique identifier of the skill to check. This corresponds to
      the skill type in the game's database.
  - name: minValue
    description: The minimum required skill level that the player must meet or exceed
      for the check to pass.
  returns: Returns true if the player's skill level is greater than or equal to the
    minimum value, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Skill Level Check
    code: "if (validator.CheckSkillLevel(player, SKILL_ENGINERING, 100)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can craft advanced engineering items\n    player->AddItem(ItemTemplate,\
      \ 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Quest Validation
    code: "if (validator.CheckSkillLevel(player, SKILL_HERBALISM, 150)) {\n    //\
      \ Player qualifies to receive a high-level herbalism quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(QUEST_HERBALISM_MASTER);\n\
      } else {\n    player->SendNotification(\"You need at least 150 Herbalism skill\
      \ to complete this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current skill data stored in the database.
    It does not account for temporary buffs or temporary skill modifications. The
    skill ID must correspond to a valid skill defined in the game's skill system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    skill levels are typically capped at maximum values defined by the game rules.
