documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat state of the bot's threat manager to reflect current engagement
    status with targets.
  description: The UpdateCombatState method is responsible for synchronizing the internal
    combat state of a bot's threat management system with the actual combat conditions
    in the game world. This includes evaluating whether the bot is currently in combat,
    updating threat levels against active targets, and managing the transition between
    combat and non-combat states. The method typically gets invoked during the bot's
    update cycle to ensure that its threat calculations remain accurate as the battlefield
    dynamics change. It may also trigger related actions such as adjusting target
    selection, modifying behavior patterns, or updating the bot's AI decision-making
    process based on current threat levels.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Update Loop
    code: "void Bot::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    m_threatManager->UpdateCombatState();\n\
      \    // ... continue with AI decisions ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the bot's regular update cycle
    and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior.
    The implementation may involve checking unit status flags, target validity, and
    combat engagement states to determine the appropriate threat management actions.
