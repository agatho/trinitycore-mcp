  signature: void GroupCoordination::ExecuteCommand(CoordinationCommand command, const
    int & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a coordination command for group members with specified target IDs
  description: The ExecuteCommand method processes a given CoordinationCommand for
    a set of group members identified by their target IDs. This method is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to synchronize group actions,
    such as coordinating loot distribution, movement, or combat strategies. The command
    is executed across all specified targets within the group coordination system,
    ensuring that all relevant players receive and process the command appropriately.
    This functionality supports dynamic group management and real-time coordination
    during dungeon runs, raids, and other group activities.
  parameters:
  - name: command
    description: The CoordinationCommand enum value specifying the type of coordination
      action to execute. Valid commands include loot sharing, movement synchronization,
      combat stance changes, and other group-based operations.
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target IDs of group members
      affected by this command. These IDs typically correspond to player GUIDs or
      internal group member identifiers used within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Execute Loot Coordination Command
    code: "GroupCoordination coordination;\nCoordinationCommand lootCommand = COORDINATION_LOOT_MASTER;\n\
      int targetIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    coordination.ExecuteCommand(lootCommand,\
      \ targetIds[i]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Coordinate Group Movement
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      CoordinationCommand moveCommand = COORDINATION_MOVE_SYNC;

      const int targetId = 12345;

      coordination.ExecuteCommand(moveCommand, targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore group coordination system and
    assumes that the targets are valid group members. The implementation may involve
    network synchronization and should be called from a context where group membership
    is properly established. Performance considerations include minimizing frequent
    command execution to avoid excessive network traffic.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid target IDs or non-existent group members
    may result in undefined behavior or errors within the coordination system. Ensure
    that targets are validated before calling ExecuteCommand to prevent runtime exceptions.
