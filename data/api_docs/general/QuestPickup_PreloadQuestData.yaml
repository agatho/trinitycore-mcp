  class: QuestPickup
  method: PreloadQuestData
  signature: void QuestPickup::PreloadQuestData(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Preloads quest data for a bot player to optimize quest-related operations.
  description: The QuestPickup::PreloadQuestData method initializes and loads all
    relevant quest information for a specified bot player. This includes fetching
    quest states, available quests, and related data from the database or cache to
    ensure efficient processing during quest pickup events. The method is typically
    called before initiating quest-related actions to minimize latency and improve
    performance. It prepares internal data structures required for tracking quest
    progress and availability without requiring additional database queries during
    runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which quest
      data is being preloaded. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PreloadQuestData
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player

      QuestPickup questPickup;

      questPickup.PreloadQuestData(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked before any quest pickup operations to ensure
    optimal performance. It may perform database queries or cache lookups depending
    on the current state of the bot's quest data.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and represents an actual
    bot character, not a regular player. Passing a null pointer will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes.
