documentation:
  brief: Sends a zone under attack message to a player when a creature is attacked.
  description: This method sends a zone under attack message to the specified player
    when a creature is attacked by a player or creature. It is used in World of Warcraft's
    PvP system to notify players about territorial control changes. The method typically
    triggers when a creature enters combat with a player, and it sends an update about
    the zone being under attack to the player's client. This functionality is essential
    for maintaining proper PvP mechanics and territorial awareness in the game.
  parameters:
  - name: attacker
    description: A pointer to the Player object that is attacking the creature. This
      parameter determines which player receives the zone under attack message.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      Player* attacker = new Player();

      creature->SendZoneUnderAttackMessage(attacker);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat situations when a creature
    is attacked by a player. It's important to note that this method only sends the
    message if the creature is in a zone where PvP rules apply, such as battlegrounds
    or zones with territorial control.
  warnings: The method should not be called directly without proper context, as it
    may cause client-side issues if used incorrectly. Ensure that the attacker player
    is valid and that the creature is actually under attack before calling this method.
