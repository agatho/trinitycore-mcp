  class: PlayerProfile
  method: AddSample
  signature: void PlayerProfile::AddSample(const BehaviorSample & sample)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a behavior sample to the player profile for analysis and tracking.
  description: The AddSample method is used to insert a BehaviorSample object into
    the PlayerProfile's collection of behavioral data. This method allows the game
    engine to record and analyze player actions, decisions, or interactions within
    the World of Warcraft environment. The added samples are typically used for AI
    behavior modeling, player profiling, or statistical analysis of gameplay patterns.
    The method does not return any value as it directly modifies the internal state
    of the PlayerProfile object.
  parameters:
  - name: sample
    description: A const reference to a BehaviorSample object containing behavioral
      data to be added to the profile. This sample should contain relevant information
      about player actions, choices, or environmental interactions that are meaningful
      for profiling purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PlayerProfile profile;

      BehaviorSample sample;

      sample.SetAction(BehaviorAction::LOOT_ITEM);

      sample.SetTimestamp(time(nullptr));

      profile.AddSample(sample);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal validation on the sample data before
    adding it to ensure data integrity. It may also trigger events or notifications
    to other systems that monitor player behavior changes.
