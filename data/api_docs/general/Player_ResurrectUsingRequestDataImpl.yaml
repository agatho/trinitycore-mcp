documentation:
  brief: Resurrects the player using request data from the resurrection spell.
  description: This method handles the process of resurrecting a player character
    using data provided by the resurrection spell. It typically involves processing
    the resurrection request, applying necessary game mechanics such as restoring
    health and mana, and potentially handling various state changes including removing
    death penalty effects. The method is part of the core resurrection functionality
    within TrinityCore's Player class and ensures proper execution of the resurrection
    process based on the request data provided.

  - title: Basic Resurrection Usage
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ResurrectUsingRequestDataImpl();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of resurrection request data, which
    may involve checking for valid resurrection sources and applying appropriate effects.
    Performance considerations include potential delay in execution if the player
    is in a state requiring specific processing before ressurection can occur.
  warnings: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state
    for resurrection, typically after death or during certain game states where resurrection
    is allowed. Calling this method outside of proper contexts may lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors.
