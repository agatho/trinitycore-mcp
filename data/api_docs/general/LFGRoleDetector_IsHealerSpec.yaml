  signature: bool LFGRoleDetector::IsHealerSpec(uint32 specId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified specialization ID corresponds to a healer
    role in World of Warcraft.
  description: The IsHealerSpec method evaluates a given specialization identifier
    to determine if it represents a healing class specialization within the TrinityCore
    framework. This functionality is crucial for LFG (Looking for Group) systems and
    role-based matchmaking, as it helps identify which player specializations are
    suitable for healer roles in dungeons, raids, and other group content. The method
    checks against predefined healer specializations for all classes that can perform
    healing duties in World of Warcraft, including disciplines like Holy Paladin,
    Discipline Priest, Restoration Shaman, and Moonkin Druid. It returns true if the
    specId matches a known healer specialization, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided specId corresponds to a healer specialization;
    otherwise returns false. The method does not throw exceptions or return error
    codes.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spec is a healer
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector roleDetector;

      uint32 holyPaladinSpec = 70;

      bool isHealer = roleDetector.IsHealerSpec(holyPaladinSpec);

      // isHealer will be true for Holy Paladin specialization

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on hardcoded specialization IDs that correspond to healer
    roles in the game. Developers should ensure that any changes to class specializations
    in the game client are reflected in this logic. The implementation assumes a fixed
    mapping of spec IDs to healer roles and does not dynamically query the game database
    for role information.
  warnings: This method only works with valid specialization IDs from the World of
    Warcraft client. Invalid or unknown spec IDs may return false, which could lead
    to incorrect role assignments in LFG systems if not properly validated.
