  signature: void InterruptManager::OptimizeRotationForEncounter(uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the interrupt rotation for a specific encounter based on encounter
    ID
  description: The OptimizeRotationForEncounter method adjusts the interrupt behavior
    and rotation timing for a player's abilities based on the provided encounter ID.
    This method is typically used in combat scenarios where specific encounters require
    different interrupt strategies or timing optimizations to maximize effectiveness.
    The method modifies internal state within the InterruptManager to reflect the
    optimal rotation for the given encounter, potentially adjusting cooldowns, priority
    orders, or ability usage patterns. It is designed to be called when entering a
    new encounter to ensure that the player's interrupt abilities are properly tuned
    for that specific combat situation.
  parameters:
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the encounter that determines the optimal interrupt
      rotation strategy. This ID typically corresponds to a specific boss fight or
      encounter type in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat entry
    code: "void PlayerAI::OnEnterCombat(uint32 encounterId)\n{\n    interruptManager.OptimizeRotationForEncounter(encounterId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with encounter-specific logic
    code: "void CombatHandler::HandleEncounterStart(uint32 encounterId)\n{\n    if\
      \ (encounterId == 12345) // Specific boss encounter\n    {\n        interruptManager.OptimizeRotationForEncounter(encounterId);\n\
      \        // Additional encounter-specific logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables within the InterruptManager
    class to store optimized rotation data. It may be called multiple times during
    a single encounter if the encounter has multiple phases or changes in behavior.
    The method assumes that valid encounter IDs are passed and may not handle invalid
    IDs gracefully.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper encounter ID validation may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect interrupt rotations. This method should only be
    called when entering an actual combat encounter, not during idle periods or non-combat
    situations.
