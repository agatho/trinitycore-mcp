  method: SetDataRetentionDays
  signature: void BotProfiler::SetDataRetentionDays(uint32_t days)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of days to retain bot profiling data.
  description: The SetDataRetentionDays method configures how long bot profiling information
    is stored in the system. This setting determines the maximum age of data before
    it is automatically purged from the database or memory storage. The retention
    period affects all bot profiling records and ensures that old performance data
    does not accumulate indefinitely, helping to maintain optimal database size and
    query performance. This method typically updates internal configuration parameters
    that control data lifecycle management for bot analytics.
  parameters:
  - name: days
    description: The number of days to retain bot profiling data. Must be a positive
      integer value. Setting this to 0 may disable data retention or use a default
      value depending on implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set 30-day data retention
    code: BotProfiler::SetDataRetentionDays(30);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable data retention (if supported)
    code: BotProfiler::SetDataRetentionDays(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal configuration settings that are applied
    at runtime. Changes may not take effect immediately and could require a server
    restart or explicit refresh of the profiler system to be fully effective. The
    actual data purging process is typically handled by a background task or scheduled
    job.
  warnings: Setting retention days to 0 might have unintended consequences depending
    on how the system handles zero values. Ensure that any configuration changes are
    tested in a development environment before applying to production servers.
