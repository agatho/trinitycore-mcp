  brief: Loads CUf profiles for the player
  description: This method is responsible for loading Custom Unit Frame (CUF) profiles
    for the player character. It typically handles the retrieval and application of
    saved frame configurations that define how unit frames appear in the game interface.
    The method likely involves parsing stored data from database or configuration
    files and applying these settings to the player's UI elements.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_LoadCUFProfiles(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the internal UI management system and may be called
    during player initialization or when switching between different character profiles.
    Implementation details involve handling database queries and applying frame settings
    to ensure proper display of unit frames.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code; it's typically
    invoked internally during player loading process. Incorrect usage could lead to
    UI misconfiguration or missing frame settings.
