  class: ConversationAI
  method: OnCreate
  signature: void ConversationAI::OnCreate(Unit * creator)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes conversation AI behavior when a conversation is created by a
    unit.
  description: The OnCreate method is invoked when a ConversationAI object is initialized,
    typically upon creation of a conversation involving a unit. This method sets up
    the initial state and behavior for the conversation AI, preparing it to handle
    dialogue events and responses. It may initialize internal data structures, register
    event handlers, or perform setup operations required for the conversation to function
    correctly within the game world. The method is called automatically by the TrinityCore
    framework during conversation creation and does not require explicit invocation
    by developers.
  parameters:
  - name: creator
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that initiated or created the conversation.
      This parameter represents the entity (player, NPC, etc.) responsible for starting
      the conversation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in conversation AI setup
    code: "class MyConversationAI : public ConversationAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCreate(Unit*\
      \ creator) override {\n        // Initialize conversation state\n        ConversationAI::OnCreate(creator);\n\
      \        // Additional custom initialization logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI lifecycle and should not be called directly
    by developers unless implementing a custom conversation AI class. The 'creator'
    parameter is guaranteed to be valid at the time of invocation, but its state may
    vary depending on when the conversation was initiated.
