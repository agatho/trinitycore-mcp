  method: SpellImplicitTargetInfo
  signature: void SpellImplicitTargetInfo::SpellImplicitTargetInfo(uint32 target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the implicit target information for a spell with the specified
    target type.
  description: The SpellImplicitTargetInfo constructor initializes internal data structures
    to define how spell targets are implicitly determined. This method sets up the
    target type information used by the spell system to resolve targets when no explicit
    target is provided. The target parameter defines the implicit targeting behavior,
    which can include self-targeting, enemy targeting, friendly targeting, or area-of-effect
    targeting. This initialization is crucial for proper spell execution and target
    validation within TrinityCore's spell handling framework.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The implicit target type identifier that defines how the spell should
      implicitly target entities. Valid values correspond to predefined target type
      constants in the TrinityCore spell system, such as TARGET_UNIT_CASTER, TARGET_UNIT_NEARBY_ENEMY,
      etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize spell with self-targeting
    code: 'SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo(TARGET_UNIT_CASTER);

      // This sets up the spell to target the caster themselves'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialize spell with nearby enemy targeting
    code: 'SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo(TARGET_UNIT_NEARBY_ENEMY);

      // This configures the spell to implicitly target the nearest enemy unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during spell template initialization
    and should not be invoked directly by regular gameplay code. The target type parameter
    must correspond to valid implicit target constants defined in the TrinityCore
    spell system to ensure proper functionality.
  warnings: Incorrect target type values may lead to undefined behavior or failed
    spell targeting. This method should only be used with predefined target constants
    from the spell system, not arbitrary integer values.
