  method: HandleQuestCompletion
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestCompletion(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Completes a quest for the specified player and processes associated quest
    rewards and objectives.
  description: The HandleQuestCompletion method is responsible for finalizing a quest
    that has been marked as complete by the player. It verifies the quest's completion
    status, grants applicable rewards such as experience points, gold, items, and
    reputation, and updates the player's quest log accordingly. This method ensures
    that all quest-related game mechanics are properly executed when a player finishes
    a quest. The method expects a valid player instance and a valid quest ID to proceed
    with the completion process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who has completed
      the quest. Must be a valid, non-null pointer.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that is being completed. Must
      correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Completion
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestCompletion(player, questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Completion with Error Handling
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 questId = 12345;\n\
      if (player && questId > 0)\n{\n    DynamicQuestSystem::HandleQuestCompletion(player,\
      \ questId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid input\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the core TrinityCore quest system and may
    trigger additional events or callbacks related to quest completion. It is assumed
    that the player's quest log and related data structures are updated internally
    by this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and not null, as passing
    an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Also, verify that the quest
    ID corresponds to a valid quest in the database to avoid unexpected errors during
    reward processing.
