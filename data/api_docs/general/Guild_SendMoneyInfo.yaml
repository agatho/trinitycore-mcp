  brief: Sends guild money information to the specified session.
  description: The SendMoneyInfo method transmits the current guild's financial status
    to a connected player's session. This includes details such as the guild's total
    money balance and any relevant monetary limits or restrictions. The method is
    typically invoked when a player opens the guild bank interface or requests financial
    information about their guild. It ensures that players have up-to-date information
    regarding their guild's funds, which is crucial for managing guild resources and
    making informed decisions about expenditures.

    code: "void HandleGuildMoneyInfo(WorldSession* session, const std::string& args)\n\
      {\n    if (Player* player = session->GetPlayer())\n    {\n        if (Guild*\
      \ guild = player->GetGuild())\n        {\n            guild->SendMoneyInfo(session);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the guild financial management system and should only
    be called when a player has appropriate permissions to view guild funds. The implementation
    likely involves sending a packet containing guild money data to the client, which
    then displays this information in the UI.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the session's player belongs
    to a guild may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure proper validation
    of the guild context before invoking this method.
