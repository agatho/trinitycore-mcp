documentation:
  brief: Called when a unit enters combat mode, triggering AI behavior initialization.
  description: The JustEnteredCombat method is invoked by the TrinityCore AI system
    when a Unit transitions into combat state. This method serves as a hook for custom
    AI implementations to perform initialization tasks or trigger specific behaviors
    upon entering combat. It is typically called internally by the core engine when
    a unit's combat state changes, and it allows developers to extend or override
    default combat behavior. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    no direct actions itself; instead, it is meant to be overridden in derived AI
    classes to implement custom logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Example
    code: "class MyAI : public UnitAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEnteredCombat(Unit*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Custom behavior when entering combat\n    \
      \    Talk(0);\n        // Call base implementation if needed\n        UnitAI::JustEnteredCombat(target);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI callback system and should be overridden in
    custom AI classes. It's called during the combat state transition, so any logic
    here will execute immediately upon entering combat. The Unit pointer passed to
    this method may be null if the unit entered combat without a specific target.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI system; it is intended
    for internal use and override purposes only. Be cautious about performing heavy
    operations in this method as it's called frequently during combat entry.
