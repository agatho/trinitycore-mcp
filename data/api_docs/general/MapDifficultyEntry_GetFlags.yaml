  class: MapDifficultyEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int MapDifficultyEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with a map difficulty entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags defined for a specific map difficulty in the TrinityCore database. These
    flags typically control various gameplay behaviors such as whether a difficulty
    is heroic, if it's locked for certain player levels, or if it has special restrictions.
    The returned value can be used in bitwise operations to check for specific flag
    states. This method is commonly used when validating player access to different
    map difficulties or determining the appropriate game mechanics for a given difficulty
    level.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with this map difficulty
    entry. Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag definition,
    allowing for bitwise checks to determine individual flag states.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a difficulty is heroic
    code: "MapDifficultyEntry const* difficulty = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(5);\
      \ // Example: Normal 10-player\nif (difficulty && (difficulty->GetFlags() &\
      \ 0x01))\n{\n    // This difficulty has the 'heroic' flag set\n    printf(\"\
      This is a heroic difficulty\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validating player access to a map difficulty
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nMapDifficultyEntry const* difficulty = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(player->GetMap()->GetDifficulty());\n\
      if (difficulty)\n{\n    int flags = difficulty->GetFlags();\n    if (flags &\
      \ 0x04) // Assuming flag 0x04 means 'requires level 80+'\n    {\n        if\
      \ (player->getLevel() < 80)\n        {\n            // Prevent access\n    \
      \        player->SendNotification(\"This difficulty requires level 80 or higher.\"\
      );\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The exact meaning of each bit in the returned flag value is defined in the
    game's database and may vary between different World of Warcraft expansions. Developers
    should consult the relevant DBC files or documentation to understand what each
    flag represents. The method itself is thread-safe as it only reads from a const
    data structure.
  warnings: Be aware that the flag values are not standardized across all TrinityCore
    versions or custom modifications, so hardcoded flag values may not work in all
    installations. Always verify flag meanings against your specific database version.
