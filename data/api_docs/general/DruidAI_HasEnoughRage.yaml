documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Druid has enough rage to perform an action
  description: The HasEnoughRage method evaluates whether the current Druid AI unit
    possesses sufficient rage energy to execute a specified ability or spell. This
    method is commonly used within the Druid's AI behavior system to determine if
    a rage-based attack or ability can be safely cast. The check considers the unit's
    current rage amount against the required rage threshold, which is typically defined
    by the specific spell or ability being evaluated. This functionality is essential
    for proper AI decision-making in combat scenarios where rage management is crucial.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Druid has equal to or greater than the required rage
    amount; otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughRage(20)) {\n    druidAI->CastSpell(SPELL_MANGLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Rage Before Using Berserk Ability
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughRage(50) && druidAI->GetHealthPercent() < 30) {\n\
      \    druidAI->CastSpell(SPELL_BERSERK);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the underlying unit's rage tracking system
    and may be called frequently during combat AI updates. The exact rage requirement
    for each ability should be determined by the spell's definition in the game database.
  warnings: Ensure that the method is only called when the Druid AI unit is in a valid
    combat state, as calling it outside of combat may produce unexpected results.
    The method does not account for temporary rage modifications or buffs that might
    affect the actual usable rage amount.
