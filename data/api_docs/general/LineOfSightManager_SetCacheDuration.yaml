  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: SetCacheDuration
  signature: void LineOfSightManager::SetCacheDuration(uint32 durationMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cache duration for line-of-sight calculations in milliseconds.
  description: The SetCacheDuration method configures how long line-of-sight results
    are cached before being recalculated. This is used to optimize performance by
    avoiding redundant calculations when the same or similar positions are queried
    repeatedly. The cache duration is specified in milliseconds and affects all subsequent
    line-of-sight checks performed by the LineOfSightManager instance. Setting a longer
    duration can improve performance but may result in outdated results if the environment
    changes frequently.
  parameters:
  - name: durationMs
    description: The cache duration in milliseconds. Specifies how long to retain
      cached line-of-sight results before recalculating them.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = new LineOfSightManager();

      losManager->SetCacheDuration(500); // Cache for 500ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Optimization
    code: 'LineOfSightManager* losManager = World::GetLosManager();

      losManager->SetCacheDuration(1000); // Cache for 1 second to reduce frequent
      recalculations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects all line-of-sight queries made through the manager instance.
    The cache is typically implemented using a time-based expiration mechanism, where
    cached results are invalidated after the specified duration has elapsed. This
    is particularly useful in high-frequency scenarios such as AI pathfinding or spell
    targeting.
