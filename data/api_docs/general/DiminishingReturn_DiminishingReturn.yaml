documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DiminishingReturn object with default values.
  description: The DiminishingReturn constructor initializes a new instance of the
    DiminishingReturn class. This class is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    to manage diminishing returns for various debuffs and crowd control effects. The
    constructor sets up internal state variables and prepares the object for use in
    tracking the diminishing return mechanics that reduce the effectiveness of repeated
    applications of the same effect on a target. It ensures proper initialization
    before any gameplay logic involving diminishing returns is executed.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Construction
    code: 'DiminishingReturn dr;

      // Creates a new DiminishingReturn object with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when creating
    new diminishing return tracking objects. Developers should not need to manually
    instantiate this class unless implementing custom gameplay mechanics that require
    direct control over diminishing return behavior.
