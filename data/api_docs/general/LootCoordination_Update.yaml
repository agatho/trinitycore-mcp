  method: Update
  signature: void LootCoordination::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot coordination state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method processes and manages the state of loot coordination
    within the game world. It handles timing-based operations such as loot roll timeouts,
    coordination status updates, and cleanup of expired loot requests. This method
    is typically called from the main game loop to ensure that loot coordination mechanics
    function properly in real-time. The method uses the provided time delta (diff)
    to determine how much time has passed since the last update and performs necessary
    actions accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'LootCoordination lootCoord;

      uint32 diff = 100; // 100ms elapsed

      lootCoord.Update(diff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the game's main update loop.
    The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since last update and affects timing-sensitive
    operations like loot roll timeouts.
