  class: QuestValidation

  signature: bool QuestValidation::IsQuestLogFull(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player's quest log is full and cannot accept additional
    quests.
  description: The IsQuestLogFull method determines if a player has reached the maximum
    number of active quests allowed in their quest log. In World of Warcraft, players
    can only carry a limited number of active quests at any given time, typically
    25 quests. This method evaluates the current state of the player's quest log and
    returns true if no more quests can be accepted, or false if there is still space
    available. The check considers all active quests including those that are completed
    but not turned in yet. This functionality is crucial for quest management systems
    and botting logic to prevent attempting to accept quests when the log is full.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose quest log status is being checked.
      Must be a valid player instance, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: Returns true if the player's quest log is full and cannot accept additional
    quests, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest log capacity
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nif (QuestValidation::IsQuestLogFull(player))\
      \ {\n    // Handle case when quest log is full\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Your quest log is full.\");\n} else {\n    // Proceed with accepting new quests\n\
      \    // ... quest acceptance logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in bot quest acceptance logic
    code: "class QuestBot {\npublic:\n    void AcceptNextAvailableQuest(Player* bot)\
      \ {\n        if (!QuestValidation::IsQuestLogFull(bot)) {\n            // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance\n            // ... logic to find and accept quest\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Log warning or handle full quest log\n   \
      \         sLog->outString(\"[QuestBot] Quest log is full for player %s\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the internal quest log tracking system
    in TrinityCore. The maximum number of quests allowed may vary depending on game
    version or server configuration. Performance is generally low as it only involves
    checking a simple counter or list size, but could be called frequently in automated
    systems.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior will occur. This method should not be used
    to determine if a specific quest can be accepted without first verifying that
    the quest is available and meets other prerequisites.
