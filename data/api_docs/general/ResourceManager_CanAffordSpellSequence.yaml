  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient resources to cast a sequence of spells
  description: The CanAffordSpellSequence method evaluates whether the current player
    entity possesses enough in-game resources (such as mana, rage, energy, or other
    spell costs) to execute a series of spells identified by their unique spell IDs.
    This method is typically used during spell casting validation to prevent players
    from attempting to cast spells they cannot afford, ensuring game balance and proper
    resource management. The method considers the cumulative cost of all spells in
    the sequence and compares it against the player's current resource pool. It does
    not modify any state or consume resources itself, but rather serves as a predictive
    check for spell affordability.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has sufficient resources to cast all spells
    in the sequence; returns false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that
    at least one spell in the sequence cannot be afforded given the current resource
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Sequence Affordability Check
    code: "if (resourceManager.CanAffordSpellSequence({12345, 67890, 54321})) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with casting the spell sequence\n    player.CastSpellSequence({12345,\
      \ 67890, 54321});\n} else {\n    // Notify player they cannot afford the sequence\n\
      \    player.SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough resources to cast this spell sequence.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal state of the ResourceManager is properly
    initialized with the current player's resource values. It may perform calculations
    based on spell cost modifiers, aura effects, or class-specific resource multipliers
    depending on the implementation details of the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID array passed to this method contains valid spell
    identifiers; invalid IDs could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect affordability
    checks. This method should not be used as a substitute for actual spell casting
    logic, as it only performs a resource check without applying any cost deductions.
