  method: NotifyValueChanged
  signature: void PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase::NotifyValueChanged()
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all registered listeners that a persistent instance script value
    has changed.
  description: The NotifyValueChanged method is used to signal to all registered observers
    or listeners that a value within a PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase object has
    been modified. This method typically triggers updates in the game state, such
    as synchronizing changes across clients, updating database records, or invoking
    callbacks for scripted events. It's an essential part of the persistent instance
    scripting system in TrinityCore, ensuring that changes to instance-related data
    are properly propagated throughout the game environment. The method does not take
    any parameters and performs no direct return operations; instead, it serves as
    a communication mechanism between the value holder and its dependents.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Script
    code: "class MyInstanceScript : public PersistentInstanceScriptValueBase {\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnPlayerEnter(Player* player) override {\n        // Modify some value\n\
      \        SetValue(42);\n        // Notify all listeners of the change\n    \
      \    NotifyValueChanged();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a persistent instance script value
    is modified to ensure proper synchronization. It's typically invoked after setting
    a new value through setter methods. The implementation may involve triggering
    callbacks or updating internal state flags, but the exact behavior depends on
    how the class is extended and used in specific instance scripts.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to desynchronization between clients
    and server state, potentially causing bugs or unexpected behavior in persistent
    instances. Always ensure that changes are made before calling this method to maintain
    data consistency.
