documentation:
  brief: Activates emergency kiting behavior when the player is threatened by multiple
    enemies
  description: The ActivateEmergencyKiting method initiates a defensive kiting strategy
    for the player character when faced with multiple threats. This method is typically
    invoked by the AI system when the KitingManager detects that the player's current
    position puts them at risk due to proximity to several hostile targets. The implementation
    likely triggers movement patterns designed to maintain optimal distance from all
    threats while avoiding dangerous aggro situations. It may also adjust combat behavior,
    such as switching to defensive stances or initiating evasive maneuvers.
  parameters:
  - name: threats
    description: An integer value representing the number of hostile targets currently
      threatening the player character. This parameter determines the intensity and
      type of emergency kiting behavior to be activated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "void AIUpdate()\n{\n    int threatCount = GetThreatCount();\n    if (threatCount\
      \ > 2)\n    {\n        kitingManager.ActivateEmergencyKiting(threatCount);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with threat detection system
    code: "void OnThreatUpdate()\n{\n    // Assume we have a method that counts nearby\
      \ enemies\n    int enemyCount = CountEnemiesInRange(10.0f);\n    \n    if (enemyCount\
      \ >= 3)\n    {\n        // Activate emergency kiting with the number of threats\n\
      \        kitingManager.ActivateEmergencyKiting(enemyCount);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is actually under threat.
    Repeated calls without actual danger may cause unnecessary performance overhead.
    The implementation likely includes internal cooldowns to prevent spamming of emergency
    kiting behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative threat count or zero may result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the threat count parameter accurately reflects
    the number of hostile targets before invoking this method.
