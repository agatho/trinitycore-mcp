  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: IsPositionClear
  signature: bool ObstacleAvoidanceManager::IsPositionClear(const int & pos, float
    radius, const int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position is clear of obstacles within a specified radius.
  description: The IsPositionClear method determines whether a specific location in
    the game world is free from obstacles, such as terrain features or interactive
    objects. It evaluates the area around the provided position using the given radius
    to detect any collisions. This functionality is commonly used in pathfinding and
    AI behavior to ensure that units can safely navigate to target locations without
    being blocked by environmental hazards. The method returns true if no obstacles
    are detected within the specified radius, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position to check for obstacle clearance, represented as an integer
      value (likely a coordinate or identifier).
  - name: radius
    description: The radius around the position to scan for obstacles, specified in
      game units.
  - name: obstacles
    description: A reference to a collection or list of obstacle data that defines
      which objects should be considered as blocking the path.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is clear of obstacles within the
    given radius, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a point is clear
    code: "int position = 12345;\nfloat radius = 5.0f;\nint obstacleList = 67890;\n\
      bool isClear = obstacleAvoidanceManager.IsPositionClear(position, radius, obstacleList);\n\
      if (isClear)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement or action\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs collision detection using internal game engine
    utilities and may cache results for performance optimization. It's important to
    note that the accuracy of this check depends on the quality and completeness of
    the obstacle data provided.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'pos' parameter correctly represents a valid location
    in the game world, as invalid coordinates could lead to unexpected behavior or
    errors during collision detection.
