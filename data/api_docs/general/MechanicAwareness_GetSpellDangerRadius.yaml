  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: GetSpellDangerRadius
  signature: float MechanicAwareness::GetSpellDangerRadius(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the danger radius of a spell based on its ID for mechanic awareness
    calculations.
  description: The GetSpellDangerRadius method retrieves the predefined danger radius
    associated with a specific spell ID. This radius defines the area around a spell's
    target or caster where harmful effects may occur, which is crucial for AI decision-making
    and threat assessment in the game. The method accesses internal spell data structures
    to determine this value, typically used by NPC AI systems to evaluate potential
    threats and avoid dangerous areas. It is commonly employed in pathfinding and
    positioning logic to ensure that units maintain safe distances from known hazardous
    spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the danger radius of the specified spell.
    A value of 0.0f typically indicates that no danger radius is defined for the spell,
    or the spell ID is invalid. Positive values represent the actual radius in yards
    within which the spell's effects are considered dangerous.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Spell Danger Radius
    code: "float radius = mechanicAwareness->GetSpellDangerRadius(12345);\nif (radius\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Spell has a defined danger radius\n    printf(\"Spell danger\
      \ radius: %.2f yards\\n\", radius);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No danger radius defined\
      \ for this spell\n    printf(\"No danger radius defined for spell ID 12345\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Danger Radius for AI Pathfinding
    code: "uint32 spellId = 98765;\nfloat dangerRadius = mechanicAwareness->GetSpellDangerRadius(spellId);\n\
      if (dangerRadius > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Avoid the area around the spell's effect\n\
      \    float safeDistance = dangerRadius + 2.0f; // Add buffer\n    // Implement\
      \ pathfinding logic to stay outside safeDistance\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell database entries and assumes that spell
    data has been properly loaded into memory. The returned radius values are typically
    defined in the spell's database records and may vary based on spell level, caster,
    or other contextual factors. Performance is generally fast as it accesses precomputed
    lookup tables.
  warnings: The method returns 0.0f for invalid spell IDs, which could be misinterpreted
    as a valid zero-radius danger area. Always validate the returned value before
    using it in critical AI logic. Be aware that some spells may not have defined
    danger radii in all game versions or configurations.
