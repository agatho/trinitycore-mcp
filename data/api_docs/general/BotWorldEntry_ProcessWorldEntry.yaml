  method: ProcessWorldEntry
  signature: bool BotWorldEntry::ProcessWorldEntry(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Processes world entry events for bot behavior and updates internal state
    based on time differences.
  description: The ProcessWorldEntry method handles the core logic for updating bot
    behavior in response to world events. It typically processes time-based updates,
    checks for conditions that trigger specific actions, and manages the bot's state
    transitions within the game world. This method is commonly called from the main
    game loop to ensure bots respond appropriately to changing conditions such as
    combat states, movement requirements, or AI decision-making cycles. The method
    uses the provided time difference (diff) parameter to determine how much time
    has passed since the last update and adjusts bot behavior accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the world entry processing completed successfully and the
    bot's state was updated; returns false if processing failed or if no action was
    taken due to conditions not being met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->GetLastTickTime();\n    for\
      \ (auto& bot : botList)\n    {\n        if (bot->ProcessWorldEntry(diff))\n\
      \        {\n            // Bot state updated successfully\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the main game tick loop and should
    not be invoked directly outside of this context. The diff parameter represents
    milliseconds elapsed since last call, which affects timing-sensitive behaviors
    like cooldowns or movement calculations.
