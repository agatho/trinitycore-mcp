  class: ExampleManager
  method: GetCompletedTaskCount
  signature: uint32 ExampleManager::GetCompletedTaskCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of completed tasks associated with the ExampleManager
    instance.
  description: The GetCompletedTaskCount method retrieves and returns the number of
    tasks that have been marked as completed within the context of the ExampleManager.
    This method is typically used in game systems where tracking progress or achievements
    is required, such as quest completion, objective fulfillment, or mission progression.
    The returned value represents a cumulative count and does not include any pending
    or in-progress tasks. This method is read-only and does not modify any internal
    state of the manager.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of completed tasks. Returns
    zero if no tasks have been completed or if the manager has no associated tasks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ExampleManager manager;

      uint32 completedCount = manager.GetCompletedTaskCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO("example", "Completed tasks: %u", completedCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Progress Completion
    code: "ExampleManager* playerManager = sExampleMgr->GetPlayerManager(playerGuid);\n\
      if (playerManager && playerManager->GetCompletedTaskCount() >= 10)\n{\n    //\
      \ Award achievement or reward\n    player->RewardAchievement(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter. It is
    optimized for performance and should not cause significant overhead during regular
    gameplay operations. The method is thread-safe if the underlying data structure
    is properly synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the ExampleManager instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing an uninitialized manager may lead to undefined
    behavior. This method does not validate whether tasks are actually valid or meaningful;
    it simply returns a count of completed items.
