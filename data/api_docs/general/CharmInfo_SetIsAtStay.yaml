  class: CharmInfo
  method: SetIsAtStay
  signature: void CharmInfo::SetIsAtStay(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the charm's stay status to indicate whether it should remain in place
    or follow its owner.
  description: The SetIsAtStay method configures the charm's movement behavior within
    the game world. When set to true, the charm will remain stationary at its current
    location rather than following its owner. This is commonly used for controlling
    pet behavior during combat or when the player wants to keep a summoned creature
    in a specific position. The method directly modifies an internal flag within the
    CharmInfo class that affects how the creature's AI processes movement commands.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the charm should remain at its current
      location (true) or follow its owner (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a charm to stay in place
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetIsAtStay(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Allowing a charm to follow the owner
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetIsAtStay(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the charm's movement behavior and does not directly
    control other aspects of the creature's AI. The change takes effect immediately,
    but may be overridden by other game mechanics such as combat state or spell effects.
