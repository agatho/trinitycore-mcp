  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: CanHealTarget
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::CanHealTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit can heal a target based on line of sight and
    game mechanics.
  description: The CanHealTarget method evaluates if a Unit (such as a player or NPC)
    has a clear line of sight to a specified target and meets the necessary conditions
    for performing a healing action. This includes checking for obstacles, distance
    limitations, and other in-game constraints that would prevent successful healing.
    The method is typically used by AI systems or game logic to validate healing actions
    before execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has clear line of sight to the target and all
    preconditions for healing are met; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (lineOfSightManager->CanHealTarget(targetUnit)) {\n    // Perform healing\
      \ action\n    unit->Heal(targetUnit, healAmount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with healing spell logic
    code: "void CastHealSpell(Unit* healer, Unit* target) {\n    if (lineOfSightManager->CanHealTarget(target))\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with spell casting\n        healer->CastSpell(target,\
      \ HEAL_SPELL_ID, true);\n    } else {\n        // Handle failed healing attempt\n\
      \        healer->SendSpellFailed(SPELL_FAILED_NO_LINE_OF_SIGHT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying line-of-sight system and may be affected
    by terrain, object placement, and unit positioning. It does not account for mana
    or cooldown states of the healer.
  warnings: The method assumes that the target is valid and accessible. Calling this
    method with a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
