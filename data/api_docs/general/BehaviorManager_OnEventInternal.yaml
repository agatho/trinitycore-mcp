documentation:
  brief: Processes internal behavior events for AI-controlled entities within the
    TrinityCore framework
  description: The OnEventInternal method serves as a core callback handler in the
    BehaviorManager class, responsible for processing various internal events that
    occur during AI behavior execution. This method is typically invoked by the game's
    AI system when specific conditions or triggers are met, allowing behaviors to
    respond dynamically to changing circumstances such as combat states, environmental
    changes, or NPC-specific events. The method operates internally within the AI
    framework and does not directly expose external interfaces, making it crucial
    for maintaining proper behavior state management and event-driven responses in
    scripted AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter representing the event identifier or type that
      triggered this internal callback. This value typically corresponds to predefined
      event constants within the BehaviorManager's event system, determining how the
      behavior should process and respond to the specific event occurrence.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void MyBehavior::OnEventInternal(const int& eventId)\n{\n    switch (eventId)\n\
      \    {\n        case BEHAVIOR_EVENT_COMBAT_ENTER:\n            // Handle entering\
      \ combat\n            break;\n        case BEHAVIOR_EVENT_COMBAT_EXIT:\n   \
      \         // Handle exiting combat\n            break;\n        default:\n \
      \           break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI event processing pipeline and should
    not be called directly from external modules. The parameter value represents a
    predefined event type that must match registered behavior handlers to ensure proper
    execution flow.
  warnings: Improper handling of event types in this method can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes within the AI subsystem. Developers should ensure all possible
    event values are properly handled to prevent uncaught exceptions or missed events.
