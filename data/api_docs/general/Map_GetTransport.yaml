  class: Map
  method: GetTransport
  signature: Transport * Map::GetTransport(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a transport object by its unique identifier (GUID) from the map.
  description: The GetTransport method is used to fetch a specific transport object
    from the Map class based on its GUID. This method is essential for managing transport
    objects within the game world, particularly in scenarios involving player movement
    or vehicle mechanics. It allows developers to access and manipulate transport
    entities that are part of the map's data structure, ensuring proper handling of
    transport-related gameplay elements. The method operates under the assumption
    that the GUID corresponds to a valid transport entity within the current map.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the transport object to retrieve.
      This parameter must be a valid GUID that corresponds to an existing transport
      in the map, otherwise the method will return nullptr.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Transport object associated with the given GUID.
    If no such transport exists, or if the GUID is invalid, the method returns nullptr.
    The returned pointer may be null, indicating that no transport was found for the
    specified GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Transport* transport = map->GetTransport(guid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for valid transport before use
    code: "Transport* transport = map->GetTransport(guid);\nif (transport != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the transport object\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe in the context of the Map class, but requires careful
    handling when dealing with transport objects that may be modified by other threads.
    Performance considerations should be taken into account when repeatedly calling
    this method during gameplay loops.
  warnings: This method should not be used to retrieve transport objects without checking
    for null returns. Using a nullptr transport object can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior in game mechanics. Additionally, the GUID must be valid and correspond
    to an existing transport entity.
