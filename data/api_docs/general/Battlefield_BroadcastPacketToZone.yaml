documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all players within the battlefield's zone.
  description: The BroadcastPacketToZone method broadcasts a WorldPacket to all players
    currently present in the battlefield's zone. This function is typically used for
    sending updates, notifications, or game state changes that affect all players
    in the active battlefield area. The method ensures that packets are only sent
    to players who are within the defined boundaries of the battlefield, optimizing
    network traffic by avoiding unnecessary transmissions to players outside the zone.
    It operates as a const method, indicating it does not modify the battlefield's
    internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket object containing the data to be broadcasted
      to all players in the battlefield zone. The packet must be properly constructed
      with valid opcode and payload before being passed to this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Battlefield Update
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS, 20);

      packet << uint8(1); // Battlefield ID

      packet << uint32(12345); // Player count

      battlefield->BroadcastPacketToZone(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to efficiently send packets only to players within
    the battlefield's active zone. It leverages internal player tracking mechanisms
    to determine which players are eligible for receiving the packet, ensuring optimal
    performance and network usage.
