documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all LFG dungeon data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadLFGDungeons method is responsible for loading all available
    Looking For Group (LFG) dungeon entries from the database into the in-memory data
    structures of the LFG manager. This method is typically called during server startup
    or when the LFG system needs to refresh its dungeon information. It populates
    internal containers with dungeon templates, their associated requirements, rewards,
    and other metadata necessary for player matchmaking and group formation. The method
    ensures that all dungeon data is properly initialized before players can participate
    in LFG activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeLFGSystem()\n{\n    sLFGMgr->LoadLFGDungeons();\n    //\
      \ Dungeon data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    dungeon data needs to be refreshed. It's not thread-safe and should be executed
    in the main thread context. The method relies on database queries to fetch dungeon
    templates, so performance may be affected by database response times.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries. Avoid calling this method during active gameplay
    sessions as it may disrupt ongoing LFG operations.
