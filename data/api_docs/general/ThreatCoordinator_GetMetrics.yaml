  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const ThreatCoordinationMetrics & ThreatCoordinator::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current threat coordination metrics for the ThreatCoordinator
    instance.
  description: The GetMetrics method provides access to a snapshot of the internal
    threat coordination statistics maintained by the ThreatCoordinator. These metrics
    typically include data such as total threat generated, number of mobs affected,
    average threat per target, and other performance-related indicators. This method
    is commonly used for monitoring, debugging, or reporting purposes within the AI
    system that manages mob threat behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
    The returned reference points to an immutable snapshot of metrics, ensuring thread
    safety when accessed from multiple contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a ThreatCoordinationMetrics object containing current
    statistics about threat coordination activity. This structure holds read-only
    data representing the state of threat management within the coordinator.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const ThreatCoordinationMetrics& metrics = threatCoordinator.GetMetrics();

      uint32 totalThreat = metrics.total_threat_generated;

      uint32 affectedMobs = metrics.mobs_affected;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Debugging and Logging
    code: "const ThreatCoordinationMetrics& metrics = threatCoordinator.GetMetrics();\n\
      TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"ai.threat\", \"Threat Coordination Metrics - Total Threat: %u,\
      \ Affected Mobs: %u\",\n             metrics.total_threat_generated,\n     \
      \        metrics.mobs_affected);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ThreatCoordinationMetrics object is a snapshot and will not
    reflect changes made to the internal state after the call. This method is designed
    to be lightweight and thread-safe, making it suitable for frequent calls in performance-critical
    sections of AI code.
