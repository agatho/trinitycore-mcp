  class: TargetSelector
  method: IsInRange
  signature: bool TargetSelector::IsInRange(Unit * target, float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a target unit is within the specified range of the selector.
  description: The IsInRange method determines whether a given Unit target falls within
    a defined distance range from the TargetSelector's position. This utility function
    is commonly used in AI behavior trees and spell targeting logic to validate proximity
    constraints before executing actions or casting spells. The method performs a
    simple Euclidean distance check between the selector's current location and the
    target unit's location, taking into account the unit's bounding radius for more
    accurate collision detection. It returns true if the target is within range, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that needs to be checked for range proximity.
      Must not be null.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance allowed between the selector and the target
      unit. Should be a positive floating-point value representing meters.
  returns: Returns true if the target unit is within the specified range from the
    selector, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Range Check
    code: "if (targetSelector.IsInRange(targetUnit, 30.0f)) {\n    // Target is within\
      \ 30 yards\n    DoAttack();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Target Validation
    code: "if (targetSelector.IsInRange(spellTarget, spellInfo->GetMaxRange())) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with spell casting\n    caster->CastSpell(spellTarget, spellId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer or find another target\n    targetSelector.SelectNearestTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the unit's bounding radius for accurate distance calculation.
    It is typically used in conjunction with other AI decision-making logic to ensure
    valid targeting before action execution. The range check is performed using a
    simple Euclidean distance formula, which may not account for complex terrain or
    obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. Be aware that the range calculation includes
    the unit's bounding radius, so targets might be considered in-range even if their
    visual position appears slightly outside the specified distance.
