  class: ConversationAI
  method: SetData
  signature: void ConversationAI::SetData(uint32 id, uint32 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets internal data values for a conversation AI instance based on provided
    ID and value parameters.
  description: 'The SetData method in the ConversationAI class is used to configure
    or update internal state variables within a conversation AI handler. This method
    accepts two uint32 parameters: an identifier (id) that specifies which data field
    to modify, and a value that contains the new data to be set. It allows for dynamic
    control over conversation behavior and state during runtime, such as enabling/disabling
    specific dialogue options or setting flags that influence how the AI responds
    to player interactions. The method does not return any value and is typically
    invoked by game systems or scripts when conversation state needs to be adjusted
    programmatically.'
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: A unique identifier specifying which internal data field or parameter
      to update within the ConversationAI instance. This ID corresponds to predefined
      data slots used internally by the AI system.
  - name: value
    description: The new value to assign to the specified data field identified by
      'id'. The meaning and valid range of this value depend on the context of the
      specific data slot being modified.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable a specific conversation option
    code: 'ConversationAI* ai = (ConversationAI*)creature->GetAI();

      ai->SetData(1001, 1); // Enable option with ID 1001'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update conversation state flag
    code: 'ConversationAI* ai = (ConversationAI*)player->GetAI();

      ai->SetData(2005, 3); // Set state flag to 3 for advanced dialogue progression'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework in TrinityCore and should only be
    called on valid ConversationAI instances. The internal mapping between 'id' values
    and their corresponding data fields must be known or documented to ensure correct
    usage. Modifying data incorrectly may lead to unexpected behavior in conversation
    flow.
  warnings: Calling SetData with invalid ID values may cause undefined behavior or
    crashes if the AI system does not validate inputs properly. Always verify that
    the target ConversationAI instance is valid before calling this method.
