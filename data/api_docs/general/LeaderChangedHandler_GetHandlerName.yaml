documentation:
  brief: Returns the name of the LeaderChangedHandler event handler
  description: The GetHandlerName method retrieves the string identifier associated
    with the LeaderChangedHandler class. This method is typically used within the
    TrinityCore framework to uniquely identify event handlers for group leadership
    changes. The returned string serves as a key for registering and managing event
    callbacks in the game's event system. This handler is commonly invoked when a
    player's leadership status changes within a group or raid context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique name identifier of the LeaderChangedHandler,
    typically representing the handler's purpose or class name
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LeaderChangedHandler handler;

      std::string handlerName = handler.GetHandlerName();

      printf("Handler name: %s\n", handlerName.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to return a constant string value that uniquely identifies
    the handler within the TrinityCore event system. The implementation should be
    thread-safe as it may be called from different threads during event processing.
