  signature: void BattlePetManager::InitializeAbilityDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the battle pet ability database with all available pet abilities
    and their properties.
  description: The InitializeAbilityDatabase method sets up the internal database
    of battle pet abilities used by the BattlePetManager. This method is responsible
    for loading and preparing all pet ability data, including their names, descriptions,
    cooldowns, effects, and other relevant properties. It typically runs during server
    startup or when the battle pet system is first initialized. The method ensures
    that all pet abilities are properly registered and accessible for use in battle
    scenarios, including both base game abilities and any custom or expansion-specific
    abilities. This initialization process is crucial for maintaining accurate pet
    behavior and ensuring that all battle mechanics function correctly.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'BattlePetManager* petManager = sObjectAccessor->GetBattlePetManager();

      petManager->InitializeAbilityDatabase();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during system initialization. Re-initializing
    the database may cause data corruption or duplicate entries. The method is typically
    invoked automatically by the BattlePetManager constructor or during server startup
    routines.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times can lead to memory leaks or corrupted
    ability data. It should never be called after the battle pet system has been fully
    initialized and abilities are actively being used in battles.
