  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleModSpellCategoryCooldown
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleModSpellCategoryCooldown(const AuraApplication
    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the cooldown time for spells belonging to a specific category.
  description: The HandleModSpellCategoryCooldown method adjusts the cooldown duration
    of spells that belong to a specified spell category. This is typically used in
    aura effects that modify how quickly certain types of spells can be cast again.
    The modification can either increase or decrease the cooldown based on the 'apply'
    parameter and the aura's properties. This method interacts with the spell system
    to enforce cooldown changes at the application and removal of auras.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      the aura being applied or removed. Used to determine which spell category and
      how the cooldown should be modified.
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies the mode of operation for the cooldown modification. Values
      typically indicate whether the effect is being applied (1) or removed (0), though
      exact values may depend on implementation details.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the cooldown modification. When true, the aura's cooldown effects are added;
      when false, they are removed.
  returns: null

  - title: Applying a Spell Category Cooldown Modifier
    code: "void ApplyCooldownAura(AuraEffect* aura) {\n    AuraApplication* app =\
      \ aura->GetBase();\n    aura->HandleModSpellCategoryCooldown(app, 1, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing a Spell Category Cooldown Modifier
    code: "void RemoveCooldownAura(AuraEffect* aura) {\n    AuraApplication* app =\
      \ aura->GetBase();\n    aura->HandleModSpellCategoryCooldown(app, 0, false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system in TrinityCore and directly
    affects spell cooldown calculations. It should be called only during aura application
    or removal events to ensure proper synchronization with the game's spell system.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method, such as calling it outside of aura application
    context, may lead to incorrect spell behavior or unexpected cooldown modifications.
    Ensure that the provided AuraApplication is valid and properly initialized before
    calling this method.
