    priority, int targetGuid, int range, int angle, std::string reason, std::string
    sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a movement request to chase a target player with specified parameters.
  description: The MakeChaseMovement method generates a MovementRequest object that
    instructs a bot to move in pursuit of a specific target player. This method is
    typically used in AI-driven gameplay scenarios where bots need to follow or engage
    other players within a defined range and angle. The generated movement request
    includes priority, target identification, movement constraints, and contextual
    information for logging or debugging purposes. It's commonly employed in player-versus-player
    (PvP) bot behaviors or quest-related movement logic.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: Specifies the movement priority level (PlayerBotMovementPriority
      enum). Higher priority movements will be executed before lower priority ones.
      Valid values typically include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and IMMEDIATE.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target player to chase. This
      is used to track and locate the specific player in the game world.
  - name: range
    description: Maximum distance in yards within which the bot will attempt to chase
      the target. A value of 0 typically means no range limit.
  - name: angle
    description: Angular constraint in degrees for movement direction relative to
      the target. A value of 0 means no angular restriction, while higher values restrict
      movement to a cone around the target.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why this chase movement was initiated.
      Useful for debugging and logging purposes.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: Identifies the system or module that originated this movement request.
      Helps in tracking which part of the codebase triggered the chase behavior.
  returns: Returns a MovementRequest object configured with the specified parameters
    to initiate chasing behavior towards the target player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chase Movement
    code: MovementRequest request = MovementRequest::MakeChaseMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::HIGH,
      123456, 30, 0, "Pursuing enemy", "PvP Bot");
    language: cpp
  - title: Chase with Angular Restriction
    code: MovementRequest request = MovementRequest::MakeChaseMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::MEDIUM,
      789012, 50, 45, "Flanking target", "Advanced AI");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's player bot framework and assumes
    that the target player exists in the game world. The movement request will only
    be processed if the bot has sufficient permissions and resources to execute the
    chase behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetGuid corresponds to an actual player in the game
    world, otherwise the movement may fail or cause unexpected behavior. Be cautious
    with high priority settings as they can override other important movements.
