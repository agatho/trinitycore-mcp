  class: FormationManager
  method: GetMetrics
  signature: const FormationMetrics & FormationManager::GetMetrics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the formation metrics structure containing performance and behavioral
    statistics for the formation manager.
  description: The GetMetrics method returns a constant reference to the FormationMetrics
    object that holds statistical data about the formation manager's operations. This
    includes information such as the number of units managed, update frequencies,
    processing times, and other relevant performance indicators. The returned metrics
    are typically used for debugging, performance monitoring, or administrative purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not modify any internal state
    and is safe to call from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a FormationMetrics object containing detailed statistics
    about formation manager operations including unit counts, update timing, and processing
    metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'const FormationMetrics& metrics = formationManager.GetMetrics();

      uint32 unitCount = metrics.unitCount;

      uint32 updateFrequency = metrics.updateFrequency;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "void LogFormationStats(FormationManager& manager) {\n    const FormationMetrics&\
      \ metrics = manager.GetMetrics();\n    sLog->outString(\"Formation Stats - Units:\
      \ %u, Updates/sec: %u, Avg Time: %.2f ms\",\n                   metrics.unitCount,\n\
      \                   metrics.updateFrequency,\n                   static_cast<double>(metrics.averageUpdateTime)\
      \ / 1000.0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned FormationMetrics reference is valid only until the next call
    to a non-const method on the FormationManager object. This method is thread-safe
    and can be called from any thread without synchronization.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned FormationMetrics object as it's const. Modifications
    would have no effect on the internal state of the FormationManager.
