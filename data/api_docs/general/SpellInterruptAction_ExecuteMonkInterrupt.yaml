  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: ExecuteMonkInterrupt
  signature: ActionResult SpellInterruptAction::ExecuteMonkInterrupt(BotAI * ai, ::Unit
    * target, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a monk's interrupt action on a target unit using the specified spell
    ID.
  description: The ExecuteMonkInterrupt method performs an interrupt action specific
    to monk class characters within the TrinityCore AI framework. It attempts to interrupt
    the target unit's current cast using the provided spell ID, which is typically
    a monk ability such as 'Chi Burst' or 'Spear Hand Strike'. The method integrates
    with the BotAI system to control bot behavior and ensure proper execution of combat
    actions. This function is part of the general AI action category and handles the
    logic for when and how a monk should interrupt enemy spellcasting during combat
    encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance controlling the monk bot. Used to access
      AI state, target information, and execute actions within the bot's context.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target unit to be interrupted.
      Must be a valid target within the bot's range and line of sight.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the spell to use for interrupting the
      target. Should correspond to a valid monk interrupt ability such as 115072 (Spear
      Hand Strike) or 137639 (Chi Burst).
  returns: ActionResult indicating the success or failure of the interrupt action
    execution. Possible return values include SUCCESS, FAILED, or PENDING depending
    on whether the interrupt was successfully cast, failed due to conditions, or is
    still in progress.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Monk Interrupt Usage
    code: "ActionResult result = interruptAction.ExecuteMonkInterrupt(ai, targetUnit,\
      \ 115072); // Interrupt with Spear Hand Strike\nif (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS)\
      \ {\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n    ai->GetBot()->SetTarget(targetUnit);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Monk Interrupt
    code: "if (targetUnit && targetUnit->IsNonMeleeSpellCasted()) {\n    ActionResult\
      \ result = interruptAction.ExecuteMonkInterrupt(ai, targetUnit, 137639); //\
      \ Chi Burst\n    if (result == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n        ai->GetBot()->CastSpell(targetUnit,\
      \ 137639, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has sufficient mana and that the target
    is within casting range. The spell ID must correspond to a valid monk interrupt
    ability. The AI system should ensure that the bot's current state allows for interrupt
    actions, such as not being in a movement or casting state.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to an actual monk interrupt
    spell; otherwise, the action will fail silently. Also, verify that target is valid
    and within range before calling this method to avoid errors.
