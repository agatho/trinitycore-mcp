documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum number of players required per team in the battleground.
  description: The GetMinPlayersPerTeam method retrieves the minimum player count
    needed for a battleground to start. This value determines how many players are
    required on each team before the battleground can begin. The method is typically
    used during battleground queue processing and matchmaking to ensure sufficient
    player participation. It returns a uint16 value representing the number of players
    per team, which varies depending on the specific battleground type and its configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value indicating the minimum number of players required per team
    for the battleground to start. This value is typically 10 for most battlegrounds
    like Alterac Valley or Eye of the Storm, but can vary depending on the specific
    battleground template.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(BGTypeId::BG_AV);

      uint16 minPlayers = bgTemplate->GetMinPlayersPerTeam();

      printf("Minimum players per team: %u\n", minPlayers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Validity Before Start
    code: "BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(BGTypeId::BG_WS);\n\
      uint16 minPlayers = bgTemplate->GetMinPlayersPerTeam();\nif (minPlayers > 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Battleground requires at least %u players per team\\n\", minPlayers);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground template system and should be called
    on valid battleground templates. The returned value is typically configured in
    the database or hardcoded in the battleground template definitions. This value
    directly affects matchmaking logic and queue behavior.
