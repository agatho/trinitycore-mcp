  class: MovementArbiter
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const MovementArbiterStatistics & MovementArbiter::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current movement statistics from the MovementArbiter instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a snapshot of movement-related
    performance and operational data maintained by the MovementArbiter. This includes
    metrics such as update counts, processing times, and other diagnostic information
    that can be used for monitoring or debugging movement behavior in the game world.
    The returned reference is const, ensuring that the statistics cannot be modified
    through this interface. The method does not require any parameters and returns
    a constant reference to a MovementArbiterStatistics object which encapsulates
    all relevant statistical data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a MovementArbiterStatistics structure containing
    current movement-related statistics including update counts, timing data, and
    operational metrics. The returned object should not be modified as it's a const
    reference.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Movement Statistics
    code: 'const MovementArbiter& arbiter = ...; // Assume arbiter is initialized

      const MovementArbiterStatistics& stats = arbiter.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Updates: " << stats.totalUpdates << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Average Update Time: " << stats.averageUpdateTime.count() << "
      ms" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned statistics object is valid only until the next call to GetStatistics
    or until the MovementArbiter instance is modified. Since it's a const reference,
    any modifications to the internal state of the statistics must be handled internally
    by the MovementArbiter class. This method is typically used for performance monitoring
    and debugging purposes.
