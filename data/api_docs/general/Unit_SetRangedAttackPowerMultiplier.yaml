  method: SetRangedAttackPowerMultiplier
  signature: void Unit::SetRangedAttackPowerMultiplier(float attackPowerMult)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ranged attack power multiplier for the unit.
  description: This method modifies the ranged attack power multiplier value for a
    Unit object, which affects how much damage a unit's ranged attacks will deal.
    The multiplier is applied to the base ranged attack power calculation and influences
    the overall damage output of ranged weapons. This method is typically used in
    game mechanics to adjust combat performance or modify specific unit behaviors
    during encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: attackPowerMult
    description: The multiplier value to apply to the ranged attack power. This value
      determines how much additional damage will be added to the unit's ranged attacks
      based on their base attack power.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetRangedAttackPowerMultiplier(1.5f);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects the internal calculation of ranged damage and
    should be used carefully when modifying combat behavior in game scripts or encounters.
    It may not directly affect the actual attack power value but rather the multiplier
    applied to it.
