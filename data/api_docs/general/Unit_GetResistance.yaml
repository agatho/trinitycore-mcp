  method: GetResistance
  signature: int32 Unit::GetResistance(int mask) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the resistance value for a specified mask
  description: The GetResistance method retrieves the resistance value for a given
    mask from the Unit's resistance stats. This method is commonly used in World of
    Warcraft to determine how much resistance a unit has against specific damage types
    or spells. The mask parameter specifies which resistance type to retrieve, and
    the method returns an integer value representing the resistance amount. This functionality
    is essential for calculating damage reduction and determining the effectiveness
    of spells against different resistance types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value representing the resistance amount for the specified
    mask. A value of 0 indicates no resistance, while positive values indicate resistance
    to that specific type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: int32 resistance = unit->GetResistance(1 << 0); // Get fire resistance
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();

      int32 fireResist = target->GetResistance(1 << 2);

      int32 natureResist = target->GetResistance(1 << 4);

      int32 holyResist = target->GetResistance(1 << 5);

      int32 shadowResist = target->GetResistance(1 << 6);

      int32 arcaneResist = target->GetResistance(1 << 7);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other resistance-related
    functions to calculate damage reduction. The mask parameter uses bit flags to
    represent different resistance types, making it efficient for checking multiple
    resistance types simultaneously.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may return 0 if the unit has
    no resistance against a particular type, which could lead to incorrect damage
    calculations in combat scenarios.
