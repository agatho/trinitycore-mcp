    This check is typically used to control access to gathering activities based on
    game rules, expansion settings, or server configurations. The method returns a
    boolean value indicating the state of the gathering system. It does not require
    any parameters and provides a quick way to validate whether players can engage
    in gathering actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if gathering is enabled; otherwise, returns false. This indicates
    whether players are allowed to perform gathering activities like mining ore, harvesting
    herbs, or skinning creatures.

    code: "if (GatheringManager::IsGatheringEnabled()) {\n    // Allow player to gather\
      \ resources\n    player->SendGatherSkillUpdate();\n} else {\n    // Prevent\
      \ gathering actions\n    player->SendGatherDisabled();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal server flags or configuration settings
    related to the gathering system. It may be called frequently during gameplay,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency contexts.
