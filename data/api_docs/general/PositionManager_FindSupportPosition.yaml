  signature: int PositionManager::FindSupportPosition(const int & groupMembers)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal support position for a group based on
    member count
  description: The FindSupportPosition method determines the most suitable positioning
    strategy for a group of players in a World of Warcraft scenario, particularly
    relevant for battlegrounds or group-based encounters. It evaluates the number
    of group members provided as input and returns an integer identifier representing
    the calculated support position. This position is typically used to determine
    where non-combatant players should be positioned relative to the main combat action.
    The method likely considers factors such as group size, positioning efficiency,
    and game mechanics like line of sight or optimal engagement distance.
  parameters:
  - name: groupMembers
    description: The number of members in the player group (positive integer). Represents
      the total count of players that need to be positioned for support.
  returns: An integer value representing the calculated support position identifier.
    The exact meaning of this value depends on internal logic but typically corresponds
    to a predefined position index or coordinate system used by the game engine for
    group positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int supportPos = positionManager.FindSupportPosition(5); // Calculates support
      position for a group of 5 players
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with group management
    code: 'uint8 playerCount = playerGroup->GetMembersCount();

      int optimalPosition = positionManager.FindSupportPosition(playerCount);

      playerGroup->SetSupportPosition(optimalPosition);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger positioning system and may be called
    during group formation, battleground setup, or encounter initialization. The implementation
    might cache results for performance optimization when the same group size is queried
    repeatedly.
  warnings: The method signature shows a const reference to an int parameter which
    may be misleading if the method modifies internal state based on this value. Ensure
    that the input value represents a valid player count (typically > 0) to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
