  class: DependencyValidator
  method: ValidatePhmap
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::ValidatePhmap()
documentation:
  brief: Validates the presence and integrity of the phmap dependency within the TrinityCore
    environment.
  description: The ValidatePhmap method checks whether the required phmap (parallel
    hash map) library is properly installed, accessible, and functioning correctly
    within the TrinityCore framework. This validation ensures that all components
    relying on phmap for efficient data structures and concurrent operations can execute
    without runtime errors. The method typically performs checks such as verifying
    library version compatibility, confirming memory allocation success, and ensuring
    thread-safe access patterns are maintained. It is commonly invoked during system
    initialization or module loading to prevent failures caused by missing or corrupted
    dependencies.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the phmap dependency is successfully validated and all
    checks pass; otherwise returns false if any validation step fails or the dependency
    cannot be located.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Initialization
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->ValidatePhmap()) {\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to validate phmap dependency. Exiting...\");\n    exit(1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform runtime checks that could impact startup time. It
    is recommended to call this during early initialization phases rather than in
    performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: If this method returns false, attempting to use phmap-dependent features
    will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure proper error
    handling when calling this function.
