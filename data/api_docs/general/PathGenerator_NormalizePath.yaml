documentation:
  brief: Normalizes the path by removing duplicate points and ensuring valid navigation
    waypoints.
  description: The NormalizePath method processes the internal path stored within
    the PathGenerator class to eliminate redundant or invalid waypoints. This operation
    ensures that subsequent pathfinding calculations and movement execution are optimized
    and do not encounter unnecessary detours or conflicting navigation data. The method
    typically removes consecutive duplicate points, adjusts for minor positional inaccuracies,
    and validates that all remaining waypoints are within acceptable navigation boundaries.
    It is commonly invoked after path generation to prepare the path for use in character
    movement routines.

  - title: Basic Path Normalization
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume pathGen has been populated with waypoints

      pathGen.NormalizePath();

      // Path is now normalized and ready for movement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the PathGenerator object directly.
    It should be called after path generation but before any movement execution to
    ensure optimal performance. The normalization process may alter the original waypoint
    sequence slightly to maintain navigational integrity.
