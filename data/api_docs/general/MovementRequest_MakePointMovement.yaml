  signature: MovementRequest MovementRequest::MakePointMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority
    priority, const int & targetPos, bool generatePath, int finalOrient, int speed,
    int closeEnoughDistance, std::string reason, std::string sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new MovementRequest for moving to a specific point
    with configurable parameters.
  description: The MakePointMovement method constructs a MovementRequest object that
    defines a movement action towards a target position. It allows specifying movement
    priority, whether to generate a path, final orientation, speed, close-enough distance,
    reason for the movement, and source system. This method is typically used in bot
    AI systems to define navigation behavior. The resulting MovementRequest can be
    queued or processed by the movement system to control character movement in the
    game world.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level of this movement request, determining its placement
      in the movement queue. Higher priority movements are executed before lower priority
      ones.
  - name: targetPos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the target position coordinates.
      This is typically a reference to a position object or coordinate value used
      for destination calculation.
  - name: generatePath
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to calculate and generate a path
      to the target position. If true, the system will compute a valid path; if false,
      movement may be direct without pathfinding.
  - name: finalOrient
    description: Final orientation (in degrees) that the character should face upon
      reaching the destination. Set to -1 or 0 for default behavior.
  - name: speed
    description: Movement speed multiplier or absolute speed value for this movement
      request. Determines how fast the character moves towards the target.
  - name: closeEnoughDistance
    description: Distance threshold in game units that determines when the movement
      is considered complete. If the character gets within this distance to the target,
      the movement stops.
  - name: reason
    description: String describing the reason for this movement request, useful for
      debugging and logging purposes.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: String identifying which system or subsystem initiated this movement
      request. Helps in tracking and categorizing movement requests.
  returns: Returns a new MovementRequest object configured with the specified parameters,
    ready to be added to the movement queue or processed by the AI.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Point Movement
    code: MovementRequest request = MovementRequest::MakePointMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::Normal,
      targetPosition, true, 0, 100, 2, "Move to loot", "LootBot");
    language: cpp
  - title: High Priority Movement with Custom Speed
    code: MovementRequest request = MovementRequest::MakePointMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::High,
      targetPosition, false, 90, 150, 1, "Emergency escape", "EscapeBot");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player bot movement system in TrinityCore. It
    does not directly execute movement but creates a request that can be queued and
    processed by the movement manager. The targetPos parameter must be valid or the
    behavior may be undefined. Path generation requires proper navigation mesh data
    to be available.
  warnings: Incorrect use of the targetPos reference or invalid values for speed and
    distance parameters may cause unexpected movement behavior. Be cautious when setting
    generatePath to false, as it might lead to invalid movement if no direct path
    exists. Always ensure that the reason and sourceSystem strings are meaningful
    for debugging purposes.
