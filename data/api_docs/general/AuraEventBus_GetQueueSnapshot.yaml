  signature: int AuraEventBus::GetQueueSnapshot() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current number of queued aura events in the AuraEventBus.
  description: The GetQueueSnapshot method returns an integer representing the current
    size of the aura event queue within the AuraEventBus. This snapshot provides insight
    into how many aura-related events are currently pending processing. The method
    is typically used for debugging, performance monitoring, or to determine if the
    system is under load from queued aura operations. It does not modify any state
    and returns a read-only count of queued items. The returned value can be zero
    if no events are queued, or it may represent a dynamic count that changes as events
    are added or processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of aura events currently queued for
    processing within the AuraEventBus. A return value of zero indicates no pending
    events, while any positive integer reflects the current queue size.
  examples:
  - title: Check Current Queue Size
    code: "int queuedEvents = auraEventBus.GetQueueSnapshot();\nif (queuedEvents >\
      \ 100)\n{\n    // Log warning about high queue load\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Warning: Aura event queue has %d items\", queuedEvents);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a non-blocking snapshot of the queue size and should
    not be used for synchronization purposes. The value returned is volatile and may
    change immediately after the call, as new events can be added or removed from
    the queue.
