  class: Map
  method: GetUnloadLock
  signature: bool Map::GetUnloadLock(const int & p) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the map is locked for unloading.
  description: This method checks if the map has been marked as locked for unloading,
    preventing it from being removed from memory. The lock mechanism ensures that
    the map remains loaded during critical operations such as player movement or combat
    situations. This is particularly important in World of Warcraft's server architecture
    where maps are dynamically loaded and unloaded based on player activity and game
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is currently locked for unloading, false otherwise.
    A locked map cannot be unloaded until the lock is released.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Map Unload Lock
    code: bool isLocked = map->GetUnloadLock(0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore to manage map lifecycle
    and prevent premature unloading during active gameplay. The lock status affects
    memory management and can influence performance if not properly handled.
  warnings: Improper handling of unload locks may lead to memory leaks or incorrect
    map loading states, potentially causing game crashes or unexpected behavior.
