  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: UpdateMovement
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::UpdateMovement(BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement behavior of a bot following its leader in the World
    of Warcraft AI system.
  description: The UpdateMovement method is responsible for controlling how a bot
    character moves in relation to its designated leader within the TrinityCore AI
    framework. This method typically handles pathfinding, distance maintenance, and
    positioning logic to ensure that the bot follows the leader smoothly while avoiding
    obstacles and maintaining appropriate spacing. It integrates with the broader
    BotAI system to manage group dynamics and movement coordination. The method is
    called regularly during the bot's update cycle and may adjust the bot's movement
    state based on leader position, environmental factors, and combat status.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot's behavior. This
      parameter provides access to the AI context, including leader information, movement
      data, and other relevant state variables needed for determining follow behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Update Loop
    code: "void Bot::Update()\n{\n    if (m_ai)\n        m_ai->GetFollowBehavior()->UpdateMovement(m_ai);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom AI Logic
    code: "class MyBotAI : public BotAI\n{\npublic:\n    void Update()\n    {\n  \
      \      if (HasLeader() && IsFollowing())\n            m_followBehavior->UpdateMovement(this);\n\
      \        // Additional custom logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the bot's main update loop and
    may be called multiple times per game tick. It relies on accurate leader position
    data and should not be called when no valid leader exists. The implementation
    likely uses pathfinding algorithms to navigate around obstacles while maintaining
    formation.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid BotAI instance or leader reference
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot is properly initialized
    with a valid leader before invoking this method.
