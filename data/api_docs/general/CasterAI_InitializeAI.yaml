documentation:
  brief: Initializes the caster AI behavior for a creature, setting up spell casting
    mechanics and AI state.
  description: The InitializeAI method is responsible for setting up the initial state
    and configuration of a caster AI instance. This method is typically called during
    the creation or activation of a creature that uses the CasterAI class. It initializes
    spell casting behaviors, sets up necessary data structures for managing spells,
    and prepares the AI to respond to combat situations. The method ensures that the
    creature's AI is properly configured to use its designated spells according to
    the defined casting rules and cooldowns. This initialization process is crucial
    for ensuring that caster creatures behave correctly in combat scenarios.

  - title: Basic AI Initialization
    code: "void MyCasterCreature::Initialize()\n{\n    // Call base class initialization\n\
      \    CasterAI::InitializeAI();\n    // Additional custom initialization can\
      \ follow\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's lifetime, typically
    when the creature is first spawned or activated. The method does not perform any
    dynamic updates to spell configurations after initialization; changes to spell
    behavior should be handled through other mechanisms.
  warnings: Do not call this method multiple times on the same AI instance as it may
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Ensure that all required spell data
    is properly configured before calling InitializeAI.
