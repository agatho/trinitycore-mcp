  class: Channel
  method: ~Channel
  signature: void Channel::~Channel()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a channel instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The Channel destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    resources allocated to a channel object. This includes removing the channel from
    any internal tracking systems, notifying connected clients of the channel's destruction,
    and freeing memory associated with the channel's data structures. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, channels represent in-game communication
    groups such as guild chat, general chat, or trade channels. The destructor ensures
    that when a channel is no longer needed, it does not leave dangling references
    or cause memory leaks within the server's communication subsystem.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Channel destruction example
    code: 'Channel* channel = new Channel("Guild1", TEAM_ALLIANCE);

      // ... use channel ...

      delete channel; // Triggers ~Channel() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a Channel object goes out of
    scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that the destruction process
    may involve network operations to notify clients, so it should not be called from
    time-critical code paths.
