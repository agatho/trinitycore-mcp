  signature: bool Unit::SetWaterWalking(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables water walking functionality for the unit.
  description: The SetWaterWalking method allows a unit to either enable or disable
    water walking behavior, which permits the unit to walk on water surfaces without
    falling through. This method is commonly used in game mechanics to control player
    or creature movement abilities. When enabled, the unit can walk on water; when
    disabled, the unit will fall through water surfaces. The method returns true if
    the operation was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the water walking state was successfully set, false if
    the operation failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* player = new Unit;\nbool success = player->SetWaterWalking(true);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Water walking enabled\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may affect the unit's movement behavior and could be used in
    conjunction with other movement-related methods. It is typically used for implementing
    game mechanics such as water walking spells or abilities.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in movement
    mechanics, especially when combined with other movement control methods. Care
    should be taken when applying this method to ensure proper game state management.
