documentation:
  brief: Loads access requirements for instances and dungeons from the database into
    memory
  description: The LoadAccessRequirements method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with access requirement information stored in the database. This
    includes dungeon locks, level requirements, quest prerequisites, and other conditions
    that determine whether players can enter specific instances or encounters. The
    method is typically called during server startup or reload operations to ensure
    that all access control rules are properly loaded and available for runtime checks.
    It processes data from tables such as access_requirement and related dungeon difficulty
    tables to build lookup caches used by the instance management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadAccessRequirements();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called automatically during server startup and should not
    typically be invoked manually. The loaded access requirements are cached in memory
    for fast lookup during player entry validation. Performance is optimized through
    efficient data structures that allow O(1) lookups for access checks.
  warnings: Invoking this method multiple times without proper cleanup may cause memory
    leaks or duplicate entries. It should only be called once per server lifecycle,
    typically during initialization or reload operations.
