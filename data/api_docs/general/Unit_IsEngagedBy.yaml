  signature: bool Unit::IsEngagedBy(const Unit * who) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently engaged in combat with a specific
    target.
  description: This method checks if the unit is actively engaged in combat with a
    given unit, meaning that the unit has entered combat with the specified target
    and is maintaining an active engagement state. It typically returns true when
    the unit is in combat with the target, and false otherwise. This method is commonly
    used in game mechanics to determine whether a unit is currently fighting another
    unit or if they are in a combat state with a specific target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is engaged in combat with the specified target,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nbool isEngaged = unit->IsEngagedBy(target);\nif (isEngaged)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is currently engaged in combat with target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal combat state tracking and may not reflect the
    actual combat status if the unit's combat state changes frequently. Performance
    considerations are minimal, as this method typically involves simple state checks.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine whether a unit is in combat
    with any arbitrary target; it only checks for engagement with a specific unit.
