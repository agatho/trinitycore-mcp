  class: AuctionHouse
  method: PlaceAuctionBid
  signature: bool AuctionHouse::PlaceAuctionBid(int * player, uint32 auctionId, uint32
    bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bid on an auction item in the Auction House system.
  description: The PlaceAuctionBid method allows a player to place a bid on an existing
    auction item. It validates that the bid amount is sufficient (higher than the
    current highest bid) and that the player has enough money to cover the bid. If
    successful, the bid is recorded in the auction house database and the player's
    gold balance is adjusted accordingly. This method is typically invoked when a
    player interacts with an auction item through the Auction House interface.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object attempting to place the bid. Must be
      a valid player instance with sufficient funds and proper access rights.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction item on which the bid is being placed.
      This ID must correspond to an active auction in the system.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The amount of gold the player wishes to bid for the auction item.
      Must be greater than the current highest bid to be accepted.
  returns: Returns true if the bid was successfully placed and processed, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate insufficient funds, invalid auction ID, or
    bid amount lower than the current highest bid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Bid Placement
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nuint32 auctionId = 12345;\n\
      uint32 bidAmount = 100000; // 10 gold\nbool success = AuctionHouse::PlaceAuctionBid(&player,\
      \ auctionId, bidAmount);\nif (success) {\n    // Bid accepted\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Bid rejected\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations to update the auction state and
    player gold. It should be called from within a valid game context where player
    data is accessible. The method does not directly send messages to the client;
    UI updates are handled separately by the Auction House system.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Also, verify that the auction ID corresponds to an active auction;
    otherwise, the bid will be rejected. Bid amounts must be validated against the
    minimum increment rules defined in the auction house configuration.
