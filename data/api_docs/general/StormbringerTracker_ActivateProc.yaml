  class: StormbringerTracker
  method: ActivateProc
  signature: void StormbringerTracker::ActivateProc()
documentation:
  brief: Activates the Stormbringer proc effect, triggering its associated abilities
    or modifiers.
  description: The ActivateProc method is responsible for activating the Stormbringer
    weapon enchantment's special ability. This method typically gets called when the
    conditions for the proc are met, such as landing a successful melee hit or performing
    a specific action. It handles the logic to apply effects like damage over time,
    mana regeneration, or other combat-related bonuses. The method is part of the
    StormbringerTracker class which manages the state and behavior of the Stormbringer
    enchantment. This activation usually involves updating internal timers, applying
    buffs or debuffs, and potentially triggering visual or audio effects in the game
    client.

    code: "void SomeCombatHandler::OnPlayerAttack(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (player->HasAura(SPELL_STORMBRINGER_PROC_AURA))\n\
      \    {\n        StormbringerTracker* tracker = player->GetStormbringerTracker();\n\
      \        if (tracker)\n        {\n            tracker->ActivateProc();\n   \
      \     }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the proc conditions are satisfied.
    The StormbringerTracker must be properly initialized before calling this method.
    Consider thread safety if this method is invoked from different execution contexts.
  warnings: Calling ActivateProc without verifying that the proc conditions are met
    may lead to unexpected behavior or game balance issues. Ensure proper state management
    of the tracker object to prevent double activation or invalid states.
