  class: ResourceManager
  method: GetResourceEfficiency
  signature: float ResourceManager::GetResourceEfficiency(ResourceType type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency ratio of a specified resource type
    within the ResourceManager.
  description: The GetResourceEfficiency method retrieves the efficiency value associated
    with a given ResourceType. This value typically represents how effectively resources
    are consumed or generated in the context of game mechanics such as crafting, spell
    casting, or resource management systems. The returned float value is usually normalized
    between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates maximum efficiency and 0.0 indicates
    no efficiency. The method does not require any parameters and internally uses
    the ResourceManager's current state to determine the efficiency for the specified
    resource type.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the efficiency of the specified resource type.
    Values typically range from 0.0 (no efficiency) to 1.0 (maximum efficiency). Returns
    0.0 if the resource type is invalid or not supported by the ResourceManager.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float efficiency = resourceManager->GetResourceEfficiency(ResourceType::GOLD);

      std::cout << "Gold efficiency: " << efficiency << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Efficiency Check
    code: "float manaEfficiency = resourceManager->GetResourceEfficiency(ResourceType::MANA);\n\
      if (manaEfficiency > 0.8f) {\n    // High mana efficiency, optimal spell casting\n\
      \    std::cout << \"High mana efficiency detected.\" << std::endl;\n} else if\
      \ (manaEfficiency < 0.3f) {\n    // Low mana efficiency, consider resource conservation\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Low mana efficiency detected.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other ResourceManager functions
    to dynamically adjust gameplay mechanics based on resource availability and efficiency.
    It may be called frequently during gameplay, so performance considerations should
    be taken into account when implementing or using this function.
  warnings: Ensure that the ResourceType enum values passed to this method are valid
    and supported by the ResourceManager instance. Invalid resource types may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect efficiency calculations.
