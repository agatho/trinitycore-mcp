  brief: Removes expired feral bleed effects from the tracker.
  description: The CleanupExpired method iterates through all active feral bleed effects
    stored in the FeralBleedTracker and removes those that have exceeded their duration
    or are no longer valid. This method is typically called during combat updates
    or at regular intervals to ensure that the tracker maintains accurate state information
    for active bleeds. It helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper game mechanics
    behavior by cleaning up stale effect data.

    code: "void Unit::UpdateCombat()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    feralBleedTracker.CleanupExpired();\n\
      \    // ... rest of combat logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    tracker accuracy. It's designed to be efficient and avoid performance bottlenecks
    by only processing effects that are past their expiration time.
