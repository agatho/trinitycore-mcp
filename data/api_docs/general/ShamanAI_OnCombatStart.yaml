  class: ShamanAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void ShamanAI::OnCombatStart(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes Shaman AI behavior when entering combat mode
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when a Shaman AI unit enters combat
    state. This method initializes the AI's combat behavior, sets up necessary combat
    variables, and prepares the shaman for engaging enemies. It typically handles
    the initial setup of spell casting priorities, target selection logic, and any
    combat-specific AI routines that should begin immediately upon entering combat.
    The method is part of the standard TrinityCore AI framework and is automatically
    called by the core when a shaman unit transitions from non-combat to combat state.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity that triggered the combat start. This
      parameter represents the initial enemy or threat source that caused the shaman
      to enter combat mode.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic OnCombatStart Usage
    code: "void ShamanAI::OnCombatStart(int* target)\n{\n    // Initialize combat\
      \ behavior\n    if (target && *target > 0)\n    {\n        // Set initial target\n\
      \        SetTarget(*target);\n        // Start combat spell casting\n      \
      \  CastSpell(SPELL_LIGHTNING_BOLT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the TrinityCore AI system automatically
    when a shaman enters combat. Developers should not manually invoke this method
    unless implementing custom AI behavior. The target parameter may be null or invalid
    if the combat was triggered by environmental factors rather than direct enemy
    engagement.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI framework as it may
    cause undefined behavior. Ensure that any custom implementation properly handles
    null targets and validates the target entity before using it in combat logic.
