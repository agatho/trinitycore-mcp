documentation:
  brief: Optimizes mana usage for the warlock AI by managing spell casting efficiency
    and resource allocation.
  description: The OptimizeManaManagement method is responsible for enhancing the
    efficiency of a warlock's mana usage within the AI system. It evaluates current
    mana levels, available spells, and combat conditions to determine optimal spell
    casting sequences that maximize damage output while minimizing mana expenditure.
    This method plays a crucial role in ensuring that the warlock AI maintains sustainable
    mana usage throughout extended battles, particularly when utilizing high-mana-cost
    abilities such as Soulfire or Rain of Fire. The implementation considers factors
    like spell cooldowns, target health, and the presence of beneficial buffs or debuffs
    to make intelligent decisions about when and which spells to cast.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    OptimizeManaManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the AI update cycle, preferably
    after checking for target validity and before spell selection. It assumes that
    the AI has access to current mana information and spell availability data. The
    optimization algorithm may vary based on the specific warlock specialization (Affliction,
    Demonology, Destruction) but generally focuses on balancing immediate damage with
    long-term sustainability.
  warnings: This method should not be called in isolation without proper context checks.
    Calling it when the warlock is out of mana or has no valid targets may lead to
    inefficient behavior. Additionally, frequent calls without sufficient cooldowns
    between executions could cause performance overhead in high-frequency AI update
    scenarios.
