  class: SocialManager
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float SocialManager::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the social manager
    component.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a floating-point value representing
    the approximate CPU utilization by the SocialManager class. This metric is typically
    used for performance monitoring and debugging purposes within the TrinityCore
    server environment. The returned value indicates how much processing power is
    being consumed by social-related operations such as chat handling, friend list
    management, and guild communications. The measurement may be averaged over a specific
    time interval or represent an instantaneous snapshot depending on internal implementation
    details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 100.0 representing the percentage of CPU
    usage by the social manager component. A value of 0.0 indicates no activity, while
    100.0 represents maximum possible CPU utilization for this component.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float cpuUsage = sSocialMgr->GetCPUUsage();

      printf("Current Social Manager CPU Usage: %.2f%%\n", cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Integration
    code: "void LogSocialManagerStats() {\n    float usage = sSocialMgr->GetCPUUsage();\n\
      \    if (usage > 80.0f) {\n        sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High\
      \ Social Manager CPU Usage: %.2f%%\", usage);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve system-level timing measurements and could have minimal
    performance overhead during execution. The accuracy of the returned value depends
    on the underlying platform's ability to measure CPU utilization for individual
    components. In multi-threaded environments, the reported usage might reflect aggregated
    activity across multiple threads.
  warnings: The returned value is an approximation and should not be used for critical
    decision-making processes. Frequent calls to this method may introduce slight
    overhead due to timing measurements. The value may fluctuate significantly in
    high-load scenarios and should be interpreted as a trend rather than an absolute
    measurement.
