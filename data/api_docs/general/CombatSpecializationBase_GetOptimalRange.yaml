  signature: float CombatSpecializationBase::GetOptimalRange(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal combat range for the current specialization
    based on the target unit.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    unit should engage in combat based on its current combat specialization. This
    value is typically used by AI systems to decide when to close or maintain distance
    from targets. The method evaluates the unit's current specialization and applies
    relevant game mechanics such as weapon range, spell range, or class-specific behaviors
    to compute an optimal engagement distance. It considers factors like the target's
    size, movement capabilities, and the unit's own combat abilities to determine
    this value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal combat range in yards. This
    value indicates the recommended distance at which the unit should engage its target
    for maximum effectiveness based on its current specialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float optimalRange = player->GetCombatSpecialization()->GetOptimalRange(targetUnit);\n\
      if (optimalRange > 0)\n{\n    // Use the optimal range for positioning logic\n\
      \    player->SetFacingToObject(targetUnit);\n    player->MoveTowards(targetUnit,\
      \ optimalRange - 1.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in AI decision-making processes and may be
    called frequently during combat scenarios. The returned value can vary based on
    the unit's current specialization, equipped weapons, and any active buffs or debuffs
    that modify range. For performance reasons, this calculation should not be done
    repeatedly without caching when possible.
  warnings: The method assumes a valid target unit is provided and may produce unexpected
    results if called with null or invalid targets. In rare cases, specializations
    might return zero or negative values which could indicate no optimal range exists
    for that particular combat specialization.
