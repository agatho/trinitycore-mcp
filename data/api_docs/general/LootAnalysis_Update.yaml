documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot analysis state based on the elapsed time since last update.
  description: The Update method in the LootAnalysis class is responsible for processing
    and maintaining the internal state of loot analysis data. It typically handles
    time-based operations such as updating timers, checking for expired loot entries,
    or performing periodic calculations related to loot distribution. This method
    is commonly called from the game loop with a delta time parameter to ensure that
    loot analysis logic remains synchronized with the overall game progression. The
    implementation may involve iterating through active loot items, recalculating
    probabilities, or notifying players of changes in loot availability.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'LootAnalysis* analysis = new LootAnalysis();

      uint32 diff = 1000; // 1 second elapsed

      analysis->Update(diff);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to maintain
    accurate loot state. It's recommended to pass the actual time difference (diff)
    between updates for precise timing behavior.
