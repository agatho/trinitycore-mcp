  class: RBACData
  method: RemovePermissions
  signature: void RBACData::RemovePermissions(RBACPermissionContainer & permsFrom,
    const RBACPermissionContainer & permsToRemove)
documentation:
  brief: Removes specified permissions from a permissions container by subtracting
    one container from another.
  description: The RemovePermissions method removes all permissions present in the
    permsToRemove container from the permsFrom container. This operation modifies
    the permsFrom container in-place, effectively filtering out any permissions that
    are also found in the permsToRemove container. The method is typically used in
    role-based access control (RBAC) systems to revoke specific permissions from a
    user or group's existing set of permissions. It ensures that only permissions
    not present in the removal set remain in the target container. This functionality
    is essential for dynamically adjusting user privileges within the TrinityCore
    framework, particularly when managing player roles and access rights.
  parameters:
  - name: permsFrom
    description: Reference to the RBACPermissionContainer from which permissions will
      be removed. This container is modified in-place to reflect the removal of specified
      permissions.
  - name: permsToRemove
    description: Const reference to the RBACPermissionContainer containing permissions
      that should be removed from permsFrom. These permissions are subtracted from
      the target container.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permission Removal
    code: 'RBACPermissionContainer userPerms;

      RBACPermissionContainer removePerms;


      // Add some initial permissions

      userPerms.insert(1); // Grant permission 1

      userPerms.insert(2); // Grant permission 2

      userPerms.insert(3); // Grant permission 3


      // Setup permissions to remove

      removePerms.insert(2); // Remove permission 2


      // Remove specified permissions

      RBACData::RemovePermissions(userPerms, removePerms);

      // userPerms now contains only permissions 1 and 3'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Multiple Permissions at Once
    code: 'RBACPermissionContainer playerPermissions;

      RBACPermissionContainer permissionsToRemove;


      // Player has multiple permissions

      playerPermissions.insert(10);

      playerPermissions.insert(15);

      playerPermissions.insert(20);

      playerPermissions.insert(25);


      // Remove several permissions at once

      permissionsToRemove.insert(15);

      permissionsToRemove.insert(25);


      // Perform removal

      RBACData::RemovePermissions(playerPermissions, permissionsToRemove);

      // playerPermissions now contains only permissions 10 and 20'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an in-place modification of the permsFrom container.
    The operation is efficient as it uses set difference logic internally. It's important
    to note that this method does not validate whether the permissions being removed
    actually exist in the target container - it simply removes them if they are present.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with large permission sets, as performance
    may degrade with many permissions. Also, ensure that the permsToRemove container
    is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
