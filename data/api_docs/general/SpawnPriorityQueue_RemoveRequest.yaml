  class: SpawnPriorityQueue
  method: RemoveRequest
  signature: bool SpawnPriorityQueue::RemoveRequest(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a spawn request with the specified GUID from the priority queue.
  description: The RemoveRequest method attempts to remove a spawn request identified
    by its unique identifier (GUID) from the SpawnPriorityQueue. This method is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to manage dynamic object spawning,
    such as creatures or game objects, ensuring that duplicate or unnecessary spawn
    requests are cleaned up. The operation returns true if the request was successfully
    removed, and false if no matching request exists in the queue. This functionality
    supports efficient resource management and prevents redundant spawning operations
    during server runtime.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the spawn request to be removed from
      the queue. This value must correspond to an existing entry in the priority queue,
      otherwise the method will return false.
  returns: Returns true if a spawn request with the specified GUID was found and successfully
    removed from the queue; returns false if no such request exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SpawnPriorityQueue queue;\n// Assume some request has been added previously\n\
      int guid = 12345;\nbool success = queue.RemoveRequest(guid);\nif (success) {\n\
      \    // Request was removed successfully\n} else {\n    // No request with this\
      \ GUID existed\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spawn Management Context
    code: "class CreatureSpawner {\npublic:\n    void CancelSpawn(int guid) {\n  \
      \      if (spawnQueue.RemoveRequest(guid)) {\n            // Log successful\
      \ removal\n            sLog->outString(\"Spawn request %d cancelled.\", guid);\n\
      \        } else {\n            // Log that no such request existed\n       \
      \     sLog->outString(\"No spawn request found for GUID %d.\", guid);\n    \
      \    }\n    }\nprivate:\n    SpawnPriorityQueue spawnQueue;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal data structure of SpawnPriorityQueue
    uses a hash map or similar fast lookup mechanism for GUIDs. It is recommended
    to call this method only when you are certain about the existence of a spawn request,
    as unnecessary calls may impact performance. The queue must be thread-safe if
    used in concurrent environments.
  warnings: Calling RemoveRequest with an invalid or non-existent GUID will not cause
    errors but will simply return false. Ensure that all GUIDs passed to this method
    are valid and previously added to the queue to avoid silent failures.
