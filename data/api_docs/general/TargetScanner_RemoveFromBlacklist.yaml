  class: TargetScanner
  method: RemoveFromBlacklist
  signature: void TargetScanner::RemoveFromBlacklist(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a target from the blacklist in the TargetScanner.
  description: The RemoveFromBlacklist method removes a specified target identified
    by its GUID from the internal blacklist used by the TargetScanner. This functionality
    is typically employed in AI behavior systems where certain targets should be temporarily
    or permanently excluded from consideration during target selection. The method
    ensures that the target can once again be considered for engagement or targeting
    by the scanning logic. It is commonly used in combat AI to manage enemy prioritization
    and avoid repeatedly targeting already defeated or irrelevant entities.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target to be removed from the
      blacklist. This value must correspond to a valid entity within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'TargetScanner scanner;

      scanner.RemoveFromBlacklist(12345); // Removes target with GUID 12345 from blacklist'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Combat AI Context
    code: "void OnTargetKilled(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target)\n    {\n        TargetScanner\
      \ scanner;\n        scanner.RemoveFromBlacklist(target->GetGUID());\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid target
    in the game world. If the GUID is not present in the blacklist, the operation
    will have no effect. The implementation likely uses a hash-based data structure
    for efficient lookup and removal.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and represents an
    actual entity in the game world. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead
    to undefined behavior or performance degradation if not handled properly by internal
    checks.
