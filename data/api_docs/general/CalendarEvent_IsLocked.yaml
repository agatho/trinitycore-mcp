  method: IsLocked
  signature: bool CalendarEvent::IsLocked() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the calendar event is locked and cannot be modified.
  description: The IsLocked method determines if a calendar event has been locked,
    preventing further modifications to its properties such as title, description,
    or time. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, calendar events can
    be locked by the event creator or guild leaders to maintain event integrity once
    an event is finalized. This method returns true if the event is locked and false
    otherwise. The lock status typically prevents players from editing event details,
    inviting new members, or changing event times after the event has been set.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the calendar event is locked and cannot be modified; returns
    false if the event is unlocked and can still be edited.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an event is locked before attempting to modify it
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event && !event->IsLocked())\
      \ {\n    // Safe to modify the event\n    event->SetTitle(\"Updated Event Title\"\
      );\n} else {\n    // Event is locked, cannot modify\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_EVENT_LOCKED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks an internal flag or state within the CalendarEvent
    class that indicates whether modifications are permitted. The locking mechanism
    is typically used in guild events where the organizer wants to prevent last-minute
    changes after the event has been announced.
