  signature: FormationType FormationManager::GetCurrentFormation() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current formation type of the FormationManager instance.
  description: The GetCurrentFormation method retrieves the active formation type
    currently assigned to the FormationManager. This method is typically used in the
    context of creature AI behavior, where formations define how units move and position
    themselves relative to each other. The returned FormationType enum indicates the
    specific formation strategy being applied, such as line, circle, or wedge. This
    method does not modify any internal state and is read-only in nature. It's commonly
    called during AI update cycles to determine the current tactical arrangement of
    a group of creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A FormationType enum value representing the current formation strategy
    being used by the FormationManager. Possible values may include LINE, CIRCLE,
    WEDGE, or other formation types defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "FormationType currentFormation = formationManager->GetCurrentFormation();\n\
      if (currentFormation == FORMATION_LINE)\n{\n    // Handle line formation logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads from internal state without modifying
    it. The FormationType enum values are defined in the TrinityCore source code and
    may vary depending on the specific implementation or patch version.
