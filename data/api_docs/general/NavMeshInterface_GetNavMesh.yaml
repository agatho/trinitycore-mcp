  method: GetNavMesh
  signature: const dtNavMesh * NavMeshInterface::GetNavMesh(Map * map) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the navigation mesh for the specified map.
  description: The GetNavMesh method retrieves a pointer to the Detour navigation
    mesh associated with a given Map object. This navigation mesh is used by the pathfinding
    system to compute valid paths for units moving through the game world. The returned
    pointer is const, indicating that the mesh should not be modified directly. The
    method ensures thread safety by using appropriate locking mechanisms internally
    when accessing the mesh data. It's commonly used in AI pathfinding logic and movement
    calculations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to the dtNavMesh object for the specified map, or nullptr
    if no navigation mesh is available for that map.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Pathfinding
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nconst dtNavMesh* navMesh = NavMeshInterface::GetNavMesh(map);\n\
      if (navMesh)\n{\n    // Use navMesh for pathfinding operations\n    // ... pathfinding\
      \ logic here ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Navigation Mesh Availability
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nconst dtNavMesh* navMesh = NavMeshInterface::GetNavMesh(map);\n\
      if (navMesh == nullptr)\n{\n    // Handle case where navigation mesh is not\
      \ available\n    // This might occur for maps without generated navmeshes\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"No navigation mesh found for map %u\", map->GetId());\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Proceed with navigation operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method internally manages access to the navigation mesh data structure,
    ensuring that concurrent access from multiple threads is handled safely. The returned
    dtNavMesh pointer should not be deleted or modified directly as it's managed by
    the NavMeshInterface. This method may return nullptr if the map has not been initialized
    with a navigation mesh or if the mesh generation failed.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the returned dtNavMesh object directly, as this
    can lead to undefined behavior and potential crashes. Ensure that the Map parameter
    is valid and loaded before calling this method, otherwise the result may be null.
