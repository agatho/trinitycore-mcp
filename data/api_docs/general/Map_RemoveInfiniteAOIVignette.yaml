api:
  class: Map
  method: RemoveInfiniteAOIVignette
  signature: void Map::RemoveInfiniteAOIVignette(Vignettes::VignetteData * vignette)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified infinite AoI vignette from the map.
  description: The RemoveInfiniteAOIVignette method removes a given vignette data
    object from the map's collection of infinite area of interest (AoI) vignettes.
    This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage
    dynamic world events or quest markers that are displayed to players within specific
    areas. The method ensures that the specified vignette is no longer rendered or
    processed by the map system, effectively removing it from the player's view. It
    is important to note that this operation modifies the internal state of the map
    and should be used carefully in scenarios involving active player interactions
    or event systems.
  parameters:
  - name: vignette
    description: Pointer to the Vignettes::VignetteData object that needs to be removed
      from the map. This parameter must not be null, as passing a null pointer could
      lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  returns: None. The method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of RemoveInfiniteAOIVignette
    code: 'Vignettes::VignetteData* myVignette = new Vignettes::VignetteData();

      // ... initialize vignette data ...

      map->RemoveInfiniteAOIVignette(myVignette);

      delete myVignette;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the map's internal vignette management system and
    should only be called when the vignette has been properly initialized. It is recommended
    to verify that the vignette exists in the map's collection before attempting removal
    to avoid potential errors.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method can result in undefined behavior
    or application crashes. Always ensure that the vignette object is valid and allocated
    before calling this function.
