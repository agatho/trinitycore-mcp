documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the game object clears its vignette upon opening.
  description: This method determines if a GameObjectTemplate should clear its associated
    vignette effect when the object is opened. In World of Warcraft's context, vignettes
    are visual effects that highlight interactive objects or quest markers. When this
    flag is set to true, the vignette will be removed from the player's UI upon interaction
    with the game object. This behavior is typically used for quest-related objects
    or interactive elements where the visual cue should disappear after being interacted
    with.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the GameObjectTemplate clears its vignette on opening, false otherwise.
    A return value of true indicates that the associated visual vignette effect will
    be removed when the object is interacted with, while false means the vignette
    remains visible.
  examples:
  - title: Check if GameObject Clears Vignette on Opening
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->ClearObjectVignetteonOpening())\n{\n    // This\
      \ object will clear its vignette when opened\n    sLog->outString(\"GameObject\
      \ %u clears vignette on opening.\", goTemplate->entry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest system logic and
    UI effects. The behavior may be influenced by other flags or conditions in the
    GameObject template, such as whether the object is a quest objective or has specific
    interaction requirements.
