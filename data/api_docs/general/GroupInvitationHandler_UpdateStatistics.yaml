  method: UpdateStatistics
  signature: void GroupInvitationHandler::UpdateStatistics(bool accepted, std::chrono::milliseconds
    responseTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates group invitation statistics with acceptance status and response time.
  description: The UpdateStatistics method records and accumulates data regarding
    group invitations, including whether the invitation was accepted and the time
    taken to respond. This method is typically invoked when a player accepts or declines
    a group invitation, allowing the system to track invitation success rates, response
    times, and overall group management effectiveness. The statistics collected can
    be used for performance analysis, player behavior insights, and game balance adjustments.
    This method does not directly affect gameplay mechanics but contributes to internal
    tracking and reporting systems.
  parameters:
  - name: accepted
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the group invitation was accepted
      (true) or declined (false).
  - name: responseTime
    description: The time interval in milliseconds between when the invitation was
      sent and when a response was received. This includes both acceptance and decline
      actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update statistics for an accepted invitation
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.UpdateStatistics(true, std::chrono::milliseconds(2500));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update statistics for a declined invitation with slow response
    code: 'GroupInvitationHandler handler;

      handler.UpdateStatistics(false, std::chrono::milliseconds(15000));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal counters and accumulators used for statistical
    analysis. It may be called from multiple threads during high-concurrency scenarios
    such as mass group invitations or raids. The responseTime parameter should be
    measured accurately to ensure meaningful statistics.
  warnings: Ensure that the responseTime is always a positive value to avoid skewing
    average response time calculations. Avoid calling this method with invalid or
    negative time values.
