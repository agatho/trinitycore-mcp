  signature: void DeathKnightAI::~DeathKnightAI()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a DeathKnightAI instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The DeathKnightAI destructor is automatically invoked when a DeathKnightAI
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, resets internal state variables,
    and performs necessary deinitialization tasks for the AI system. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a critical
    role in preventing memory leaks when AI-controlled Death Knights are removed from
    the game world or when their associated creatures are despawned. The method does
    not take any parameters and returns no value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of DeathKnightAI object
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    DeathKnightAI* ai = new DeathKnightAI(creature);\n\
      \    // ... use the AI ...\n    delete ai; // Destructor called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack allocation with automatic destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction(Creature* creature)\n{\n    DeathKnightAI ai(creature);\n\
      \    // AI object automatically destroyed when function exits\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called by the game engine's memory management
    system. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destruction process includes cleanup of
    internal data structures, potential removal from AI update queues, and notification
    of any subsystems that may be tracking this AI instance.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you have a specific need for
    manual object destruction. Calling it multiple times on the same object will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that all references to the DeathKnightAI object
    are removed before deletion to prevent dangling pointers.
