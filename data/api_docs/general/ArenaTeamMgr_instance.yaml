documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ArenaTeamMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ArenaTeamMgr
    class, providing global access to the arena team management system. This method
    ensures that only one instance of ArenaTeamMgr exists throughout the TrinityCore
    server lifecycle. The returned pointer can be used to access all arena team related
    functionality including creation, retrieval, and management of arena teams. This
    is a thread-safe implementation that guarantees consistent access to arena team
    data across different parts of the game server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single ArenaTeamMgr instance. The method never returns
    NULL as it's implemented as a singleton with proper initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Arena Team Manager
    code: "ArenaTeamMgr* arenaMgr = ArenaTeamMgr::instance();\nArenaTeam* team = arenaMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\n\
      if (team)\n{\n    // Use the arena team\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating and Managing Arena Teams
    code: "ArenaTeamMgr* mgr = ArenaTeamMgr::instance();\nArenaTeam* newTeam = mgr->CreateArenaTeam(\"\
      TestTeam\", 10, 15, 2);\nif (newTeam)\n{\n    // Add members to the team\n \
      \   newTeam->AddMember(player1);\n    newTeam->AddMember(player2);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton pattern conventions. The ArenaTeamMgr
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid throughout
    the server's runtime. All arena team operations should go through this singleton
    instance to ensure data consistency and proper synchronization.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, avoid creating multiple instances of ArenaTeamMgr.
    Directly calling this method in performance-critical sections should be avoided
    if possible, though it's generally safe as it's just returning a pointer to an
    already-created object.
