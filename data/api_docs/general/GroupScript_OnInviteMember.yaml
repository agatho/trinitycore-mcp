  signature: void GroupScript::OnInviteMember(Group * group, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a player is invited to join a group
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore scripting system whenever
    a player attempts to invite another player to join their group. It provides an
    opportunity for custom scripts to intercept and potentially modify the invitation
    process. The method receives the group object that initiated the invitation and
    the GUID of the invited player. This allows script developers to implement custom
    logic such as permission checks, cooldowns, or restrictions on who can be invited
    to groups.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group that is inviting
      a member
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player being invited to the group
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Invitation Handler
    code: "class MyGroupScript : public GroupScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyGroupScript()\
      \ : GroupScript(\"MyGroupScript\") {}\n\n    void OnInviteMember(Group* group,\
      \ uint32 guid) override\n    {\n        // Log the invitation\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Player with GUID %u was invited to group %u\", guid, group->GetId());\n    \
      \    \n        // Allow all invitations by default\n        // Custom logic\
      \ could be added here to deny certain invites\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Restrict Invitations Based on Player Level
    code: "class LevelRestrictedGroupScript : public GroupScript\n{\npublic:\n   \
      \ LevelRestrictedGroupScript() : GroupScript(\"LevelRestrictedGroupScript\"\
      ) {}\n\n    void OnInviteMember(Group* group, uint32 guid) override\n    {\n\
      \        // Get the invited player\n        Player* invitedPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(MAKE_NEW_GUID(guid,\
      \ 0, HIGHGUID_PLAYER));\n        \n        if (!invitedPlayer)\n           \
      \ return;\n        \n        // Prevent inviting players below level 10\n  \
      \      if (invitedPlayer->GetLevel() < 10)\n        {\n            group->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You cannot invite players below level 10.\");\n            // Note: This does\
      \ not actually cancel the invitation, it just logs and informs\n        }\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the group invitation process before the actual
    invitation is sent. It's important to note that modifying the group state directly
    within this function might not prevent the invitation from completing, as it's
    a notification rather than a control point for the invitation itself.
  warnings: Do not perform operations that could block or delay the game thread for
    extended periods, as this method is called synchronously during gameplay. Also,
    be cautious when accessing player data in this function, as the invited player
    may not yet be fully loaded into memory.
