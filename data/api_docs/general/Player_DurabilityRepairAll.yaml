documentation:
  brief: Repairs all durability items for the player with optional cost and discount.
  description: The DurabilityRepairAll method repairs all equipped items for a player,
    restoring their durability to maximum levels. It can optionally take a cost from
    the player's gold, apply a discount modifier, and use guild bank funds if specified.
    This method is commonly used during player interaction with NPCs or in game mechanics
    where players need to restore equipment without spending gold. The method handles
    all items in the player's inventory including equipped items, bags, and other
    gear.
  parameters:
  - name: takeCost
    description: If true, the method will deduct gold from the player's inventory
      for repair costs. If false, no gold is deducted.
  - name: discountMod
    description: A discount modifier applied to the repair cost, where 1.0 means no
      discount and values less than 1.0 indicate discounts.
  - name: guildBank
    description: If true, the method will use guild bank funds for repairs instead
      of player's gold. If false, player's gold is used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic durability repair
    code: player->DurabilityRepairAll(true, 1.0f, false);
    language: cpp
  - title: Discounted repair with guild bank
    code: player->DurabilityRepairAll(false, 0.5f, true);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during NPC interaction or when using repair
    services in-game. It processes all items in the player's inventory and may be
    used in conjunction with other methods like GetItemCount or GetGold to determine
    available funds.
  warnings: Be careful when using this method with guildBank=true, as it may cause
    issues if the guild bank doesn't have sufficient funds for repairs. Also, the
    discountMod parameter should be carefully handled to avoid unexpected gold deductions.
