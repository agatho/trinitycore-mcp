  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::RecordExperience(uint32_t botGuid, const Experience
    & exp)
documentation:
  brief: Records experience data for a bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The RecordExperience method is used to log or store experience-related
    data for a specific bot within the BehaviorAdaptation system. This method takes
    a bot's unique identifier (GUID) and an Experience object containing relevant
    experience metrics. It likely updates internal tracking mechanisms or persists
    data for adaptive AI behavior based on the recorded experience. The method does
    not return any value, indicating it performs a side-effect operation such as data
    storage or state update.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: A unique 32-bit identifier (GUID) that uniquely identifies the bot
      for which experience is being recorded. This value should correspond to a valid
      bot entity in the game world.
  - name: exp
    description: An Experience object containing the experience data to be recorded
      for the specified bot. This typically includes metrics such as experience gained,
      time spent, or other behavioral indicators used for AI adaptation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      Experience exp;

      exp.gained = 100;

      exp.timestamp = time(nullptr);

      behaviorAdaptation->RecordExperience(botGuid, exp);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI behavior adaptation system that
    adjusts bot performance or decision-making based on past experience. It may be
    called during events such as quest completion, combat encounters, or other gameplay
    activities where experience data is relevant.
