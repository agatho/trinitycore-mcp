documentation:
  brief: Updates the mage's armor spells based on current game state and spell availability.
  description: The UpdateArmorSpells method in the MageAI class is responsible for
    managing and updating the mage's armor-related spell states. This includes checking
    if the mage should apply or remove armor spells such as Ice Armor, Frost Armor,
    or Shadowform based on combat conditions, mana levels, and spell cooldowns. The
    method ensures that the mage maintains optimal defensive capabilities during different
    phases of gameplay, particularly in PvP scenarios where armor effectiveness can
    significantly impact survivability. It typically runs during AI update cycles
    to dynamically adjust spell usage according to evolving battlefield conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Cycle
    code: "void MageAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateArmorSpells();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the MageAI's main update loop.
    It may interact with the spell system to check for available spells, verify cooldowns,
    and determine optimal armor application timing. The implementation likely considers
    factors such as current threat level, target type (player vs NPC), and available
    mana resources.
  warnings: Care should be taken when modifying this method's behavior as it directly
    affects the mage's defensive capabilities. Incorrect implementation could lead
    to suboptimal spell usage or potential gameplay imbalance in PvP scenarios.
