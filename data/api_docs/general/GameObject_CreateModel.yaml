documentation:
  brief: Creates a model for the GameObject, initializing its visual representation
    in the game world.
  description: The CreateModel method initializes and sets up the visual model of
    a GameObject within the World of Warcraft environment. This method is responsible
    for establishing the graphical representation of the object, including its mesh,
    texture, and other visual components that are displayed to players in the game
    world. It typically involves setting up the object's display ID and ensuring proper
    synchronization between the server-side representation and client-side rendering.
    The method is commonly called during GameObject initialization or when the object's
    appearance needs to be updated.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObject Model Creation
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->CreateModel();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the initialization phase of a GameObject,
    and may be called multiple times depending on how often the visual representation
    needs to be updated. Performance considerations include the overhead of setting
    up mesh data and ensuring proper synchronization with client-side rendering.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to visual artifacts or display errors
    in the game world. The method should only be called when the GameObject's properties
    are properly initialized, as calling it before initialization may result in undefined
    behavior.
