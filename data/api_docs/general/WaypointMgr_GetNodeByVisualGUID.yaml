  method: GetNodeByVisualGUID
  signature: const WaypointNode * WaypointMgr::GetNodeByVisualGUID(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a waypoint node by its visual GUID from the waypoint manager.
  description: The GetNodeByVisualGUID method searches through the internal collection
    of waypoint nodes managed by the WaypointMgr class and returns a pointer to the
    node that matches the specified visual GUID. This method is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's AI and pathfinding systems where creatures or objects follow
    predefined waypoints. The returned pointer is const, indicating that the node
    should not be modified through this interface. If no matching node is found, the
    method returns a null pointer. This function is essential for retrieving specific
    waypoint data during NPC movement calculations and path validation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to the WaypointNode object if a matching visual GUID is
    found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no node exists with the specified GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const WaypointNode* node = waypointMgr->GetNodeByVisualGUID(12345);\nif\
      \ (node != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use the node for pathfinding or movement logic\n\
      \    printf(\"Found waypoint at: %f, %f\\n\", node->x, node->y);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the waypoint nodes. For performance-critical
    applications with many waypoints, consider caching results or using an optimized
    data structure for GUID lookups. The method is thread-safe if the underlying WaypointMgr
    instance is not modified concurrently.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before dereferencing the returned
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults. Since this returns a const pointer, attempting
    to modify the node through this interface will result in compilation errors.
