  class: PositionManager
  method: HasLineOfSight
  signature: bool PositionManager::HasLineOfSight(const int & from, const int & to)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether there is a clear line of sight between two positions in
    the game world.
  description: The HasLineOfSight method checks if a direct visual path exists between
    two specified positions within the game world, taking into account obstacles such
    as walls, terrain, and other solid objects. This functionality is crucial for
    determining whether units can see each other, which affects combat mechanics,
    spell casting, and AI behavior. The method performs a raycast from the 'from'
    position to the 'to' position and returns true if no blocking objects are encountered
    along the path. This check is commonly used in game logic to validate targeting,
    line-of-sight for spells, and NPC vision systems.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting position identifier or index from which the line of
      sight check begins. This typically represents a unit's location or a specific
      point in the world.
  - name: to
    description: The target position identifier or index to which the line of sight
      is checked. This typically represents another unit's location or a specific
      point in the world.
  returns: Returns true if there is an unobstructed line of sight between the 'from'
    and 'to' positions, indicating that no solid objects block the view. Returns false
    if any obstacle prevents direct visibility between the two points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Line of Sight Check
    code: "if (positionManager.HasLineOfSight(player1Guid, player2Guid)) {\n    //\
      \ Players can see each other\n    SendChatMessage(\"I can see you!\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Players cannot see each other due to obstruction\n    SendChatMessage(\"\
      You're hidden from me.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Spell Target Validation
    code: "if (positionManager.HasLineOfSight(casterGuid, targetGuid)) {\n    // Cast\
      \ spell successfully\n    CastSpellOnTarget(spellId, targetGuid);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Spell fails due to obstruction\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Your target\
      \ is blocked.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a raycast operation which may have performance implications
    when used frequently in tight loops. The implementation likely uses spatial partitioning
    or collision detection systems already present in the TrinityCore engine. It's
    important to note that this check is based on physical geometry and does not account
    for visual effects like invisibility or stealth that might affect perception.
  warnings: This method assumes that the provided position identifiers are valid and
    exist within the current world context. Using invalid identifiers may lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, line of sight checks do not consider
    dynamic environmental changes that occur during gameplay unless the underlying
    collision system is updated accordingly.
