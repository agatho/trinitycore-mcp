  class: BotPriorityCalculator
  method: GetProximityPriority
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityCalculator::GetProximityPriority(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the proximity priority value for a bot based on its
    distance to nearby players or targets.
  description: The GetProximityPriority method computes a numerical priority score
    for a given bot, determining how important it is for the bot to move toward or
    engage with nearby entities. This calculation typically considers factors such
    as distance to the nearest player or target, threat level, and potential combat
    relevance. The returned value is used by the AI system to prioritize which bots
    should take action first in proximity-based scenarios. This method is essential
    for managing bot behavior in group settings where positioning and targeting are
    crucial for effective gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or index
      within the system. The value should be a valid reference to a bot instance,
      typically obtained from internal bot management structures.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated proximity priority. Higher values
    indicate higher priority for movement or engagement actions. A return value of
    zero may signify that no relevant targets are in proximity or that the bot is
    not eligible for proximity-based priority calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 5;\nuint32 priority = calculator.GetProximityPriority(&botId);\n\
      if (priority > 0) {\n    // Bot has high proximity priority, take action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < botCount; ++i) {\n    uint32 priority = calculator.GetProximityPriority(&i);\n\
      \    if (priority > highestPriority) {\n        highestPriority = priority;\n\
      \        bestBotIndex = i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestBotIndex for next AI decision"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations and may involve caching
    or precomputed values to optimize performance in real-time scenarios. It is recommended
    that the bot parameter points to a valid, initialized bot object to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized bot pointer may result in incorrect
    priority calculation or runtime errors. Ensure that all bots are properly registered
    and managed before calling this method.
