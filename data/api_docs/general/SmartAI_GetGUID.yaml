documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the SmartAI object
  description: The GetGUID method returns the unique identifier associated with the
    SmartAI instance. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this GUID typically
    represents a specific game entity such as a creature, player, or game object that
    the SmartAI is attached to. The method provides access to the underlying identification
    mechanism used by the core game engine for tracking and referencing entities within
    the world. This identifier is crucial for performing operations that require referencing
    specific objects in the game world, such as targeting, interaction, or event handling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    SmartAI object. The GUID is typically a positive integer that uniquely identifies
    the entity within the game world. A return value of zero or negative values may
    indicate an invalid or uninitialized state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve entity GUID
    code: "void OnEnterCombat(Unit* target)\n{\n    int guid = this->GetGUID();\n\
      \    // Use the GUID for further processing\n    if (guid > 0)\n    {\n    \
      \    // Perform actions based on the entity's GUID\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Entity GUID: %d\", guid);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the SmartAI
    object's state. The returned GUID value should be treated as immutable and used
    primarily for identification purposes. In TrinityCore's architecture, GUIDs are
    managed by the core engine and are guaranteed to be unique within a given world
    instance.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID in operations that might require
    validation or conversion. Ensure proper error checking since invalid GUID values
    (zero or negative) may indicate an uninitialized or improperly configured SmartAI
    instance. Avoid storing raw GUIDs without proper context as they may become invalid
    if the entity is despawned.
