  class: SoloStrategy
  method: UpdateBehavior
  signature: void SoloStrategy::UpdateBehavior(BotAI * ai, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the behavior of a bot AI in solo strategy context.
  description: The UpdateBehavior method is responsible for managing and updating
    the artificial intelligence behavior of a bot when operating under solo strategy.
    This method is typically called during each game tick to ensure that the bot's
    actions remain consistent with the defined solo strategy rules. It processes the
    bot's current state, evaluates environmental conditions, and makes decisions based
    on predefined logic. The method operates within the TrinityCore framework and
    integrates with the broader AI system to control how individual bots behave in
    solo scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that represents the bot's artificial
      intelligence context. This parameter provides access to the bot's current state,
      memory, and decision-making capabilities.
  - name: diff
    description: Time difference in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based behaviors and ensure consistent timing
      across different system loads.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateBehavior Call
    code: "void UpdateBehavior(BotAI* ai, uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Implementation would\
      \ process bot AI logic here\n    if (ai && diff > 0)\n    {\n        // Process\
      \ solo strategy behavior\n        ai->UpdateSoloStrategy(diff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core game loop at regular intervals.
    Developers should ensure that the BotAI instance passed to this method is valid
    and properly initialized before calling. The diff parameter should be carefully
    handled to maintain consistent timing behavior across different performance conditions.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'ai' will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that all AI components are properly initialized before calling
    this method. The diff value should not be zero or negative, as it may cause incorrect
    time-based calculations.
