api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateAreaRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateAreaRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets all area requirements for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateAreaRequirements method checks if a given player has met
    all the area-based prerequisites required to accept or interact with a specific
    quest. This includes verifying that the player is in the correct zone, has visited
    required areas, and satisfies any location-specific conditions defined by the
    quest. The method typically integrates with the game's quest system to ensure
    logical progression and prevent players from accessing quests outside their intended
    scope. It returns true if all area requirements are satisfied, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate area requirements
      for. Must correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose area requirements
      are being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: True if all area requirements for the specified quest are met by the player;
    false otherwise. Returns false if the quest does not exist or if the player is
    not in a valid location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateAreaRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can proceed with quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(12345);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player cannot take the quest due to area restrictions\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You are not in the correct location for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "bool CanPlayerAcceptQuest(Player* player, uint32 questId) {\n    if (!player\
      \ || !sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(questId))\n        return false;\n    \n\
      \    // Validate area requirements before allowing quest acceptance\n    if\
      \ (QuestValidation::ValidateAreaRequirements(questId, player)) {\n        return\
      \ true;\n    }\n    \n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying quest template data and player's current
    zone/area information. It may perform database lookups or cached checks depending
    on how the system is implemented. The validation logic might include checking
    for specific zones, area triggers, or previous quest completions that affect area
    access.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid crashes. Also, be aware that if a quest has no area requirements defined
    in its template, this method may always return true regardless of player location.
