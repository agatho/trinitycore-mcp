  signature: void PlayerMenu::SendQuestGiverQuestListMessage(Object * questgiver)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a quest giver's quest list message to the player.
  description: The SendQuestGiverQuestListMessage method is responsible for displaying
    the available quests from a quest giver object (such as an NPC or GameObject)
    to the player's client. This method constructs and sends a packet containing the
    quest list data, including quest titles, levels, rewards, and other relevant information.
    It is typically invoked when a player interacts with a quest giver and initiates
    the quest interaction process. The method ensures that only quests relevant to
    the player's current progress are displayed, respecting quest gating and prerequisites.
  parameters:
  - name: questgiver
    description: Pointer to the Object representing the quest giver (NPC or GameObject)
      from which the quest list is being sent. Must be a valid object with quest data
      associated with it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when player interacts with an NPC
    code: "void Player::OnQuestGiverInteract(Object* questgiver)\n{\n    if (questgiver\
      \ && questgiver->IsCreature())\n    {\n        GetPlayerMenu()->SendQuestGiverQuestListMessage(questgiver);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest system and assumes that the quest
    giver object has valid quest data loaded. It internally handles filtering of quests
    based on player's level, completed quests, and quest prerequisites. The actual
    packet sending is handled by the core networking layer.
  warnings: Ensure that the questgiver parameter is not null and represents a valid
    object before calling this method. Calling with an invalid or uninitialized object
    may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors.
