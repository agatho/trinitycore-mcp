api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: HasDailyPattern
  signature: bool MarketAnalysis::HasDailyPattern(uint32 itemId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified item has a daily trading pattern in the market analysis
    system.
  description: The HasDailyPattern method determines whether a given item ID is associated
    with a daily trading pattern within the MarketAnalysis class. This functionality
    is typically used to identify items that exhibit predictable daily price fluctuations
    or trading behaviors, which can be useful for automated market monitoring, player
    advisory systems, or economic simulation tools. The method likely queries an internal
    database or cache of item patterns and returns true if a matching daily pattern
    exists for the specified item ID.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to check for daily trading pattern.
      Must be a valid item entry ID from the game's item database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified item has a defined daily trading pattern
    recorded in the market analysis system; otherwise returns false. This indicates
    whether the item's market behavior follows a predictable daily cycle that can
    be analyzed or predicted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (marketAnalysis.HasDailyPattern(12345)) {\n    // Item 12345 has a daily\
      \ pattern\n    printf(\"Item has daily trading pattern\\n\");\n} else {\n  \
      \  // No daily pattern found for item 12345\n    printf(\"Item does not have\
      \ daily trading pattern\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Market Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorDailyPatterns(MarketAnalysis& analysis) {\n    for (uint32\
      \ itemId = 1; itemId < MAX_ITEM_ID; ++itemId) {\n        if (analysis.HasDailyPattern(itemId))\
      \ {\n            // Process items with daily patterns\n            LogDailyPattern(itemId);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup operation in an internal data structure
    or database. For performance-critical applications, repeated calls to this method
    should be optimized by caching results or batching queries. The implementation
    may rely on precomputed market data that is updated periodically.
  warnings: Ensure the itemId parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual item
    in the game database; invalid IDs might cause undefined behavior or return false
    incorrectly. This method does not validate whether the item is actually tradable
    or available in the game world, only whether a pattern exists in the analysis
    system.
