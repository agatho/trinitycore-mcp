  class: ObstacleAvoidanceManager
  method: AssessObstaclePriority
  signature: ObstaclePriority ObstacleAvoidanceManager::AssessObstaclePriority(const
    ObstacleInfo & obstacle, const DetectionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the priority level of an obstacle based on detection
    context and obstacle properties.
  description: 'The AssessObstaclePriority method determines how significant or urgent
    an obstacle is for pathfinding and movement decisions within the TrinityCore AI
    system. It analyzes the provided obstacle information along with contextual data
    such as agent position, target destination, and environmental factors to assign
    a priority level. This priority influences which obstacles are considered first
    during avoidance calculations. The method is typically invoked by navigation systems
    or AI behaviors when evaluating potential hindrances to movement. Precondition:
    The input obstacle must be valid and contain meaningful data; the context should
    reflect current agent state and environment. Postcondition: A well-defined ObstaclePriority
    value is returned that can be used for decision-making in obstacle avoidance logic.'
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: A reference to an ObstacleInfo structure containing details about
      the specific obstacle being assessed, including its type, size, position, and
      other relevant properties.
  - name: context
    description: A DetectionContext object that provides contextual information such
      as agent's current location, target destination, movement direction, and environmental
      factors affecting obstacle relevance.
  returns: An ObstaclePriority enum value indicating the relative importance or urgency
    of the obstacle. Possible values may include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL depending
    on implementation details. Higher priority values indicate more immediate need
    for avoidance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Behavior
    code: "ObstacleInfo obs;\nDetectionContext ctx;\n// Populate obs and ctx with\
      \ relevant data\nObstaclePriority priority = manager.AssessObstaclePriority(obs,\
      \ ctx);\nif (priority >= ObstaclePriority::HIGH) {\n    // Initiate high-priority\
      \ avoidance behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Pathfinding System
    code: "std::vector<ObstacleInfo> obstacles = GetNearbyObstacles();\nDetectionContext\
      \ context = GetCurrentContext();\nstd::map<ObstacleInfo, ObstaclePriority> priorities;\n\
      for (const auto& obs : obstacles) {\n    priorities[obs] = manager.AssessObstaclePriority(obs,\
      \ context);\n}\n// Sort by priority to process most critical first\nstd::sort(obstacles.begin(),\
      \ obstacles.end(), [&priorities](const ObstacleInfo& a, const ObstacleInfo&\
      \ b) {\n    return priorities[a] > priorities[b];\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the dynamic obstacle avoidance system and may involve
    complex calculations involving spatial relationships, movement vectors, and agent-specific
    behaviors. Performance can be impacted by the number of obstacles being evaluated
    simultaneously. The exact algorithmic details are abstracted away but generally
    rely on distance metrics, angle thresholds, and velocity projections to determine
    priority.
  warnings: Ensure that both obstacle and context parameters are properly initialized
    before calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Do not assume
    fixed priority values across different versions of TrinityCore as these might
    change based on AI updates or configuration settings.
