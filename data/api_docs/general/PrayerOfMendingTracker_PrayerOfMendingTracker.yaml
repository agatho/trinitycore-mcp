  brief: Initializes a new instance of the PrayerOfMendingTracker class
  description: The PrayerOfMendingTracker constructor initializes the internal state
    of the tracker object. This method sets up the necessary data structures and default
    values required for tracking Prayer of Mending effects on targets. The tracker
    is responsible for managing the healing application and duration of the Prayer
    of Mending spell, which allows a healer to heal multiple targets over time. It
    ensures proper cleanup and initialization before the tracker can be used to monitor
    active Prayer of Mending effects.

  - title: Creating a new PrayerOfMendingTracker instance
    code: 'PrayerOfMendingTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track Prayer of Mending effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new tracker instance.
    The tracker maintains its own internal state and does not require external initialization
    after construction. It's typically used internally by the spell system when a
    Prayer of Mending effect is applied to a target.
