  class: MonkAI
  method: RecordAbilityUsage
  signature: void MonkAI::RecordAbilityUsage(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Records the usage of a specified monk ability by storing its spell ID for
    tracking and analysis.
  description: The RecordAbilityUsage method is used within the MonkAI class to log
    when a specific monk ability (identified by its spell ID) has been utilized. This
    functionality supports game mechanics such as cooldown tracking, ability rotation
    optimization, and performance analytics for monk characters in World of Warcraft.
    The method does not return any value but updates internal state or logs that can
    be accessed later for decision-making or reporting purposes. It is typically invoked
    during the execution of an ability to ensure accurate tracking of usage patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific monk spell or ability
      being used. This value must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's
      database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void SomeMonkAI::UseHealingAbility()\n{\n    int healingSpellId = 12345;\n\
      \    RecordAbilityUsage(healingSpellId);\n    // Perform the actual healing\
      \ logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Recording
    code: "void MonkAI::ExecuteNextAbility()\n{\n    if (HasAvailableAbility())\n\
      \    {\n        int currentSpellId = GetCurrentSpellId();\n        RecordAbilityUsage(currentSpellId);\n\
      \        CastSpell(currentSpellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system for monks and may be used in conjunction
    with other tracking mechanisms like cooldown timers or resource management. The
    internal storage mechanism for recorded abilities should be considered when implementing
    large-scale logging or performance-sensitive code.
