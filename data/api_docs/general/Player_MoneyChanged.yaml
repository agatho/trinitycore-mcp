  brief: Updates player's money amount when it changes
  description: The MoneyChanged method is used to notify the game system that a player's
    money has been modified. This method typically gets called when a player's gold
    amount is altered through various in-game actions such as looting, selling items,
    or receiving quest rewards. It ensures that the player's money is properly updated
    and that any relevant UI updates occur accordingly. The method handles internal
    tracking of money changes and may trigger related events or notifications within
    the game engine.

    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint64 newMoney = 10000;

      player->MoneyChanged(newMoney);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game engine when money
    changes occur, and developers should not call it directly unless necessary. It
    may trigger updates to player's UI display and related game events.
