  signature: double SystemMemoryAnalytics::CalculateMemoryPressure() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current system memory pressure level as a double
    value.
  description: The CalculateMemoryPressure method computes the system's current memory
    pressure by analyzing various memory metrics such as available physical memory,
    used memory, and system thresholds. This value represents how heavily the system
    is utilizing its memory resources, typically expressed as a ratio or percentage
    between 0.0 (low pressure) and 1.0 (high pressure). The method is designed to
    help TrinityCore systems make informed decisions about resource allocation, garbage
    collection, and performance optimization. It may be used internally by the core
    to determine when to trigger memory cleanup routines or adjust server load balancing
    strategies.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the system memory pressure level, typically
    ranging from 0.0 (indicating low memory pressure) to 1.0 (indicating high memory
    pressure). Values closer to 1.0 suggest that the system is under significant memory
    stress and may require immediate attention or optimization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SystemMemoryAnalytics analytics;\nconst double pressure = analytics.CalculateMemoryPressure();\n\
      if (pressure > 0.8)\n{\n    // Trigger memory cleanup or logging\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      High memory pressure detected: %.2f\", pressure);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs system-level calls to retrieve memory statistics,
    which might have performance implications if called too frequently. It is recommended
    to cache the result or call it at appropriate intervals rather than on every game
    tick. The implementation may vary depending on the operating system and platform.
  warnings: Calling this method in a high-frequency loop can cause performance degradation
    due to system calls required for memory statistics retrieval. Avoid using it in
    time-critical sections of code where low latency is essential.
