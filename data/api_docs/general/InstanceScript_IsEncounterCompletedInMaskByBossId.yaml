  signature: bool InstanceScript::IsEncounterCompletedInMaskByBossId(uint32 completedEncountersMask,
    uint32 bossId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific boss encounter has been completed within a given mask
    of completed encounters.
  description: 'The IsEncounterCompletedInMaskByBossId method determines whether a
    particular boss encounter, identified by its unique boss ID, has been marked as
    completed within a bitmask representing all completed encounters in an instance.
    This utility function is commonly used during instance scripting to evaluate the
    completion status of specific encounters without needing to iterate through all
    encounters manually. The method takes two parameters: a mask of completed encounters
    and the boss ID of the encounter to check. It returns true if the specified boss
    encounter is marked as completed in the provided mask, false otherwise. This functionality
    supports dynamic encounter state management within TrinityCore''s instance scripting
    framework.'
  parameters:
  - name: completedEncountersMask
    description: A bitmask representing all completed encounters in the instance.
      Each bit corresponds to a specific boss encounter, with set bits indicating
      completed encounters.
  - name: bossId
    description: The unique identifier of the boss encounter to check for completion
      status within the provided mask.
  returns: Returns true if the specified boss encounter (identified by bossId) is
    marked as completed in the completedEncountersMask; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific boss encounter is completed
    code: "if (instance->IsEncounterCompletedInMaskByBossId(0x0F, BOSS_MARWYN))\n\
      {\n    // Marwyn encounter has been completed\n    // Proceed with logic for\
      \ completed encounter\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in conditional instance logic
    code: "uint32 completedMask = instance->GetCompletedEncounters();\nif (instance->IsEncounterCompletedInMaskByBossId(completedMask,\
      \ BOSS_SINDRAGOSA))\n{\n    // Sindragosa encounter already completed\n    //\
      \ Skip or modify behavior accordingly\n    return false;\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with normal encounter logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with encounter completion tracking
    systems within TrinityCore's instance scripting. The bossId parameter should correspond
    to a valid encounter ID defined in the instance's encounter data. Bitmask operations
    are efficient, but developers must ensure that the mask and bossId values align
    correctly with the expected bit positions for accurate results.
  warnings: Ensure that the completedEncountersMask is properly synchronized with
    the actual encounter completion state of the instance to avoid incorrect results.
    Misalignment between the mask and boss IDs may lead to false positives or negatives
    when checking encounter status.
