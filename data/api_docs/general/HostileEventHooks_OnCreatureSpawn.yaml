documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a creature is spawned in the world
  description: The OnCreatureSpawn method is invoked whenever a creature object is
    successfully created and added to the game world. This hook allows custom AI logic,
    event triggers, or modifications to be executed at the moment of creature instantiation.
    It serves as a key integration point for extending or altering creature behavior
    during their initial spawn phase. The method receives a pointer to an integer
    representing the creature's unique identifier (GUID) and is typically used in
    conjunction with other hostile event hooks to manage dynamic encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to an integer containing the unique identifier (GUID) of
      the spawned creature. This value can be used to retrieve or manipulate the creature
      object through TrinityCore's core APIs.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Creature Spawn Hook Implementation
    code: "void HostileEventHooks::OnCreatureSpawn(int* creature)\n{\n    if (creature\
      \ == nullptr) return;\n    // Log the spawn event\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature\
      \ with GUID %u has spawned.\", *creature);\n    // Perform custom logic here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Creature Data Retrieval
    code: "void HostileEventHooks::OnCreatureSpawn(int* creature)\n{\n    if (creature\
      \ == nullptr) return;\n    \n    Creature* cr = sObjectAccessor->GetCreature(*creature);\n\
      \    if (!cr) return;\n    \n    // Modify creature properties on spawn\n  \
      \  cr->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n    cr->AddLootMode(LOOT_MODE_DEFAULT);\n\
      \    \n    // Trigger custom AI behavior\n    cr->AI()->OnCreatureSpawn();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the creature's initialization phase, before
    it enters combat or begins normal gameplay operations. Ensure that any modifications
    made to the creature do not interfere with core game mechanics or cause performance
    bottlenecks. The parameter 'creature' points to a GUID value which should be dereferenced
    carefully to avoid null pointer exceptions.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the creature object directly without proper locking
    mechanisms, as this may lead to race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
    Avoid performing heavy computations or database operations within this hook to
    prevent freezing the game loop.
