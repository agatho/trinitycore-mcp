  signature: bool Unit::IsMounted() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is currently mounted.
  description: This method determines whether a Unit object (such as a player or creature)
    is currently mounted on a vehicle or beast of burden. It returns true if the unit
    has a valid mount and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in game logic
    to prevent certain actions while mounted, or to trigger specific behaviors when
    a unit is not mounted. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper
    game state and player experience during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is mounted, false otherwise. The return value
    indicates whether the unit has an active mount in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsMounted()) {\n    // Do something when player is mounted\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Do something when player is not mounted\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal game state tracking and may be affected by
    the unit's current mount status. Performance considerations are minimal as it
    simply checks a flag or state variable.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    movement-related functions, as mounting can affect movement speed and behavior
    in various ways.
