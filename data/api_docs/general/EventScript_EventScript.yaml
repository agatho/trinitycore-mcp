  class: EventScript
  method: EventScript
  signature: void EventScript::EventScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes an EventScript with the specified name for event handling in
    TrinityCore.
  description: The EventScript constructor initializes a new event script instance
    with the given name. This method sets up the internal state required for managing
    game events within the TrinityCore framework. The script name is used to identify
    and register the event handler with the core event system. This initialization
    typically occurs during server startup or when dynamically loading scripts at
    runtime. The method does not return any value but prepares the object for subsequent
    event processing operations.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string representing the unique identifier/name
      of the event script. This name is used internally by TrinityCore to register
      and dispatch events. Must be a valid, non-null string with no special characters
      that could interfere with internal processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic EventScript Initialization
    code: EventScript myEvent("PlayerLoginEvent");
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Script Registration
    code: 'const char* scriptName = "CreatureSpawnEvent";

      EventScript* newScript = new EventScript(scriptName);

      // Script is now registered with the event system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during object instantiation. The name
    parameter must be a valid C-string and cannot be null. Event scripts initialized
    this way will automatically register themselves with the TrinityCore event manager
    upon construction.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on already-registered scripts as
    it may cause conflicts in the event handling system. Ensure that script names
    are unique to prevent overwriting existing event handlers.
