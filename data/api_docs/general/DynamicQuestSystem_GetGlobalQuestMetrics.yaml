  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: GetGlobalQuestMetrics
  signature: QuestMetrics DynamicQuestSystem::GetGlobalQuestMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves global quest metrics for the dynamic quest system.
  description: The GetGlobalQuestMetrics method returns a QuestMetrics object containing
    aggregated statistics and performance data for all active quests within the dynamic
    quest system. This includes information such as total completed quests, active
    quest count, average completion time, and other relevant metrics that help monitor
    the health and usage of the quest system. The returned data is typically used
    for administrative purposes, performance monitoring, or in-game analytics to understand
    player engagement with dynamic quests.
  parameters: []
  returns: A QuestMetrics object containing global statistics about quest completion,
    active quests, and related performance indicators. This structure usually includes
    fields like total completed quests, currently active quests, average time to complete,
    and other system-wide metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'QuestMetrics metrics = sDynamicQuestSystem->GetGlobalQuestMetrics();

      uint32 completed = metrics.GetTotalCompleted();

      uint32 active = metrics.GetActiveQuestCount();

      printf("Completed: %u, Active: %u\n", completed, active);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive if the quest system has a large
    number of active quests. It's recommended to cache results or call it at appropriate
    intervals rather than on every tick. The returned metrics are typically updated
    periodically and may not reflect real-time changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the DynamicQuestSystem singleton is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as accessing it before initialization may result in undefined
    behavior or null pointer exceptions. This method should not be called from within
    a quest event handler to avoid potential deadlocks.
