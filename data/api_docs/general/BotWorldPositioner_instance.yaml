documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotWorldPositioner class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotWorldPositioner
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access the global bot world positioning
    manager that handles coordinate transformations, spatial queries, and position-related
    operations for AI-controlled bots in the game world. The returned pointer should
    be used carefully as it represents a shared resource that may be accessed concurrently
    by multiple threads.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotWorldPositioner instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton is guaranteed to be initialized during application startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the BotWorldPositioner singleton
    code: "BotWorldPositioner* positioner = BotWorldPositioner::instance();\nif (positioner)\n\
      {\n    // Use the positioner for bot positioning operations\n    positioner->SomePositioningFunction();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows standard singleton implementation patterns. The BotWorldPositioner
    instance is typically initialized during TrinityCore's startup phase and remains
    valid for the duration of the application. Developers should be aware that this
    is a global shared resource, so any modifications to its state may affect all
    bots in the system.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton pattern implementation, calling this method
    multiple times will always return the same instance pointer. Avoid storing references
    to the returned pointer beyond the scope where it's guaranteed to be valid. The
    singleton instance should not be manually deleted or destroyed by client code.
