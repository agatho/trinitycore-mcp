  class: DemonHunterAI
  method: HandleResourceGeneration
  signature: void DemonHunterAI::HandleResourceGeneration(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Generates and manages resource accumulation for Demon Hunter class AI behavior.
  description: The HandleResourceGeneration method is responsible for managing the
    accumulation of Demon Hunter's resource system, typically involving Fury or Pain
    generation based on combat actions. This method likely updates internal resource
    counters, triggers resource-based ability activations, and ensures proper resource
    management during AI-controlled Demon Hunter gameplay. It operates within the
    context of TrinityCore's AI framework and integrates with the Demon Hunter's unique
    resource mechanics that differ from other classes.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target resource value or state
      indicator. This parameter likely controls how resource generation is calculated
      or applied, potentially indicating whether to generate resources for attack,
      defense, or special abilities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Generation Call
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    int target = 10;\n   \
      \ HandleResourceGeneration(&target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Generation with Conditional Logic
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::DoCombatAction() {\n    int target = 0;\n    if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30) {\n        target = 25; // Generate more resources when low on health\n\
      \    } else {\n        target = 15; // Normal resource generation\n    }\n \
      \   HandleResourceGeneration(&target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Demon Hunter AI system and should be called regularly
    during combat updates. The target parameter likely influences how much resource
    is generated, with different values triggering different resource behaviors or
    thresholds.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. This method may directly modify internal
    AI state variables related to resource tracking.
