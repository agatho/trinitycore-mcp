  signature: void ThreatManager::ClearAllThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all threat entries from the ThreatManager's threat list.
  description: The ClearAllThreat method clears the entire threat list managed by
    the ThreatManager, removing all current threat values for units within its scope.
    This function is typically used during creature AI behavior changes, such as when
    a mob switches targets or when resetting the threat table after combat ends. The
    operation effectively resets the threat state for all entities that were previously
    on the aggro list, allowing new threat calculations to begin fresh. No parameters
    are required as the method operates on the internal threat list of the ThreatManager
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing threat after combat
    code: "void CreatureAI::JustDied()\n{\n    // Clear all threat when creature dies\n\
      \    me->GetThreatManager().ClearAllThreat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting threat during AI state change
    code: "void CreatureAI::EnterCombat(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Reset threat before\
      \ entering combat\n    me->GetThreatManager().ClearAllThreat();\n    // Add\
      \ initial threat for the new target\n    me->GetThreatManager().AddThreat(target,\
      \ 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method invalidates all current threat values and should be used carefully
    during active combat scenarios. It's recommended to call this method before applying
    new threat calculations to avoid conflicts with existing entries.
  warnings: Calling ClearAllThreat during active combat may cause unexpected behavior
    if not followed by proper threat re-calculation. Ensure that threat is properly
    re-established after clearing to maintain proper AI targeting behavior.
