  signature: bool Creature::IsMovementPreventedByCasting() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether creature movement is prevented by casting.
  description: This method checks if a creature's movement is currently restricted
    due to ongoing casting activities. It returns true when the creature is in the
    middle of casting a spell and cannot move, false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper game mechanics during spellcasting sequences,
    particularly for creatures that may need to remain stationary while performing
    actions. The method typically applies to creatures with specific AI behavior or
    those that are actively engaged in casting operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature's movement is prevented by casting activity,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether the creature is currently in a state where
    movement is restricted due to spellcasting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (creature->IsMovementPreventedByCasting()) {\n    // Do something\n\
      }\nelse {\n    // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely checks internal state
    flags related to casting or movement restrictions. Performance considerations
    include potential overhead from checking multiple conditions during movement updates.
    Thread safety is not an issue as this method is typically called within single-threaded
    contexts.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods, as it may interfere with normal creature AI behavior. Misuse could lead
    to creatures being stuck in place when they should be able to move.
