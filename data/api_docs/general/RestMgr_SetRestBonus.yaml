  class: RestMgr
  method: SetRestBonus
  signature: void RestMgr::SetRestBonus(RestTypes restType, float restBonus)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the rest bonus value for a specified rest type in the RestMgr system.
  description: The SetRestBonus method configures the bonus multiplier applied to
    rest-related benefits for a given rest type. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to manage player recovery mechanics, such as experience
    gains or resource regeneration during resting periods. The restType parameter
    defines which category of rest this bonus applies to, while restBonus specifies
    the multiplier value that will be applied. This method likely updates internal
    state within the RestMgr class and may affect how players' rest benefits are calculated
    in-game.
  parameters:
  - name: restType
    description: The type of rest to configure the bonus for. This is typically an
      enum value representing different rest states such as 'RestTypeNormal', 'RestTypeDeep',
      or 'RestTypeLunar' depending on the implementation.
  - name: restBonus
    description: The bonus multiplier to apply to rest benefits for the specified
      rest type. A value of 1.0 represents no bonus, while values greater than 1.0
      increase the benefit, and values less than 1.0 decrease it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Normal Rest Bonus
    code: RestMgr::SetRestBonus(RestTypes::REST_TYPE_NORMAL, 1.5f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Deep Rest Bonus
    code: RestMgr::SetRestBonus(RestTypes::REST_TYPE_DEEP, 0.0f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal data structures within the RestMgr class
    and may trigger updates to player state or UI elements that display rest bonuses.
    It should be called before any rest-related calculations are performed to ensure
    correct behavior.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting restBonus values (e.g., negative values) may cause
    unexpected gameplay behavior or crashes. Ensure that restType is a valid enum
    value supported by the RestMgr implementation.
