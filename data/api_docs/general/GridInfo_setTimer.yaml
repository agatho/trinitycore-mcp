  class: GridInfo
  method: setTimer
  signature: void GridInfo::setTimer(const int & pTimer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the timer value for the grid information object.
  description: The setTimer method assigns a new timer value to the GridInfo object,
    which is typically used to track time-based events or updates within a specific
    grid area. This method allows external systems to control or modify the internal
    timer state of the grid, enabling dynamic behavior based on game logic or event
    triggers. The timer value is usually expressed in milliseconds and may be used
    for various purposes such as respawn timers, quest progress tracking, or NPC behavior
    scheduling.
  parameters:
  - name: pTimer
    description: The new timer value to set for the grid information object. This
      value represents time in milliseconds and should be a non-negative integer.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Grid Timer
    code: 'GridInfo* gridInfo = new GridInfo();

      gridInfo->setTimer(30000); // Set timer to 30 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Grid Timer Based on Game Event
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest* quest)\n{\n    GridInfo* grid\
      \ = GetGridForPlayer(player);\n    grid->setTimer(60000); // Extend timer to\
      \ 1 minute after quest completion\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GridInfo class is typically used within the TrinityCore server's grid
    system to manage objects and events within specific areas of the game world. This
    method directly modifies an internal state variable, so care should be taken when
    modifying timers during active gameplay to avoid unexpected behavior or race conditions.
  warnings: Modifying grid timers while other systems are actively using them may
    cause inconsistencies in event timing or object management. Ensure that timer
    changes are synchronized with the game loop or use appropriate locking mechanisms
    if accessed from multiple threads.
