  class: FollowerAI
  method: StartFollow
  signature: void FollowerAI::StartFollow(int * player, int factionForFollower, int
    quest)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the follower AI behavior for a creature to follow a player, with
    optional faction and quest assignment.
  description: The StartFollow method initializes the follower AI system for a creature,
    instructing it to begin following a specified player. This method is typically
    used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore to manage NPC followers, such as those that
    accompany players during quests or events. The method sets up internal state tracking
    for the follower's behavior, including faction assignment and quest-related actions.
    It does not immediately cause the creature to move but rather prepares the AI
    system to respond to movement commands and quest events. The player parameter
    is expected to be a pointer to a valid Player object, while factionForFollower
    and quest parameters define the faction the follower should adopt and the quest
    they are associated with, respectively.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that this creature will follow. Must
      be a valid player instance or null.
  - name: factionForFollower
    description: The faction ID that the follower should assume. This determines how
      the creature interacts with other NPCs and players based on faction relations.
  - name: quest
    description: The quest ID associated with this follower. Used to track quest progress
      and determine when the follower should stop following or perform specific actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of StartFollow
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    if (Creature*\
      \ follower = GetCreature()->ToCreature())\n    {\n        follower->GetAI()->StartFollow(player,\
      \ 14, 12345);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using StartFollow with dynamic faction and quest
    code: "void SetFollowerForPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 factionId = player->GetTeam()\
      \ == ALLIANCE ? 14 : 15;\n    uint32 questId = GetQuestIdForPlayer(player);\n\
      \    if (Creature* follower = GetCreature()->ToCreature())\n    {\n        follower->GetAI()->StartFollow(player,\
      \ factionId, questId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the FollowerAI system and should only be called on
    creatures that have been properly initialized with a FollowerAI instance. The
    player parameter must not be null for proper functionality. The faction ID and
    quest ID parameters are used to set up appropriate AI behavior, but they do not
    automatically change the creature's appearance or name; these must be handled
    separately through other systems.
  warnings: Calling StartFollow without ensuring that the creature has a valid FollowerAI
    instance will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, passing null for the
    player parameter may cause issues with movement and quest tracking logic. The
    method does not perform any validation on faction or quest IDs, so invalid values
    may lead to unexpected AI behavior.
