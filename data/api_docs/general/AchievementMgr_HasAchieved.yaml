documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player has earned a specific achievement.
  description: The HasAchieved method determines if a player has already completed
    and earned a particular achievement within the game. This method is typically
    used to verify achievement status before granting rewards, displaying achievement
    information, or checking progress in quest or activity systems. The method performs
    a lookup in the player's achievement data store and returns true if the specified
    achievement ID exists in their completed achievements list, false otherwise. It
    does not modify any data but only reads from the player's achievement records.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has earned the specified achievement, false
    if they have not yet achieved it or if the achievement ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Achievement Check
    code: "if (player->GetAchievementMgr()->HasAchieved(1234)) {\n    // Player has\
      \ earned achievement ID 1234\n    player->SendNotification(\"You have already\
      \ completed this achievement!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Reward Granting
    code: "uint32 requiredAchievement = 5678;\nif (!player->GetAchievementMgr()->HasAchieved(requiredAchievement))\
      \ {\n    player->SendNotification(\"You must complete the prerequisite achievement\
      \ first.\");\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with granting reward since prerequisite\
      \ is met"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on cached achievement data and assumes that the player's
    achievement state is up-to-date. It should be used in contexts where achievement
    status needs to be checked without modifying the player's data. The method may
    involve database lookups or memory-based checks depending on how achievements
    are stored internally.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths
    as it might trigger database queries if achievement data is not fully cached.
    Also, ensure that the achievement ID passed is valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
