  signature: void AreaTriggerAI::OnInitialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the AreaTriggerAI instance and sets up internal state for area
    trigger behavior.
  description: The OnInitialize method is called during the construction or activation
    of an AreaTriggerAI instance. It performs necessary setup operations such as initializing
    member variables, registering event handlers, and preparing the AI for its intended
    functionality within the game world. This method ensures that all required resources
    are allocated and configured before the area trigger begins executing its behavior
    logic. The initialization process typically occurs once when the area trigger
    is first created or enabled in the game environment.

  examples:
  - title: Basic AreaTriggerAI Initialization
    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    void OnInitialize()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Custom initialization logic here\n        AreaTriggerAI::OnInitialize();\n\
      \        // Additional setup code\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    during area trigger creation. Developers should avoid calling this method directly
    unless implementing a custom AI class that requires specific initialization behavior.
