  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: MoveToAssistPosition
  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::MoveToAssistPosition(Player * bot, Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Moves the bot to an assist position relative to the target unit.
  description: The MoveToAssistPosition method calculates and executes a movement
    path for the specified bot player to reach a position that allows it to assist
    the given target unit. This typically involves positioning the bot within melee
    range or a designated assist range of the target, considering factors such as
    terrain, obstacles, and combat mechanics. The method returns true if the movement
    was successfully initiated or completed, and false if the movement failed due
    to invalid parameters, pathfinding issues, or other constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will move.
      Must be a valid player instance; null pointer will result in failure.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the bot is assisting. This can be
      any unit type (player, creature, etc.). Must be a valid unit instance; null
      pointer will result in failure.
  returns: Returns true if the bot successfully started or completed movement to the
    assist position, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid inputs, pathfinding
    failures, or inability to reach the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of MoveToAssistPosition
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player instance\nUnit* target = ...;\
      \ // Assume valid unit instance\nif (TargetAssistAction::MoveToAssistPosition(bot,\
      \ target)) {\n    // Movement succeeded\n} else {\n    // Movement failed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI logic for bots that need to position
    themselves to assist allies or targets during combat. It may involve pathfinding
    calculations and could be blocking depending on implementation details. The bot's
    current state (e.g., if it's already moving) should be considered before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Ensure both 'bot' and 'target' parameters are valid non-null pointers
    to avoid undefined behavior. Calling this method while the bot is in an invalid
    state (e.g., dead or in a taxi flight) may lead to unexpected results or errors.
