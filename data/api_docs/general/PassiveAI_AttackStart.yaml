  class: PassiveAI
  method: AttackStart
  signature: void PassiveAI::AttackStart(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates attack behavior for a passive AI unit against a specified target.
  description: The AttackStart method in PassiveAI is responsible for triggering the
    attack behavior of a creature that uses passive AI. This method is typically invoked
    when the AI unit detects or is commanded to engage a target. In the context of
    TrinityCore, PassiveAI units are generally non-aggressive and do not automatically
    attack unless explicitly triggered. The method handles the transition from idle
    state to combat state for the unit, setting up necessary flags and initiating
    the attack sequence. It may also update the AI's current target and prepare the
    creature for melee or ranged attacks depending on its configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target entity ID or index.
      This parameter determines which unit the passive AI will attack. The value is
      typically a GUID or internal index used by the TrinityCore core to identify
      the target.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AttackStart Usage
    code: "void MyPassiveAI::OnTargetSelected(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (target)\n\
      \    {\n        int targetId = target->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        AttackStart(&targetId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The PassiveAI class is designed for creatures that do not automatically engage
    in combat. The AttackStart method must be explicitly called to initiate an attack
    sequence. It's important to ensure the target entity exists and is valid before
    calling this method, as invalid targets may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Calling AttackStart with a null or invalid pointer can cause memory access
    violations or unexpected AI behavior. Always validate that param0 points to a
    valid target before invoking this method. Additionally, since PassiveAI units
    are typically non-aggressive, using this method may override their default passive
    behavior and should be used carefully in scripted scenarios.
