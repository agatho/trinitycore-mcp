    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the result of a gathering action performed on a gathering node
  description: The HandleGatheringResult method is responsible for managing the outcome
    of a player's gathering attempt on a specific gathering node. It evaluates whether
    the gathering was successful and triggers appropriate game mechanics such as awarding
    resources, updating the node state, or notifying the player of failure. This method
    typically follows a gathering request and handles the logical consequences of
    that action within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: node
    description: Reference to the GatheringNode object representing the resource node
      that was gathered. Contains information about the node type, current state,
      and available resources.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the gathering action succeeded (true)
      or failed (false). Determines subsequent game logic flow.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleGatheringResult
    code: 'GatheringManager manager;

      GatheringNode node;

      // Assume node is initialized with valid data

      manager.HandleGatheringResult(node, true); // Process successful gathering'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling failed gathering result
    code: 'GatheringManager manager;

      GatheringNode node;

      // Assume node is initialized with valid data

      manager.HandleGatheringResult(node, false); // Process failed gathering'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's inventory system and may update
    the node's cooldown or depletion state. It should be called after a gathering
    action has been processed but before any UI updates are rendered to ensure consistency.
  warnings: Ensure that the GatheringNode reference is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as invalid references could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the game logic.
