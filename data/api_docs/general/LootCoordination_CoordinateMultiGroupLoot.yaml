documentation:
  brief: Coordinates loot distribution among multiple groups in a World of Warcraft
    instance
  description: The CoordinateMultiGroupLoot method manages the process of distributing
    loot items to players across multiple groups within a raid or dungeon environment.
    This method is responsible for handling the complex logic required when loot needs
    to be shared between different group compositions, such as during group loot rolls
    or when splitting loot among multiple player parties. It ensures that the correct
    loot distribution rules are applied based on group membership, loot quality, and
    player roles within the instance.
  parameters:
  - name: groups
    description: An integer reference representing the number of groups participating
      in the loot coordination process. This value determines how many distinct group
      distributions will be handled during the loot operation.
  - name: item
    description: A constant reference to a LootItem object containing the details
      of the item being distributed. This includes item ID, stack size, and other
      loot properties that determine how the item should be allocated among groups.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Multi-Group Loot Coordination
    code: 'LootCoordination coordination;

      LootItem item;

      item.itemID = 12345;

      item.count = 1;

      int groupCount = 3;

      coordination.CoordinateMultiGroupLoot(groupCount, item);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Group Loot with Different Item Types
    code: 'LootCoordination coordination;

      LootItem armorItem;

      armorItem.itemID = 67890;

      armorItem.count = 1;

      armorItem.quality = ITEM_QUALITY_EPIC;

      int groupCount = 5;

      coordination.CoordinateMultiGroupLoot(groupCount, armorItem);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during loot distribution events in instances
    where multiple groups are present. The implementation handles the internal tracking
    of group members and ensures proper loot allocation according to World of Warcraft's
    group loot rules. It may involve complex calculations for determining item ownership
    when groups have different compositions.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method can lead to incorrect loot distribution
    or missing items from players' inventories. The method assumes that all participating
    groups are properly initialized and that the LootItem structure contains valid
    data before being passed to the function.
