  signature: ObjectGuid ObjectGuidFactory::CreateUniq(uint64 id)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique ObjectGuid identifier for use in TrinityCore's object
    management system.
  description: The CreateUniq method generates a globally unique identifier (GUID)
    for objects within the TrinityCore framework. This GUID is used to uniquely identify
    game entities such as players, creatures, game objects, and items throughout the
    server. The generated GUID follows the standard World of Warcraft GUID format
    which includes a type identifier, a counter, and a unique value. The method ensures
    that each call produces a distinct GUID that can be safely used in object tracking,
    networking, and database operations without collision risks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an ObjectGuid instance representing a unique identifier for a game
    object. The returned GUID contains the necessary components to identify the object
    type and ensure uniqueness across the entire server instance.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Unique GUID for a New Creature
    code: 'ObjectGuidFactory guidFactory;

      ObjectGuid creatureGuid = guidFactory.CreateUniq(12345);

      // creatureGuid now contains a unique identifier for the creature with entry
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during object creation when a new entity needs
    to be assigned a globally unique identifier. The implementation internally manages
    GUID counter state to ensure uniqueness, making it safe for concurrent use in
    multi-threaded environments.
