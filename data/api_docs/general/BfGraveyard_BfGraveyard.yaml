documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Battlefield Graveyard with the specified battlefield context.
  description: The BfGraveyard constructor initializes a graveyard instance within
    the context of a specific battlefield. This method sets up the necessary internal
    state and associations required for the graveyard to function properly within
    the battlefield system. The initialization process typically involves linking
    the graveyard to its parent battlefield, setting up event handlers, and preparing
    the graveyard for player interaction during battlefield events. This constructor
    is called internally by the battlefield framework when creating graveyard instances
    for battlegrounds.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);

      BfGraveyard graveyard(bf);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore battlefield
    management system. Developers should not directly instantiate BfGraveyard objects
    unless implementing custom battlefield logic. The constructor assumes that the
    provided Battlefield pointer is valid and properly initialized.
