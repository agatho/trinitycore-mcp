  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: GetTopSellers
  signature: int MarketAnalysis::GetTopSellers(uint32 itemId, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of top-selling items in the auction house market.
  description: The GetTopSellers method queries the auction house database to determine
    how many times a specific item has been sold within a given period or context.
    This method is typically used for market analysis and inventory tracking. It returns
    an integer representing the total number of sales for the specified item ID, which
    can be useful for determining item popularity, pricing strategies, or identifying
    high-demand products in the game economy.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item to query for top seller statistics.
      Must be a valid item entry from the game's item database.
  - name: count
    description: The maximum number of top sellers to retrieve or the threshold count
      for sales data. Used as an upper limit for results returned by the method.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the number of times the specified item
    was sold in the auction house. A return value of zero indicates no sales were
    recorded for that item, while a positive integer represents the total number of
    transactions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      int topSellers = analysis.GetTopSellers(18732, 10);

      // Returns the count of times item ID 18732 (e.g., a common weapon) was sold
      in the last 10 transactions.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Market Trend Analysis
    code: "MarketAnalysis analysis;\nuint32 itemId = 34567; // Example rare artifact\n\
      int salesCount = analysis.GetTopSellers(itemId, 50);\nif (salesCount > 0) {\n\
      \    printf(\"Item %u has been sold %d times in recent transactions\\n\", itemId,\
      \ salesCount);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No recent sales for item %u\\n\", itemId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction house data structures
    and may cache results to improve performance. The count parameter might influence
    how many records are considered when calculating top sellers, potentially affecting
    the returned value if used in a rolling window context.
  warnings: Ensure that the itemId provided is valid and corresponds to an actual
    item in the game database; otherwise, the method may return unexpected results
    or errors. Be cautious when using large count values as they could impact performance
    due to database queries.
