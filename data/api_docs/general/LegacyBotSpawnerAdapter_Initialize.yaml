  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter, setting up internal state and preparing
    for bot spawning operations.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter for use
    by performing necessary setup operations such as initializing internal data structures,
    loading configuration settings, and ensuring all required resources are available.
    This method should be called once before any other operations on the adapter.
    It performs validation checks to ensure that the environment is suitable for bot
    spawning and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the initialization
    process. The method may also register necessary event handlers or callbacks needed
    for the spawner's functionality within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: True if the initialization was successful and all required components were
    properly set up; false otherwise, indicating that the adapter cannot be used until
    the underlying issues are resolved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter spawner;\nbool success = spawner.Initialize();\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning operations\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle initialization failure\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to initialize\
      \ LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of an adapter
    instance. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks. The
    initialization process includes checking for valid configuration files and ensuring
    that necessary database connections are established.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper TrinityCore environment setup may result
    in crashes or incomplete initialization. Ensure that the core systems (database,
    world server) are fully operational before invoking Initialize.
