documentation:
  brief: Loads all suggestion tickets from the database into memory for processing.
  description: The LoadSuggestionTickets method initializes and populates the internal
    data structures of the SupportMgr class with all existing suggestion tickets stored
    in the database. This method is typically invoked during server startup or when
    the support system requires an updated view of user suggestions. It retrieves
    ticket data including submission time, author information, ticket content, and
    status flags. The method ensures that all pending and resolved suggestions are
    available for review by game masters and administrators through the support interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleServerBooted()\n{\n    sSupportMgr->LoadSuggestionTickets();\n\
      \    // Suggestion tickets are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database query that may block execution until all
    tickets are retrieved. It should ideally be called during server initialization
    or in a background thread to avoid impacting gameplay performance.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without clearing previous data may
    result in duplicate entries in internal ticket storage structures. Ensure proper
    synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
