  signature: void WorldSession::HandleTaxiQueryAvailableNodesOpcode(WorldPackets::Taxi::TaxiQueryAvailableNodes
    & taxiQueryAvailableNodes)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a client request to query available taxi nodes for flight path
    navigation.
  description: The HandleTaxiQueryAvailableNodesOpcode method handles incoming client
    packets requesting information about available taxi nodes that can be used for
    flight paths. This method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system
    and is invoked when a player interacts with a taxi master or attempts to access
    their flight map. It retrieves and sends back a list of reachable taxi nodes based
    on the player's current location, faction, and known flight paths. The method
    typically checks if the player has access to specific taxi nodes based on their
    quest progress, reputation, and character level requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: taxiQueryAvailableNodes
    description: A packet structure containing information about the taxi query request
      from the client, including the player's current location and any relevant filtering
      criteria.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling context
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleTaxiQueryAvailableNodesOpcode(WorldPackets::Taxi::TaxiQueryAvailableNodes&\
      \ taxiQueryAvailableNodes)\n{\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player)\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Process the available nodes for the player's current\
      \ location\n    SendTaxiNodeList(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during taxi master interactions or when players
    open their flight map. It requires proper access to the player object and assumes
    that the session has a valid connection to the client. The implementation may
    involve database lookups for flight path data and checks against player progress.
