  method: UpdateDeduplicationCache
  signature: void MovementArbiter::UpdateDeduplicationCache(uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the deduplication cache with current movement data to prevent redundant
    processing.
  description: The UpdateDeduplicationCache method is responsible for maintaining
    a cache of recent movement data within the MovementArbiter class. This cache helps
    prevent unnecessary processing of identical or duplicate movement updates, which
    can occur frequently in a high-frequency game environment like World of Warcraft.
    The method takes the current time as input and uses it to determine which entries
    in the cache are still relevant and should be retained. It is typically called
    during the game loop's update cycle to ensure that outdated or irrelevant movement
    data is removed from the cache, thereby optimizing performance and reducing memory
    usage. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining efficient movement handling across
    multiple players and NPCs in a shared world environment.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    movementArbiter.UpdateDeduplicationCache(getCurrentTime());\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called at regular intervals during the game loop's
    update cycle. The cache size and retention policy are implementation-specific
    but generally designed to balance memory usage with performance optimization.
    It's important that this method is called consistently with accurate timing information
    to ensure proper cache behavior.
  warnings: Improper timing or incorrect current time values can lead to cache inconsistencies,
    potentially causing movement updates to be incorrectly processed or discarded.
    This method should not be called from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
