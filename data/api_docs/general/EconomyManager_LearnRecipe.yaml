  signature: bool EconomyManager::LearnRecipe(uint32 recipeId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach a player a crafting recipe by its unique identifier.
  description: The LearnRecipe method is used to grant a player access to a specific
    crafting recipe within the EconomyManager system. This method typically checks
    if the recipe exists, verifies that the player has the necessary prerequisites
    (such as skill level or previous knowledge), and then updates the player's recipe
    list accordingly. It is commonly used in game systems where players can discover
    or purchase recipes through various means such as quest rewards, vendors, or achievements.
    The method returns true if the recipe was successfully learned, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: recipeId
    description: The unique identifier of the crafting recipe to be learned. This
      value must correspond to a valid recipe entry in the game's database.
  returns: Returns true if the recipe was successfully added to the player's known
    recipes, or false if the recipe could not be learned due to invalid ID, missing
    prerequisites, or other system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Recipe Learning
    code: "if (EconomyManager->LearnRecipe(12345)) {\n    // Recipe successfully learned\n\
      \    ChatHandler->PSendSysMessage(\"You have learned the recipe.\");\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Failed to learn recipe\n    ChatHandler->PSendSysMessage(\"Failed\
      \ to learn the recipe.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Recipe Before Learning
    code: "uint32 recipeId = 67890;\nif (sRecipeMgr->HasRecipe(recipeId)) {\n    if\
      \ (EconomyManager->LearnRecipe(recipeId)) {\n        Player->SendNotifyMessage(\"\
      You learned a new recipe!\");\n    } else {\n        Player->SendNotifyMessage(\"\
      Failed to learn the recipe.\");\n    }\n} else {\n    Player->SendNotifyMessage(\"\
      Invalid recipe ID.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal databases or caches that store
    player recipe knowledge. It may also trigger updates to the player's UI to reflect
    newly learned recipes, and could involve checks against player skill levels or
    other prerequisites.
  warnings: Ensure that the recipeId passed is valid and corresponds to an existing
    recipe in the database; passing an invalid ID may result in silent failure or
    unexpected behavior.
