  signature: void DemonologyWarlockRefactored::EnsureFelguardActive()
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that the demonology warlock's felguard pet is active and ready for
    use.
  description: The EnsureFelguardActive method checks whether the player's felguard
    pet is currently summoned and active. If the felguard is not active or has been
    dismissed, this method will attempt to summon or reactivate it. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining the warlock's combat effectiveness in demonology specialization,
    as the felguard serves as a key damage-dealing and utility-support pet. The method
    typically integrates with the warlock's spell casting system and pet management
    logic to ensure optimal resource usage and tactical positioning during encounters.

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI state machine and may trigger
    cooldown resets or resource allocation for the felguard. It should be called at
    appropriate intervals during combat to maintain pet availability.
