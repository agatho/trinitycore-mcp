  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: ExecutePhaseStrategy
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::ExecutePhaseStrategy(const BossStrategy * strategy,
    uint32 phase)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a boss strategy for the specified phase within the group coordinator's
    context.
  description: The ExecutePhaseStrategy method is responsible for applying a given
    BossStrategy to a specific phase within the GroupCoordinator's management system.
    This function orchestrates how different strategies are executed based on the
    current phase of a boss encounter, ensuring that appropriate actions and behaviors
    are triggered according to the defined strategy. It typically involves coordinating
    group members' responses, managing phase transitions, and executing relevant AI
    behaviors or actions tied to that particular phase. The method operates within
    the context of a raid or group encounter where multiple phases may exist with
    distinct mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: A pointer to the BossStrategy object defining the behavior and actions
      to be executed during this phase. Must not be null.
  - name: phase
    description: The numeric identifier representing the current phase of the boss
      encounter. Used to determine which strategy actions should be applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecutePhaseStrategy
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = ...;

      BossStrategy* strategy = new BossStrategy();

      coordinator->ExecutePhaseStrategy(strategy, 1);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing a phase strategy with dynamic phase value
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = GetGroupCoordinator();

      uint32 currentPhase = GetCurrentEncounterPhase();

      BossStrategy* activeStrategy = GetBossStrategyForPhase(currentPhase);

      coordinator->ExecutePhaseStrategy(activeStrategy, currentPhase);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the group coordinator during
    boss encounter management. It assumes that the provided strategy has been properly
    initialized and configured for the given phase. The method may involve synchronization
    with other systems such as AI state machines or event handlers.
  warnings: Ensure that the BossStrategy pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Also, be cautious about calling
    this method outside of proper encounter contexts, as it might lead to incorrect
    phase handling or group behavior.
