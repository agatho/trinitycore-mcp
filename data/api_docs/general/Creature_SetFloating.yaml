  class: Creature
  method: SetFloating
  signature: void Creature::SetFloating(bool floating)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the creature's floating status to enable or disable floating movement.
  description: The SetFloating method controls whether a creature can float above
    the ground, allowing it to move in mid-air. This is commonly used for creatures
    that need to be positioned in the air, such as flying creatures or those with
    special movement patterns. The method affects the creature's movement behavior
    and can be used to control how the creature interacts with terrain and ground
    collision. When set to true, the creature will float above ground; when set to
    false, it will return to normal ground-based movement.
  parameters:
  - name: floating
    description: A boolean value indicating whether the creature should float. True
      enables floating movement, false disables it and returns the creature to standard
      ground-based movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetFloating(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with movement control
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetFloating(false);

      // Creature now moves normally on ground

      creature->SetFloating(true);

      // Creature now floats above ground'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's movement behavior and should
    be used carefully when dealing with creatures that have specific positioning requirements.
    It may impact the creature's collision detection and pathfinding behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause creatures to behave unexpectedly
    in combat or movement scenarios, especially if the creature is expected to interact
    with ground-based mechanics. Always ensure that floating status matches the creature's
    intended behavior.
