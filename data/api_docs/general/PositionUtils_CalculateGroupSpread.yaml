  method: CalculateGroupSpread
  signature: float PositionUtils::CalculateGroupSpread(const int & players)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal spread distance for a group of players based on the
    number of players in the group.
  description: The CalculateGroupSpread method determines the appropriate spatial
    distribution between players in a group to maintain optimal positioning, typically
    used for coordinating player placement during raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
    This calculation considers the number of players in the group and returns a float
    value representing the recommended spread distance. The method is designed to
    ensure that groups are not too compact (which can cause collision issues) nor
    too spread out (which can lead to inefficient resource usage). It's commonly used
    in TrinityCore's group management systems for positioning logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated optimal spread distance between
    players in a group. The value is typically measured in yards and represents the
    minimum distance that should be maintained between group members to ensure proper
    positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float spread = PositionUtils::CalculateGroupSpread(5);

      // Returns the spread distance for a group of 5 players'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management
    code: "uint8 playerCount = playerGroup->GetMembersCount();\nfloat optimalSpread\
      \ = PositionUtils::CalculateGroupSpread(playerCount);\n// Use optimalSpread\
      \ to position group members in a raid\nfor (GroupReference* ref = playerGroup->GetFirstMember();\
      \ ref; ref = ref->next())\n{\n    Player* member = ref->getSource();\n    //\
      \ Apply spread logic using optimalSpread\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses a mathematical formula or lookup table to determine
    the appropriate spread based on group size. The implementation may be tuned for
    specific game mechanics such as spell AoE ranges, movement restrictions, or visual
    positioning in combat scenarios. It's recommended to cache this value if used
    frequently within a single operation to avoid repeated calculations.
  warnings: This method assumes that the input parameter represents a valid number
    of players (typically 1-40 for standard groups). If called with invalid parameters
    (e.g., negative numbers or extremely large values), the result may be undefined
    or produce unexpected positioning behavior. The returned value should not be used
    directly without considering environmental constraints like terrain or object
    placement.
