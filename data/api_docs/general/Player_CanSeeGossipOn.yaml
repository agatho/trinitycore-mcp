  signature: bool Player::CanSeeGossipOn(const Creature * creature) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can see the gossip options of a creature.
  description: The CanSeeGossipOn method checks if a player has the necessary conditions
    to view the gossip menu associated with a specific creature. This includes checking
    if the player is within range, has the required quest status, and meets any other
    prerequisites for viewing the gossip. The method is commonly used in conjunction
    with the gossip system to determine whether a creature's gossip options should
    be displayed to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: A pointer to the Creature object whose gossip options are being checked.
      This parameter must not be null and represents the creature that the player
      is interacting with.
  returns: Returns true if the player can see the gossip options of the creature,
    false otherwise. The method may return false due to various conditions such as
    distance, quest requirements, or player state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->CanSeeGossipOn(creature)) {\n    // Display gossip menu\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with quest checking
    code: "if (player->CanSeeGossipOn(creature) && player->GetQuestStatus(questId)\
      \ == QUEST_STATUS_INCOMPLETE) {\n    // Display gossip menu\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in the context of the World of Warcraft gossip
    system. It relies on the player's distance to the creature, quest status, and
    other game mechanics to determine visibility. Performance-wise, it's a lightweight
    check that does not involve complex calculations.
  warnings: The method assumes that the creature pointer is valid and not null. If
    used with an invalid pointer, it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also, the method may return false even if the player has the correct quest status
    but is too far from the creature.
