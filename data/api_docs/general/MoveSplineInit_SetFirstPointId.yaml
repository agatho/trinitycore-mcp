  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetFirstPointId
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetFirstPointId(int32 pointId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the identifier for the first point in a movement spline.
  description: The SetFirstPointId method assigns a unique identifier to the initial
    point of a movement spline used by units in TrinityCore. This identifier is typically
    used internally by the server to track and manage movement paths, particularly
    for creatures or players executing complex movement sequences. The method does
    not validate the provided ID against existing points but simply stores it for
    later use during spline execution. It's commonly called during the initialization
    phase of a unit's movement before the actual spline is built and executed.
  parameters:
  - name: pointId
    description: An integer identifier that uniquely represents the first point in
      the movement spline. This value is used internally by the server to reference
      the starting point of the movement path.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting First Point ID for a Creature Movement
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      MoveSplineInit init(creature);

      init.SetFirstPointId(1001);

      // Further initialization and spline building would follow'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetFirstPointId with Dynamic Point Assignment
    code: 'Unit* unit = ...;

      MoveSplineInit init(unit);

      int32 customPointId = GetNextAvailablePointId();

      init.SetFirstPointId(customPointId);

      // The spline will now reference this point ID for its starting position'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal movement system and should typically
    be used in conjunction with other MoveSplineInit methods like SetFinalDestination,
    SetMovementFlags, and Build(). The pointId parameter does not need to correspond
    to an actual point index in a path but serves as an identifier for tracking purposes
    within the spline system.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method may lead to inconsistencies in movement
    tracking or unexpected behavior in unit pathfinding. Ensure that point IDs are
    unique across different splines to avoid conflicts during execution.
