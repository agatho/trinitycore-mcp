  class: ArenaAI
  method: CoordinateOffensiveBurst
  signature: bool ArenaAI::CoordinateOffensiveBurst(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates an offensive burst ability for arena combat, determining if a
    player should initiate a burst attack.
  description: The CoordinateOffensiveBurst method is used in arena AI logic to determine
    whether a player should execute an offensive burst ability during combat. This
    method evaluates various conditions such as cooldowns, mana availability, and
    tactical positioning to decide if initiating a burst is beneficial. It returns
    true when the burst should be coordinated, otherwise false. The method is typically
    called during arena combat scenarios where timing and coordination of abilities
    are crucial for victory.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player index or identifier
      in the arena team. This parameter determines which specific player's burst ability
      should be coordinated.
  returns: Returns true if the offensive burst should be coordinated for the specified
    player, false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that all preconditions
    for executing a burst attack are met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in arena combat
    code: "int playerIndex = 0;\nif (arenaAI->CoordinateOffensiveBurst(&playerIndex))\
      \ {\n    // Execute offensive burst ability\n    player->CastSpell(target, BURST_SPELL_ID,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with loop over multiple players
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ARENA_PLAYERS; ++i) {\n    if (arenaAI->CoordinateOffensiveBurst(&i))\
      \ {\n        // Coordinate burst for player at index i\n        HandlePlayerBurst(i);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the arena AI system and should only be called during
    active arena combat. The method assumes that the player referenced by the 'player'
    parameter is currently in an arena match and available for action. Implementation
    details may vary based on specific arena rules and game balance settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the player index passed to this method is valid and within
    the bounds of the arena team. Passing an invalid player index can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. This method should not be called outside of arena combat
    contexts.
