  signature: bool GroupCoordination::HasReachedDestination() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a group coordination object has reached its intended destination.
  description: The HasReachedDestination method evaluates the current state of a GroupCoordination
    object to determine if the group has successfully arrived at its designated destination.
    This method is typically used in group movement scenarios within World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, such as when coordinating player movements for quests,
    instances, or scripted events. It checks internal movement state flags and position
    data against the target coordinates to make this determination. The method performs
    no side effects and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group has reached its destination; otherwise returns
    false. This indicates whether all members of the group have successfully navigated
    to the specified target location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (groupCoordination->HasReachedDestination()) {\n    // Group has arrived\
      \ at destination\n    SendGroupCompleteMessage();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Movement Logic
    code: "void UpdateGroupMovement() {\n    if (!groupCoordination->HasReachedDestination())\
      \ {\n        // Continue moving towards destination\n        MoveGroupTowardsTarget();\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Destination reached, trigger next phase\n        HandleArrivalEvent();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate position tracking and may return false if
    group members are still in transit or if there's a slight delay in position updates.
    It's recommended to use this method in conjunction with other movement validation
    checks for robust group coordination logic.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value means all group members have arrived
    simultaneously; individual member positions should be validated separately for
    critical scenarios requiring precise synchronization.
