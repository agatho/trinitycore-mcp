  brief: Resets combat resurrections for all players in the instance
  description: The ResetCombatResurrections method clears the combat resurrection
    state for all players currently within the instance. This function is typically
    called during instance reset procedures to ensure that no player retains a combat
    resurrection flag that could interfere with new encounters or prevent proper respawn
    mechanics. It effectively removes any active combat resurrection timers and resets
    associated flags, allowing players to properly engage in new combat scenarios
    without lingering effects from previous encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Instance Reset
    code: "void MyInstanceScript::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    // Reset combat\
      \ resurrections when a new player enters\n    ResetCombatResurrections();\n\
      }\n\nvoid MyInstanceScript::OnInstanceReset()\n{\n    // Reset combat resurrections\
      \ during instance reset\n    ResetCombatResurrections();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during instance reset procedures or when transitioning
    between different encounter phases to maintain proper game state. It's typically
    invoked automatically by the core system during certain instance events, but may
    also be manually triggered by custom scripts.
  warnings: Calling this method during active combat scenarios may cause unexpected
    behavior for players who are currently in combat. Ensure that this function is
    only called when it's safe to reset player states.
