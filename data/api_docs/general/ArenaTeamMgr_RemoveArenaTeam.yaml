  class: ArenaTeamMgr
  method: RemoveArenaTeam
  signature: void ArenaTeamMgr::RemoveArenaTeam(uint32 Id)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an arena team from the manager by its unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveArenaTeam method removes a specific arena team from the internal
    management system using its unique identifier. This operation typically occurs
    when an arena team is disbanded or deleted from the game world. The method ensures
    that all references to the arena team are cleared and any associated resources
    are properly released. It is commonly invoked during arena team destruction, player
    disbanding, or administrative removal processes within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: Id
    description: The unique identifier of the arena team to be removed. This value
      must correspond to an existing arena team in the system; otherwise, the operation
      may have no effect or could result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: ArenaTeamMgr::instance()->RemoveArenaTeam(12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Removal
    code: "if (arenaTeam && arenaTeam->GetId() > 0)\n{\n    ArenaTeamMgr::instance()->RemoveArenaTeam(arenaTeam->GetId());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal cleanup operations such as removing
    references from internal containers, notifying other subsystems about the removal,
    and potentially updating related data structures. It should be called only after
    ensuring that no further operations depend on the arena team being removed.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent arena team ID may
    lead to undefined behavior or silent failures. Always validate the existence of
    the arena team before calling RemoveArenaTeam.
