  method: UpdateMemoryStatistics
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::UpdateMemoryStatistics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal memory usage statistics for bot management within the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The UpdateMemoryStatistics method collects and records current memory
    consumption data related to bot operations in the TrinityCore world server. This
    includes tracking allocated memory blocks, active bot instances, and overall memory
    footprint used by the bot system. The method is typically invoked periodically
    or during significant bot lifecycle events to maintain accurate performance metrics.
    It helps administrators monitor resource usage and identify potential memory leaks
    or excessive consumption patterns within the bot subsystem.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Manager Context
    code: "void BotManager::UpdateAllBotMemoryStats()\n{\n    sBotMemoryManager->UpdateMemoryStatistics();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Performance Monitoring System
    code: "void PerformanceMonitor::CheckBotMemoryUsage()\n{\n    // Update memory\
      \ stats before reporting\n    sBotMemoryManager->UpdateMemoryStatistics();\n\
      \    \n    // Access collected statistics for logging or alerts\n    uint32\
      \ totalBots = sBotMemoryManager->GetTotalActiveBots();\n    uint64 memoryUsed\
      \ = sBotMemoryManager->GetTotalMemoryUsed();\n    \n    if (memoryUsed > MAX_ALLOWED_BOT_MEMORY)\n\
      \    {\n        sLog->outError(\"Bot memory usage exceeds threshold: %llu bytes\"\
      , memoryUsed);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to ensure accurate tracking of memory
    consumption. The statistics collected may include allocations from various bot
    subsystems such as AI decision trees, behavior patterns, and cached data structures.
    It's recommended to call this method during server maintenance windows or low-traffic
    periods to minimize performance impact.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    unnecessary overhead in the memory tracking system. Additionally, the collected
    statistics may not reflect real-time memory usage if the underlying memory management
    system uses lazy allocation patterns.
