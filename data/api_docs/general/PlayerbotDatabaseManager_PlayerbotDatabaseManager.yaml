documentation:
  brief: Initializes the playerbot database manager instance and sets up internal
    database connections for playerbot-related data storage.
  description: The PlayerbotDatabaseManager constructor initializes the database manager
    responsible for handling all database operations related to playerbots in TrinityCore.
    This includes establishing connections to the database, setting up necessary tables
    if they don't exist, and preparing internal structures for efficient data retrieval
    and storage. The method ensures that the database is ready to handle playerbot-specific
    queries such as bot configurations, behavior patterns, and saved states. It performs
    initialization tasks required for the playerbot system to function correctly within
    the game environment.

    code: 'PlayerbotDatabaseManager dbManager;

      // Constructor automatically initializes database connections

      // Ready to use for playerbot operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during server startup when the playerbot
    system is initialized. The initialization process may involve database schema
    checks and table creation if necessary. It's important to note that this method
    doesn't perform any actual database queries beyond establishing connections.
