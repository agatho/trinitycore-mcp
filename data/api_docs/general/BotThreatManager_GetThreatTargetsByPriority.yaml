  method: GetThreatTargetsByPriority
  signature: int BotThreatManager::GetThreatTargetsByPriority(ThreatPriority priority)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of threat targets for a specified priority level in
    the bot's threat management system.
  description: The GetThreatTargetsByPriority method returns the count of threat targets
    associated with a given threat priority level. This method is used within the
    BotThreatManager class to determine how many enemies are currently considered
    threats at a specific priority tier, such as high, medium, or low priority. The
    method operates on the internal threat target list managed by the bot's AI system
    and provides a way to assess the current combat situation based on threat levels.
    It is typically used for decision-making in bot behavior, such as determining
    whether to focus on a high-priority target or switch targets based on threat distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of threat targets associated with the
    specified priority level. Returns zero if no targets exist at that priority level
    or if the priority level is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get count of high-priority threat targets
    code: int highPriorityCount = botThreatManager.GetThreatTargetsByPriority(ThreatPriority::HIGH);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if any medium-priority threats exist
    code: "if (botThreatManager.GetThreatTargetsByPriority(ThreatPriority::MEDIUM)\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Bot has medium-priority threats to consider\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the internal state of the threat manager. It
    simply reads and returns a count from the existing threat target list. The method
    assumes that threat priorities are properly initialized and maintained by the
    bot's AI system. Performance is generally fast as it only involves counting elements
    in an internal container.
  warnings: Ensure that the ThreatPriority enum values passed to this method are valid,
    as invalid values may return unexpected counts or cause undefined behavior. This
    method should not be used to modify threat target data; it is strictly for reading
    purposes.
