  class: BehaviorCluster
  method: AddProfile
  signature: void BehaviorCluster::AddProfile(std::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile> profile)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player profile to the behavior cluster for AI processing and decision
    making.
  description: The AddProfile method integrates a PlayerProfile object into the BehaviorCluster,
    enabling the cluster to utilize the profile's data for AI-driven behaviors, decisions,
    and interactions. This method is typically invoked during player initialization
    or when new behavioral data needs to be considered by the AI system. The profile
    contains relevant player state information such as health, mana, position, inventory,
    and other contextual data that informs AI decision-making processes within the
    cluster. Once added, the profile becomes part of the cluster's active set and
    may influence behavior calculations during subsequent AI updates.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: A shared pointer to a PlayerProfile object containing player-specific
      behavioral data and state information. The profile must be valid and fully initialized
      before being added to ensure proper AI functionality.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile> myProfile = std::make_shared<PlayerProfile>(player);

      behaviorCluster->AddProfile(myProfile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Profiles
    code: "for (auto& player : playerList)\n{\n    std::shared_ptr<PlayerProfile>\
      \ profile = std::make_shared<PlayerProfile>(player);\n    behaviorCluster->AddProfile(profile);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the profile data itself, so
    it's assumed that the caller has properly initialized and validated the PlayerProfile
    before adding it. The method is thread-safe if the underlying cluster implementation
    supports concurrent access to its internal profile storage.
  warnings: Adding a profile that is already present in the cluster may lead to duplicate
    processing or unexpected behavior. Ensure that each profile is unique or implement
    proper deduplication logic before calling this method.
