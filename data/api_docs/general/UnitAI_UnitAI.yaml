  brief: Initializes the AI behavior for a Unit object
  description: The UnitAI constructor initializes the AI system for a given Unit instance.
    This method sets up the internal state and data structures required for the unit
    to function as an AI-controlled entity within the TrinityCore framework. It typically
    assigns default AI behaviors, initializes action queues, and prepares the unit's
    decision-making system. The initialization process is crucial for ensuring that
    AI-controlled creatures or NPCs can properly respond to environmental stimuli,
    execute combat behaviors, and follow scripted actions.

  examples:
  - title: Basic UnitAI Initialization
    code: 'Unit* myUnit = new Unit();

      UnitAI* ai = new UnitAI(myUnit);

      // The AI system is now initialized for the unit'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per Unit instance. Multiple calls
    may result in undefined behavior or memory leaks. The Unit parameter must not
    be null, as this would likely cause a crash during initialization.
  warnings: Never call this constructor directly on an already initialized UnitAI
    object. Always ensure the Unit pointer is valid and properly allocated before
    passing it to this constructor.
