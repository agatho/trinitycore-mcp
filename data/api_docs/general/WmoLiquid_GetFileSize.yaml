  class: WmoLiquid
  method: GetFileSize
  signature: uint32 WmoLiquid::GetFileSize()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total file size in bytes of the WMO liquid data structure.
  description: The GetFileSize method retrieves the total size, in bytes, of the WMO
    (World Map Object) liquid data associated with this instance. This size typically
    represents the combined size of all liquid-related data structures within the
    WMO group, including headers, vertices, and other liquid-specific information.
    The method is commonly used during file processing or memory management operations
    when determining how much data needs to be read from or written to disk. It does
    not perform any I/O operations itself but rather returns a pre-calculated size
    value stored within the object's internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total file size in bytes of the WMO liquid
    data structure. Returns zero if the object is uninitialized or contains no valid
    liquid data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine File Size
    code: "WmoLiquid liquid;\nuint32 size = liquid.GetFileSize();\nif (size > 0)\n\
      {\n    std::cout << \"WMO Liquid data size: \" << size << \" bytes\" << std::endl;\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    std::cout << \"No valid liquid data found.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the WmoLiquid object has been properly initialized
    with valid data. If called on an uninitialized or corrupted object, it may return
    incorrect values or zero. The returned size is typically used for buffer allocation
    or validation purposes during file loading processes.
  warnings: Do not rely on this value for runtime data integrity checks; it only reflects
    the pre-calculated size and does not validate whether the actual data matches
    that size. Calling this method on an object that has not been properly loaded
    may lead to misleading results.
