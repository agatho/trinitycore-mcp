  method: GetCreatorGUID
  signature: int GameObject::GetCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the GameObject's creator.
  description: The GetCreatorGUID method retrieves the GUID of the entity that created
    the GameObject, which could be a player, creature, or another game object. This
    method is essential for tracking ownership and relationships between game objects
    and their creators, particularly in scenarios involving summoning mechanics or
    quest-related interactions. The returned GUID represents the identifier of the
    creator entity, not necessarily the GameObject itself. This method is commonly
    used in game logic to determine which player or creature initiated a specific
    GameObject's creation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the creator entity. If no creator
    exists, it returns 0. The GUID value corresponds to the unique identifier of the
    entity that created the GameObject, typically either a player or creature.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int creatorGUID = gameObject->GetCreatorGUID();
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking if creator exists
    code: "if (gameObject->GetCreatorGUID() != 0)\n{\n    // Creator exists\n    GameObject*\
      \ creator = ObjectAccessor::GetObjectByGuid<WorldObject>(gameObject->GetCreatorGUID());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. Performance
    considerations are minimal as it simply retrieves stored data. Implementation
    details include that the GUID is stored in the GameObject's m_creatorGuid field,
    which is set during creation.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with objects that may not have a creator
    set. The returned value of 0 does not necessarily mean the GameObject was created
    by a player, but rather that no creator exists or has been set.
