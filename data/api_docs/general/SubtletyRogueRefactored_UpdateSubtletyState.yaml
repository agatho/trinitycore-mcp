  signature: void SubtletyRogueRefactored::UpdateSubtletyState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the subtlety state of the rogue player, managing stealth and invisibility
    mechanics.
  description: The UpdateSubtletyState method is responsible for maintaining and updating
    the current stealth and invisibility status of a Subtlety Rogue class character.
    This method typically handles the logic for entering or exiting stealth states,
    updating visual effects, managing combat visibility, and ensuring proper synchronization
    between the player's state and game mechanics. It may also handle cooldowns, energy
    costs, and interaction with other rogue abilities that depend on stealth status.
    The method is generally called during game loop updates or in response to specific
    player actions such as moving, attacking, or using stealth-related abilities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    rogue->UpdateSubtletyState();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Stealth Ability Trigger
    code: "void Rogue::UseStealthAbility()\n{\n    // ... perform stealth logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateSubtletyState();\n    // ... continue with other actions ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game engine during
    player state updates. Developers should be aware that this method may affect visual
    effects, combat behavior, and ability availability based on stealth status. It's
    important to ensure proper synchronization with other subsystems like movement,
    combat, and aura management.
  warnings: Improper handling of subtlety states can lead to visual inconsistencies
    or incorrect game behavior. This method should not be called directly from outside
    the core game loop without proper context checks to avoid race conditions or invalid
    state transitions.
