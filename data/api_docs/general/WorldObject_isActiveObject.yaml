  signature: bool WorldObject::isActiveObject() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a WorldObject is actively engaged in gameplay mechanics
    and is considered active.
  description: The isActiveObject method checks if a WorldObject is currently active
    within the game world, meaning it has valid state and is participating in gameplay
    interactions. This method typically evaluates whether the object is in a valid
    state for interaction or processing, such as being alive, not despised, or having
    an active presence in the game world. It serves as a critical indicator for determining
    if a WorldObject should be considered for further processing or interaction within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the WorldObject is actively engaged in gameplay mechanics
    and false otherwise. This indicates whether the object has valid state and is
    participating in active gameplay interactions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (worldObject->isActiveObject()) {\n    // Object is currently active\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal state flags or
    object status indicators to determine if the WorldObject is considered active.
    Performance considerations: The method should be lightweight and fast, as it may
    be called frequently during gameplay processing.'
  warnings: 'This method does not guarantee that the object will remain active in
    subsequent game ticks; it only indicates current activity status. Common mistake:
    Confusing isActiveObject with other state-checking methods like IsInWorld or IsAlive.'
