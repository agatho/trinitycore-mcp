documentation:
  brief: Sets threat value for a target and bot combination in the threat system
  description: The ThreatInfo::ThreatInfo method is used to assign or update a specific
    threat level between a bot and a target within the World of Warcraft AI threat
    management system. This method allows developers to directly manipulate the threat
    table that determines which units will be targeted by mobs during combat. The
    threat value influences mob targeting behavior, with higher values increasing
    the likelihood that a mob will attack the specified bot instead of other players
    or units in the area. This functionality is commonly used in custom AI scripts
    and botting systems to control mob focus and group dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit that will be affected
      by the threat value
  - name: bot
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot or unit that is generating
      the threat
  - name: threat
    description: The float value representing the threat level to be set. Higher values
      increase targeting priority
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Assignment
    code: 'ThreatInfo threatInfo;

      threatInfo.ThreatInfo(targetGuid, botGuid, 1000.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Threat to Control Mob Focus
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetVictim();\nUnit* bot = botAI->GetBot();\nif (target\
      \ && bot)\n{\n    ThreatInfo threatInfo;\n    threatInfo.ThreatInfo(target->GetGUID(),\
      \ bot->GetGUID(), 5000.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal threat table and bypasses normal
    combat mechanics. It should be used carefully as it can break expected gameplay
    behavior if not properly managed. The method operates on a per-unit basis and
    does not automatically propagate to group members or affect other units' threat
    calculations.
  warnings: Using this method with extremely high threat values may cause unexpected
    targeting behavior or client-side issues. Avoid calling this method in rapid succession
    as it may overwhelm the threat system. This method should only be used in controlled
    AI environments and never in standard player-facing code.
