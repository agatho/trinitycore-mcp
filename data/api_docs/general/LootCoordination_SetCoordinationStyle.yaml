  class: LootCoordination
  method: SetCoordinationStyle
  signature: void LootCoordination::SetCoordinationStyle(uint32 groupId, const std::string
    & style)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the loot coordination style for a specified group ID.
  description: The SetCoordinationStyle method configures the loot distribution behavior
    for a specific group within the TrinityCore framework. This method allows administrators
    or game systems to define how loot should be coordinated among group members,
    such as using round-robin, master loot, or free-for-all styles. The groupId parameter
    identifies the target group, while the style parameter specifies the desired coordination
    approach. This functionality is integral to managing loot distribution in World
    of Warcraft-style instances and dungeons where group-based loot sharing is required.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the group for which to set the loot coordination
      style. This value typically corresponds to a Group's GUID or internal ID within
      the TrinityCore system.
  - name: style
    description: A string representing the desired loot coordination style. Valid
      values may include 'roundrobin', 'masterloot', 'freeforall', or other system-defined
      styles depending on the implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Master Loot Style for Group
    code: LootCoordination::SetCoordinationStyle(12345, "masterloot");
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Round Robin Loot Distribution
    code: LootCoordination::SetCoordinationStyle(67890, "roundrobin");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group management systems and may
    require synchronization across multiple threads in a multi-threaded server environment.
    It's recommended to call this method before loot distribution begins to ensure
    consistency.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to inconsistent loot behavior for
    players in groups, potentially causing disputes or unexpected loot outcomes during
    dungeon or raid encounters.
