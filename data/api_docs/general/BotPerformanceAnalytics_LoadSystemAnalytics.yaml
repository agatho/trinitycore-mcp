  method: LoadSystemAnalytics
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::LoadSystemAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads system performance analytics data for bot behavior
    tracking.
  description: The LoadSystemAnalytics method is responsible for initializing and
    loading system-level performance metrics related to bot operations within the
    TrinityCore environment. This method typically retrieves or constructs data about
    CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and other system resources that
    impact bot performance. It serves as a foundational step in the analytics pipeline,
    preparing data structures necessary for monitoring and optimizing bot behavior.
    The method is usually invoked during server startup or when analytics modules
    are initialized, ensuring that performance baseline data is available for subsequent
    analysis and reporting.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleBotCommand()\n{\n    BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\n\
      \    analytics.LoadSystemAnalytics();\n    // Analytics data is now loaded and\
      \ ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs heavy I/O operations or system calls to gather
    performance metrics, so it should be called during server initialization rather
    than in high-frequency game loops. The implementation may involve reading from
    system files, querying OS-level APIs, or accessing cached performance data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper cleanup could lead to resource
    leaks or inconsistent analytics data. Ensure that any previously loaded analytics
    are properly disposed of before reloading.
