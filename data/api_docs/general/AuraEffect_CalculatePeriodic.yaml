  class: AuraEffect
  method: CalculatePeriodic
  signature: void AuraEffect::CalculatePeriodic(Unit * caster, bool resetPeriodicTimer,
    bool load)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the periodic tick interval for an aura effect based on caster
    and load state.
  description: The CalculatePeriodic method determines the time interval between periodic
    ticks of an aura effect. It adjusts the periodic timer based on the caster's influence,
    such as haste modifications or aura-specific scaling. This method is typically
    invoked during aura application or when periodic effects are recalculated. The
    resetPeriodicTimer flag controls whether to reset the current tick timer, while
    the load parameter indicates if the calculation is part of initial loading or
    runtime updates.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that cast the aura. Used to determine
      haste modifiers and other caster-based calculations.
  - name: resetPeriodicTimer
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to reset the current periodic timer.
      If true, the next tick will be scheduled from now; if false, the existing timer
      continues.
  - name: load
    description: Boolean flag indicating if this is being called during aura loading
      (initial application). Affects how certain calculations are performed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Aura Application
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = ...;

      Unit* caster = unit->GetOwner();

      effect->CalculatePeriodic(caster, true, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: During Aura Load with Reset
    code: 'AuraEffect* effect = ...;

      Unit* caster = aura->GetCaster();

      effect->CalculatePeriodic(caster, true, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal timer state and should only be called when
    the aura's periodic behavior needs to be recalculated. It does not directly trigger
    ticks but prepares the timing mechanism for future execution.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context may lead to incorrect tick
    intervals or unexpected behavior in periodic effects. Ensure that the caster pointer
    is valid before invoking this method.
