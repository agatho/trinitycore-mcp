  method: SimulateTimeSyncResponse
  signature: void BotPacketSimulator::SimulateTimeSyncResponse(uint32 counter)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a time synchronization response packet to simulate client-server time
    alignment in bot operations.
  description: The SimulateTimeSyncResponse method generates and sends a time synchronization
    response packet to the game client, simulating the behavior of a server-side time
    sync mechanism. This is typically used in botting scenarios where precise timing
    control is required to maintain synchronization with the game server. The method
    uses the provided counter value to construct the response packet, which helps
    ensure that bots can accurately simulate network latency and timing behaviors
    without being detected by anti-cheat systems. This functionality is particularly
    relevant for automated gameplay scripts or AI-driven character behavior simulation
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: counter
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer used to identify and track the time synchronization
      sequence. This value is typically incremented with each sync request to maintain
      proper ordering and prevent duplicate responses.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Time Sync Response Simulation
    code: 'BotPacketSimulator simulator;

      simulator.SimulateTimeSyncResponse(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sequential Time Sync Response with Counter Increment
    code: "BotPacketSimulator simulator;\nuint32 syncCounter = 0;\nfor (int i = 0;\
      \ i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    simulator.SimulateTimeSyncResponse(syncCounter++);\n\
      \    // Simulate delay between responses\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal bot simulation and testing
    purposes. The actual packet construction and sending logic would depend on the
    underlying TrinityCore network handling system. Developers should ensure that
    simulated timing responses do not violate game rules or anti-cheat policies when
    used in production environments.
  warnings: Using this method in live gameplay scenarios may be flagged by anti-cheat
    systems as suspicious behavior. The counter parameter must be managed carefully
    to avoid sequence number conflicts that could cause synchronization issues. This
    functionality should only be used in controlled testing environments or for legitimate
    automation purposes.
