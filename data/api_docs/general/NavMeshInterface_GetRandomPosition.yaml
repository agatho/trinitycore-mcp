  class: NavMeshInterface
  method: GetRandomPosition
  signature: bool NavMeshInterface::GetRandomPosition(Map * map, const int & center,
    float radius, int & result) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds a random valid position within a specified radius around a given center
    point on a map.
  description: The GetRandomPosition method attempts to locate a valid navigable position
    within a circular area defined by a center point and radius. It is commonly used
    in AI pathfinding, spawn point selection, or any scenario where a random but walkable
    location is needed. The method operates on the NavMesh of the specified map and
    ensures that the resulting position lies on a valid navmesh triangle. If successful,
    it populates the result parameter with the found position; otherwise, it returns
    false. This method is particularly useful for avoiding invalid terrain or obstacles
    in World of Warcraft's game world.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object on which to search for a random valid position.
      Must be a valid map instance.
  - name: center
    description: The center point around which the random position is searched. This
      parameter is passed by reference and represents the starting location for the
      search.
  - name: radius
    description: The maximum distance from the center point within which to find a
      valid random position. Must be a positive value.
  - name: result
    description: Reference to an integer that will be populated with the found valid
      position if successful. The actual format of this value depends on internal
      map representation, typically stored as a packed coordinate or index.
  returns: True if a valid random position was found within the specified radius;
    false otherwise. A return of false may occur if no valid navmesh triangle exists
    in the area or if the search parameters are invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find a random position near a player
    code: "Map* map = player->GetMap();\nint center = player->GetPositionX() * 1000;\n\
      float radius = 5.0f;\nint result;\nif (NavMeshInterface::GetRandomPosition(map,\
      \ center, radius, result)) {\n    // Use the found position\n    printf(\"Found\
      \ valid random position: %d\\n\", result);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No valid\
      \ position found within radius\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh data and assumes that
    the map has been properly initialized with navmesh information. Performance can
    vary depending on how densely the navmesh is populated in the area. The center
    parameter is expected to be a packed integer representation of coordinates, which
    may differ from standard floating-point values.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'map' pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Invalid or uninitialized maps will likely cause undefined behavior. Also,
    note that the result value should be interpreted according to the internal coordinate
    system used by TrinityCore's navigation system.
