  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: GetAvailableTemplates
  signature: int GuildEventCoordinator::GetAvailableTemplates()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of available guild event templates in the coordinator.
  description: The GetAvailableTemplates method returns an integer representing the
    number of guild event templates that are currently available for use within the
    GuildEventCoordinator. This count typically reflects the number of predefined
    or registered event types that can be instantiated by guilds for their activities.
    The method does not perform any side effects and is generally used to determine
    how many different event types are supported before attempting to create or manage
    guild events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value indicating the total number of available guild event templates.
    A return value of zero suggests no templates are registered or available for use.
  examples:
  - title: Check Available Event Templates
    code: "int templateCount = guildEventCoordinator->GetAvailableTemplates();\nif\
      \ (templateCount > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with creating a guild event using one\
      \ of the available templates\n    printf(\"%d guild event templates are available.\\\
      n\", templateCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where no templates exist\n\
      \    printf(\"No guild event templates found.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during initialization or when preparing to
    display options to players for creating new guild events. It's a read-only operation
    and does not modify any internal state of the GuildEventCoordinator.
