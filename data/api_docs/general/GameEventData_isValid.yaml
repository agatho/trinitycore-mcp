documentation:
  brief: Validates whether the game event data is in a consistent and usable state
  description: The isValid() method checks if the GameEventData object contains valid
    and complete information. It verifies that all required fields are properly initialized
    and that the event data adheres to internal consistency rules. This method is
    typically used before performing operations on game events to ensure data integrity.
    The validation may include checking for valid event IDs, proper time ranges, and
    non-null references to related objects. This method does not modify the object
    state and is safe to call at any time during the event's lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game event data is valid and consistent, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates that the event data has been corrupted,
    partially initialized, or contains invalid values that would prevent proper operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "GameEventData eventData;\n// ... populate eventData ...\nif (eventData.isValid())\
      \ {\n    // Proceed with event operations\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"world\", \"Event\
      \ data is valid, proceeding with processing\");\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ event data\n    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Invalid event data detected, skipping\
      \ operation\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in event handler
    code: "void HandleGameEvent(uint32 eventId) {\n    GameEventData* eventData =\
      \ sGameEventMgr->GetEventById(eventId);\n    if (!eventData || !eventData->isValid())\
      \ {\n        LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Invalid or missing event data for event\
      \ ID: {}\", eventId);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Safe to proceed with event\
      \ processing\n    ProcessEvent(eventData);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive check of the internal state and should
    not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths. The validation logic
    may evolve over time as new consistency rules are added to the game event system.
  warnings: Do not assume that a true return value guarantees that the event data
    will remain valid for future operations, especially if external modifications
    can occur. This method should be used primarily as a safety check before critical
    operations.
