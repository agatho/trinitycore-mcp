documentation:
  brief: Destroys an Item object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The Item destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory and resources
    allocated to an Item instance. It ensures that any dynamically allocated memory,
    including inventory slots, item data, and related structures, are properly released.
    This method is automatically called when an Item object goes out of scope or is
    deleted, preventing memory leaks and ensuring proper game state management. The
    destructor also handles cleanup of item-specific data such as enchantments, sockets,
    and binding status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Destruction
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      // ... use item ...

      delete item;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. It's important to note that this method does
    not directly handle database operations, as those are typically managed through
    separate methods like Item::SaveToDB().
  warnings: Improper use of item deletion can lead to memory corruption if the destructor
    is called multiple times on the same object, or if objects are deleted while still
    referenced elsewhere in the code.
