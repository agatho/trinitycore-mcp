documentation:
  brief: Initializes the priority order for rogue equipment slots.
  description: The InitializeRoguePriorities method sets up the default priority ranking
    for equipment slots specific to rogue characters in TrinityCore. This method configures
    which inventory slots (main hand, off-hand, ranged, etc.) are prioritized when
    determining optimal gear assignment for rogues. The initialization typically occurs
    during player creation or class-specific setup routines, ensuring that the EquipmentManager
    has proper slot priority data for optimizing loot distribution and gear management
    for rogue classes.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Player Initialization
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code ...\n \
      \   _equipmentManager.InitializeRoguePriorities();\n    // ... continue with\
      \ login process ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player instance during class-specific
    initialization. It modifies internal priority arrays used by the EquipmentManager's
    gear optimization algorithms and is typically invoked automatically during player
    creation or class switching.
