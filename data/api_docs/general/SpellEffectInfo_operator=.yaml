  brief: Moves the contents of another SpellEffectInfo object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for SpellEffectInfo transfers all resources
    and data from the source SpellEffectInfo object to the current object, leaving
    the source in a valid but unspecified state. This operation is typically used
    to efficiently transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory or other resources
    without performing a deep copy. In the context of TrinityCore's spell system,
    this operator allows for efficient management of spell effect data during spell
    processing and caching operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current SpellEffectInfo object after the move assignment
    has completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'SpellEffectInfo effect1;

      SpellEffectInfo effect2 = std::move(effect1);

      // effect1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // effect2 contains all the data that was in effect1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Spell Processing Context
    code: "void ProcessSpellEffects()\n{\n    SpellEffectInfo tempEffect;\n    //\
      \ ... populate tempEffect with spell data ...\n    \n    SpellEffectInfo currentEffect\
      \ = std::move(tempEffect);\n    // Efficiently transfer spell effect data\n\
      \    // tempEffect is now in a valid but unspecified state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator performs a move operation rather than a copy, which means it's
    more efficient than copy assignment for large objects. The source object after
    the move should not be used until it's assigned new data. In TrinityCore's spell
    system, this is particularly useful when transferring spell effect information
    between different spell handling contexts or when caching spell effects.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object is left
    in a valid but unspecified state. Using the source object afterward without reassigning
    it may lead to undefined behavior. Be careful not to accidentally use the moved-from
    object in subsequent operations.
