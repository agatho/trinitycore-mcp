  class: VehicleJoinEvent
  method: Abort
  signature: void VehicleJoinEvent::Abort(uint64 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Aborts the vehicle join event, canceling any pending vehicle boarding actions.
  description: The VehicleJoinEvent::Abort method terminates an ongoing vehicle boarding
    process, preventing the player from entering the vehicle. This method is typically
    called when the vehicle boarding sequence needs to be interrupted due to game
    state changes, player movement, or other conditions that make boarding invalid.
    The method ensures cleanup of any associated event data and may trigger necessary
    callbacks or notifications to maintain game consistency. It should only be invoked
    during active vehicle join events to prevent undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The GUID of the player or vehicle involved in the join event. This
      parameter is used to identify which specific boarding action should be aborted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Abort Vehicle Join Event for Player
    code: "void HandlePlayerVehicleJoin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_IN_VEHICLE))\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Assume we have a reference to the vehicle join\
      \ event\n    VehicleJoinEvent* event = sObjectAccessor->GetVehicleJoinEvent(player);\n\
      \    if (event)\n        event->Abort(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the context of an active vehicle
    join event. Calling it outside of such a context may result in undefined behavior
    or memory corruption.
  warnings: Improper use of this method, especially with invalid GUIDs or outside
    of proper event contexts, can lead to crashes or inconsistent game state. Always
    verify that a vehicle join event is active before calling Abort.
