documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CombatSpecializationBase instance and releases all associated
    resources.
  description: The destructor for the CombatSpecializationBase class is responsible
    for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the object's lifetime. This method ensures proper resource deallocation when an
    instance of CombatSpecializationBase goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's combat system, this may involve releasing references
    to specialization data, clearing internal caches, or notifying related systems
    about the specialization's destruction. The destructor is automatically invoked
    by the C++ runtime and should not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of CombatSpecializationBase instance
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = new CombatSpecializationBase();

      // ... use the specialization ...

      delete spec; // Destructor is automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is a virtual function in the base class, which means that
    if derived classes exist, their destructors will be properly invoked when deleting
    through a base pointer. This ensures correct cleanup of polymorphic objects.
