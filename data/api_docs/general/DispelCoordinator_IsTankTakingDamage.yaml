documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the tank unit in the current context is currently taking damage.
  description: The IsTankTakingDamage method evaluates the current state of the tank
    unit within a DispelCoordinator context to determine if it is receiving damage.
    This functionality is typically used in dispel mechanics or spell management systems
    where the behavior of dispelling effects may depend on whether the target unit
    (specifically the tank) is under active damage. The method does not modify any
    internal state but provides a read-only check that can be used to make conditional
    decisions during spell processing or dispel logic execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the tank unit is currently taking damage, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the tank has an active damage state that may affect dispel
    behavior or cooldowns.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dispel Logic
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator.IsTankTakingDamage()) {\n    // Apply special dispel\
      \ effects or modify cooldown\n    target->RemoveAura(SPELL_ID_DISPEL_AURA);\n\
      } else {\n    // Standard dispel behavior\n    target->RemoveAura(SPELL_ID_NORMAL_DISPEL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal tracking of the tank's damage state,
    possibly through combat logs or unit status flags. It may not be thread-safe if
    accessed from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the DispelCoordinator instance is properly initialized with
    a valid tank reference before calling this method. Calling IsTankTakingDamage()
    on an uninitialized or invalid coordinator may result in undefined behavior.
