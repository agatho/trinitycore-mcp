documentation:
  brief: Destroys a TargetAssistAction instance and releases associated resources.
  description: The ~TargetAssistAction destructor is responsible for cleaning up memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a TargetAssistAction object. This
    method ensures proper deallocation of any dynamically allocated data members and
    performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor would typically be called when an
    AI action is removed from a creature's action list or when the AI system is shutting
    down. The method does not take any parameters and returns no value.

  returns: null

  - title: Automatic destruction of TargetAssistAction
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    TargetAssistAction* action = new TargetAssistAction();\n\
      \    // ... use the action ...\n    delete action; // This calls the destructor\
      \ ~TargetAssistAction()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not call this destructor directly
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process
    follows standard C++ RAII principles.
