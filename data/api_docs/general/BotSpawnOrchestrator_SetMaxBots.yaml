  method: SetMaxBots
  signature: void BotSpawnOrchestrator::SetMaxBots(uint32 maxBots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of bots that can be spawned by the orchestrator
  description: The SetMaxBots method configures the upper limit for the number of
    bot characters that the BotSpawnOrchestrator is allowed to create and manage.
    This method typically affects how many bots will be spawned during automated spawning
    processes, and may influence resource allocation and performance considerations
    within the TrinityCore environment. The setting takes effect immediately and can
    be called at any time, though changing it while bots are active may not immediately
    affect existing spawns. This method is commonly used in bot management systems
    to control server load and ensure proper resource usage.
  parameters:
  - name: maxBots
    description: The maximum number of bots allowed to be spawned by this orchestrator.
      Must be a non-negative integer value representing the desired cap on bot count.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Bot Count
    code: 'BotSpawnOrchestrator orchestrator;

      orchestrator.SetMaxBots(50);

      // Sets the maximum number of bots to 50'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Bot Limit Dynamically
    code: "void AdjustBotLimit(uint32 newLimit) {\n    BotSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator\
      \ = GetBotOrchestrator();\n    if (orchestrator) {\n        orchestrator->SetMaxBots(newLimit);\n\
      \    }\n}\n// Dynamically adjusts bot limit based on server conditions"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided value exceeds system limits
    or available resources. It simply sets the internal maximum value for bot spawning.
    The actual spawning behavior may be subject to additional constraints such as
    memory limits, CPU usage thresholds, or server configuration settings.
  warnings: Modifying the maximum bot count while bots are actively spawned or in
    use may lead to unexpected behavior. It's recommended to call this method when
    no bots are currently active or during maintenance windows to avoid potential
    conflicts with existing bot operations.
