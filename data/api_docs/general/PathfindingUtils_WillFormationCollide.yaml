  class: PathfindingUtils
  method: WillFormationCollide
  signature: bool PathfindingUtils::WillFormationCollide(const int & formation, const
    int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified formation will collide with given obstacles
    in the pathfinding system.
  description: The WillFormationCollide method evaluates if a particular formation
    configuration, defined by the 'formation' parameter, would result in a collision
    with existing obstacles represented by the 'obstacles' parameter. This utility
    is used within TrinityCore's AI and pathfinding subsystems to ensure that units
    move safely without overlapping with environmental or dynamic obstacles. The method
    performs a logical check based on internal pathfinding data structures and returns
    true if a collision is detected, false otherwise. It is typically invoked before
    attempting to execute a formation movement to prevent invalid paths from being
    calculated.
  parameters:
  - name: formation
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific formation pattern
      to be evaluated for potential collisions. This value usually corresponds to
      predefined formation types such as line, circle, or wedge formations.
  - name: obstacles
    description: An integer bitmask or identifier representing the set of obstacles
      that may interfere with the specified formation. Each bit or value in this parameter
      typically maps to a specific obstacle type or location within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the specified formation is determined to collide with any
    of the provided obstacles; otherwise, returns false. A return value of true indicates
    that pathfinding should avoid using this formation in the current context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "bool collision = PathfindingUtils::WillFormationCollide(FORMATION_LINE,\
      \ OBSTACLE_WALL);\nif (collision) {\n    // Handle formation avoidance logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Collision Check with Multiple Obstacles
    code: "int formationType = FORMATION_WEDGE;\nint obstacleMask = OBSTACLE_WALL\
      \ | OBSTACLE_BUILDING | OBSTACLE_UNIT;\nbool willCollide = PathfindingUtils::WillFormationCollide(formationType,\
      \ obstacleMask);\nif (willCollide) {\n    // Adjust formation or find alternative\
      \ path\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal pathfinding data structures and assumes that
    the formation and obstacle parameters are valid identifiers within the context
    of the current map or zone. It does not perform real-time collision detection
    but rather evaluates precomputed or cached information about formations and obstacles.
  warnings: Ensure that the formation and obstacle identifiers passed to this method
    are valid for the current game state; invalid values may lead to unexpected behavior
    or incorrect results. This method should not be used in performance-critical code
    paths without prior optimization, as it may involve complex internal checks.
