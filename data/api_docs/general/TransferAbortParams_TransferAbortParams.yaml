  class: TransferAbortParams
  method: TransferAbortParams
  signature: void TransferAbortParams::TransferAbortParams(TransferAbortReason reason,
    uint8 arg, int32 mapDifficultyXConditionId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a TransferAbortParams object with specified abort reason, argument,
    and map difficulty condition ID.
  description: The TransferAbortParams constructor initializes an object used to store
    parameters related to a transfer abort event in the TrinityCore framework. This
    class is typically used when a player's teleportation or zone transition is interrupted,
    storing information about why the transfer was aborted. The reason parameter indicates
    the cause of the abort, the arg parameter provides additional context-specific
    data, and the mapDifficultyXConditionId specifies any related difficulty condition
    that may have triggered the abort.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: The reason for the transfer abort, typically an enum value indicating
      why the player's movement was cancelled. Common values include reasons like
      invalid target, player busy, or insufficient permissions.
  - name: arg
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer providing additional context-specific argument
      related to the abort reason. The meaning of this value depends on the specific
      transfer abort reason provided.
  - name: mapDifficultyXConditionId
    description: An integer identifier for a map difficulty condition that may have
      caused or influenced the transfer abort. This is typically used in scenarios
      involving dungeon difficulties, raid modes, or other condition-based restrictions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: TransferAbortParams params(TRANSFER_ABORT_REASON_INVALID_TARGET, 1, 456);
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in a Transfer Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerTransfer(Player* player, uint32 mapId) {\n    if (!CanPlayerTransfer(player,\
      \ mapId)) {\n        TransferAbortParams abortParams(TRANSFER_ABORT_REASON_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS,\
      \ 0, 0);\n        // Process the abort parameters\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by TrinityCore's movement and
    transfer systems. The parameters should be carefully selected to match the specific
    abort scenario. The mapDifficultyXConditionId parameter may be set to zero if
    no difficulty condition applies.
  warnings: Ensure that the reason parameter corresponds to a valid enum value defined
    in the TransferAbortReason enumeration. Incorrect values may lead to unexpected
    behavior or errors during transfer processing.
