documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current phase mask value for the PhaseShift object
  description: The GetPhases method returns a constant reference to an integer representing
    the active phase mask of the PhaseShift object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    phases are used to control visibility and interaction of game objects, players,
    and environments based on specific conditions or events. This method allows access
    to the underlying phase mask value without modifying it, enabling systems to check
    current phase states for conditional logic, visibility checks, or event management.
    The returned integer typically represents a bitmask where each bit corresponds
    to a specific phase ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the current phase mask.
    This value is typically a bitmask where individual bits represent different phase
    IDs active for this object. The exact interpretation depends on the game's phase
    system implementation and may include multiple active phases combined through
    bitwise OR operations.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Current Phase State
    code: "PhaseShift* phaseShift = player->GetPhaseShift();\nconst int& currentPhases\
      \ = phaseShift->GetPhases();\nif (currentPhases & PHASE_MASK_RAID_10MAN)\n{\n\
      \    // Player is in 10-man raid phase\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Phase Mask Debug Output
    code: 'PhaseShift* phaseShift = unit->GetPhaseShift();

      const int& phases = phaseShift->GetPhases();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("phase", "Current phase mask: %d (0x%X)", phases, phases);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data stored within the PhaseShift
    object. Modifying the referenced value directly through this reference is not
    recommended as it may cause inconsistencies in the phase system. The method is
    designed to be read-only and should only be used for inspection purposes. Performance
    is generally good as it's a simple data retrieval operation.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference directly as it may corrupt internal
    phase state management. The phase mask value represents a bitmask that can contain
    multiple active phases simultaneously, so bitwise operations should be used when
    checking specific phase conditions rather than direct equality comparisons.
