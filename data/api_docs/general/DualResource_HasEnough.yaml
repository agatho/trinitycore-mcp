documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has sufficient primary and secondary resource amounts
    to cast a spell or ability
  description: The HasEnough method evaluates whether the current player character
    possesses adequate amounts of both primary and secondary resources (such as mana
    and rage, or energy and focus) to execute a specific spell or ability. This method
    is typically used during spell casting validation to prevent execution when resource
    requirements are not met. It performs a comparison against internal resource values
    stored within the DualResource object, ensuring that both resource types meet
    or exceed their required thresholds. The method does not modify any resource values
    but simply returns a boolean result indicating whether the condition is satisfied.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if both primary and secondary resource amounts are sufficient
    for the requested action; otherwise returns false
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check Before Spell Casting
    code: "if (player->GetDualResource()->HasEnough(100, 50)) {\n    // Player has\
      \ enough mana (100) and rage (50)\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FIREBALL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Not enough resources\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough resources\
      \ to cast the spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that primaryCost and secondaryCost are passed as absolute
    values required for the action. It should be called before attempting to consume
    resources to avoid invalid operations.
