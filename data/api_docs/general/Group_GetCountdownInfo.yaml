  method: GetCountdownInfo
  signature: const CountdownInfo * Group::GetCountdownInfo(CountdownTimerType timerType)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves countdown information for a specified timer type within the group.
  description: The GetCountdownInfo method returns a pointer to the CountdownInfo
    structure that contains details about an active countdown timer of the specified
    type within the group. This method is typically used in group-based game mechanics
    such as raid encounters, dungeon timers, or other time-sensitive events where
    group members need to be synchronized with countdowns. The returned pointer may
    be null if no countdown of the specified type is currently active. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is safe for read-only access.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a CountdownInfo structure containing the countdown details
    for the specified timer type, or nullptr if no such countdown is active.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Active Countdown
    code: "if (Group* group = player->GetGroup())\n{\n    const CountdownInfo* info\
      \ = group->GetCountdownInfo(COUNTDOWN_TIMER_RAID);\n    if (info)\n    {\n \
      \       // Process active raid countdown\n        sLog->outString(\"Raid countdown\
      \ active: %u seconds\", info->timeLeft);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      No active raid countdown\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in conjunction with group-based timers and
    encounter mechanics. The CountdownInfo structure typically contains timeLeft,
    timerType, and other relevant metadata about the countdown state. The returned
    pointer remains valid only as long as the countdown exists and the group's internal
    state hasn't changed.
