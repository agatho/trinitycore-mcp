  method: DecreaseKicksLeft
  signature: void LfgGroupData::DecreaseKicksLeft()
documentation:
  brief: Decrements the number of remaining kicks allowed for a LFG group.
  description: The DecreaseKicksLeft method reduces the internal counter that tracks
    how many times a group can be kicked from a Looking For Group (LFG) dungeon. This
    mechanism prevents abuse by limiting the number of times players can be removed
    from a group, ensuring fair play and preventing spamming or exploitation. The
    method is typically called when a player is kicked from a group, and it updates
    the internal kick counter accordingly. It does not perform any validation checks
    on the current kick count before decrementing.

  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Kick Logic
    code: "void HandlePlayerKick(Player* player, LfgGroupData* groupData)\n{\n   \
      \ // Some logic determines that a kick is necessary\n    if (groupData->GetKicksLeft()\
      \ > 0)\n    {\n        groupData->DecreaseKicksLeft();\n        // Proceed with\
      \ kick logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should only be called when a kick
    is actually performed. It's part of the LFG system's anti-abuse measures, and
    the kick counter is usually initialized to a fixed value (e.g., 3) upon group
    creation.
