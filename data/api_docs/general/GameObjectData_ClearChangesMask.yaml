documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the game object data, resetting its modification
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a GameObjectData instance. This mask is typically used to track which fields
    of the game object have been modified since the last update or synchronization.
    By clearing the mask, the system effectively marks all fields as 'unchanged',
    which can be useful when preparing for a new synchronization cycle or when explicitly
    resetting the modification state of the object. This method is commonly called
    during server-side updates, packet sending, or before applying changes to ensure
    clean state tracking.

  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Synchronization
    code: "GameObjectData* data = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectData(12345);\nif (data)\n\
      {\n    data->ClearChangesMask();\n    // Proceed with sending updated packet\
      \ or further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify any game object data itself, but only resets
    the internal tracking mechanism. It's typically used in conjunction with other
    GameObjectData methods to manage synchronization state between server and client.
