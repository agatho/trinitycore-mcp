  class: DruidBaselineRotation
  method: ApplyBuffs
  signature: void DruidBaselineRotation::ApplyBuffs(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Applies necessary buffs to the Druid bot character based on current game
    state and rotation logic.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buff spells to the Druid bot character. This includes managing both personal buffs
    such as Rejuvenation, Regrowth, and Innervate, as well as group buffs like Mark
    of the Wild or Gift of the Wild when applicable. The method evaluates the current
    health status, mana levels, and combat readiness of the bot to decide which buffs
    should be cast. It also considers the presence of other players in the group and
    their needs to optimize buff distribution. This method is typically called during
    the rotation cycle to ensure the Druid maintains optimal performance in both PvE
    and PvP scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in Rotation Cycle
    code: "void DruidBaselineRotation::Update()\n{\n    // ... other rotation logic\
      \ ...\n    ApplyBuffs(&bot);\n    // ... continue with other actions ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after checking for valid targets and before
    performing any damage-dealing abilities. The implementation may vary based on
    the specific Druid specialization (Balance, Feral, Restoration) and current combat
    situation.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot's mana is sufficient before calling this method to
    avoid casting failed spells. The method assumes proper target selection has already
    been performed by higher-level rotation logic.
