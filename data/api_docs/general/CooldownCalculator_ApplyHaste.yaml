  class: CooldownCalculator
  method: ApplyHaste
  signature: uint32 CooldownCalculator::ApplyHaste(uint32 cooldownMs, float hastePercent)
documentation:
  brief: Applies haste percentage to reduce a cooldown duration.
  description: The ApplyHaste method modifies a given cooldown duration by applying
    a haste percentage modifier. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft-style
    gameplay to adjust spell or ability cooldowns based on player haste stats. The
    method calculates the new cooldown time by reducing the original cooldown based
    on the provided haste percentage, ensuring that the result is never less than
    1 millisecond. Haste percentages above 100% will reduce cooldowns below their
    base values, while negative haste percentages will increase them.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The original cooldown duration in milliseconds to be modified by
      the haste percentage.
  - name: hastePercent
    description: The haste percentage to apply, where positive values reduce cooldowns
      and negative values increase them. Values are expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.25
      for 25% haste).
  returns: Returns the modified cooldown duration in milliseconds after applying the
    haste modifier. The result is always at least 1 millisecond, even with high haste
    percentages.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Haste Application
    code: 'CooldownCalculator calculator;

      uint32 baseCooldown = 5000; // 5 seconds

      float haste = 0.2f; // 20% haste

      uint32 newCooldown = calculator.ApplyHaste(baseCooldown, haste);

      // newCooldown will be approximately 4000 milliseconds (4 seconds)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Negative Haste Application
    code: 'CooldownCalculator calculator;

      uint32 baseCooldown = 3000; // 3 seconds

      float haste = -0.15f; // 15% reduced haste (slower)

      uint32 newCooldown = calculator.ApplyHaste(baseCooldown, haste);

      // newCooldown will be approximately 3450 milliseconds (3.45 seconds)'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input cooldown is in milliseconds and that haste
    percentages are expressed as decimal values. The calculation uses integer arithmetic,
    so results may have minor rounding differences depending on the exact values used.
    This function is typically used within combat or spell processing systems where
    cooldowns need to be dynamically adjusted based on character stats.
  warnings: Be cautious when applying large negative haste values, as they can significantly
    increase cooldown times and potentially cause unexpected behavior in gameplay
    mechanics. Also, ensure that the input cooldownMs is a positive value to avoid
    unintended results from zero or negative inputs.
