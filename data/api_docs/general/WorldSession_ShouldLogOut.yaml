documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the session should log out based on the current time.
  description: The ShouldLogOut method evaluates whether a WorldSession instance should
    proceed with the logout process at the given time. This method is typically used
    to manage session timeouts, graceful disconnections, or scheduled logout procedures
    within the TrinityCore framework. It checks internal session state and timing
    conditions to decide if logout is warranted. The method does not perform the actual
    logout but returns a boolean indicating whether the logout logic should be triggered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the session should log out at the specified time, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in logout check
    code: "if (session->ShouldLogOut(getCurrentTime())) {\n    session->LogoutPlayer(true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the core session management system
    to determine when to trigger logout events. It may be called during periodic maintenance
    loops or in response to client disconnection signals.
