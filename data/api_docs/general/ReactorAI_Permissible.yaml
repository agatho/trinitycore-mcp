  class: ReactorAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int ReactorAI::Permissible(const int * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ReactorAI class can be used for a given creature type.
  description: The Permissible method is used to evaluate if the ReactorAI behavior
    can be applied to a specific creature. It returns an integer value indicating
    the level of permissibility, typically used by the AI system to decide which AI
    handler should manage a creature. A positive return value usually indicates strong
    suitability, zero means not suitable, and negative values may indicate conditional
    or weak suitability. This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and
    helps in dynamically assigning appropriate AI behaviors based on creature properties.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature type ID or related
      identifier used to determine AI applicability.
  returns: Returns an integer value where positive values indicate strong suitability
    for using ReactorAI, zero means not suitable, and negative values may indicate
    conditional or weak suitability for the AI behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check AI applicability
    code: "int creatureType = 12345;\nint permissibleValue = reactorAI->Permissible(&creatureType);\n\
      if (permissibleValue > 0)\n{\n    // ReactorAI is suitable for this creature\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or assignment to
    determine if a specific AI class should be used for a creature. The exact meaning
    of return values may vary depending on the implementation within the TrinityCore
    codebase.
