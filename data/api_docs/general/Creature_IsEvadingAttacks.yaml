  class: Creature
  method: IsEvadingAttacks
  signature: bool Creature::IsEvadingAttacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is currently evading attacks from its current
    target.
  description: This method checks if a creature is actively evading attacks, which
    typically occurs when the creature's health drops below a certain threshold or
    when it has been commanded to flee by its owner. The method returns true when
    the creature is in an evading state, indicating that it is no longer engaging
    in combat but instead attempting to escape from its current target. This behavior
    is commonly observed during boss encounters or when creatures are under specific
    control conditions such as being commanded to flee by player characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is currently evading attacks, false otherwise.
    The method returns false when the creature is actively engaged in combat or when
    it has not yet entered an evading state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->IsEvadingAttacks())\n{\n    // Perform evading actions\n\
      \    creature->GetAI()->DoEvade();\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with AI behavior to determine
    when a creature should be evading. It may be called during combat or non-combat
    situations, and the implementation may vary depending on how the creature's evading
    state is managed internally.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combination with other
    evading-related functions, as misusing it can lead to incorrect behavior in combat
    situations. Also note that this method does not directly affect the creature's
    movement or combat state but rather indicates whether it is currently evading.
