  signature: uint32 World::GetActiveSessionCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of currently active client sessions connected to
    the world server
  description: The GetActiveSessionCount method retrieves the count of all active
    player sessions currently connected to the TrinityCore world server. This includes
    all players who are logged in and actively playing, but excludes inactive or disconnected
    sessions. The value represents the real-time number of connected clients that
    can receive and process game updates. This method is commonly used for server
    monitoring, load balancing decisions, and administrative oversight of server population
    metrics. The returned count is thread-safe and reflects the current state of active
    connections at the time of the call.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of currently active client
    sessions connected to the world server. This number includes all logged-in players
    but excludes disconnected or pending connections.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Server Monitoring
    code: 'uint32 activePlayers = sWorld->GetActiveSessionCount();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, "Current active player sessions: %u", activePlayers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Session Count for Load Balancing Logic
    code: "uint32 sessionCount = sWorld->GetActiveSessionCount();\nif (sessionCount\
      \ > 1000)\n{\n    TC_LOG_WARN(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High player load detected:\
      \ %u active sessions\", sessionCount);\n    // Implement throttling or warning\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of the current active session count and is
    not updated in real-time during server operations. The implementation uses thread-safe
    access patterns to ensure consistency across concurrent server operations. The
    value returned includes all valid player sessions but excludes GM-only or system
    connections that may not represent actual gameplay.
  warnings: The session count returned by this method reflects only active connections
    at the moment of the call. For continuous monitoring, repeated calls should be
    spaced appropriately to avoid excessive overhead. This method does not account
    for pending connections or authentication states, only fully established sessions.
