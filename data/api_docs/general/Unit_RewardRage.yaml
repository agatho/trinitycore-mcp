  description: The RewardRage method is used to return rage points to a Unit after
    a combat action has occurred. This method typically occurs when a player or NPC
    performs an attack or receives damage, and the rage points are returned to the
    unit's rage resource. The method is commonly used in conjunction with other combat-related
    functions to manage the unit's rage system during gameplay. It is essential for
    maintaining proper combat mechanics within the game's engine.

  returns: Returns the amount of rage points that were awarded to the unit, which
    can be positive or negative depending on the context of the reward.

      int32 ragePoints = unit->RewardRage(10);

      // This will return 10 rage points to the unit'

  notes: This method is typically used in combat situations and may be called by both
    player and NPC units. It should be noted that this method does not directly affect
    the unit's rage value, but rather returns rage points to it.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect rage values being returned
    to the unit, which may cause issues in combat mechanics or gameplay balance.
