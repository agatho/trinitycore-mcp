  class: Unit
  method: ApplyAttackTimePercentMod
  signature: void Unit::ApplyAttackTimePercentMod(int att, float val, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a percentage modifier to the attack time of the unit.
  description: This method modifies the attack time of a Unit by applying a percentage
    change to its base attack speed. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's combat
    system to adjust weapon speed or spell casting times based on various buffs, debuffs,
    or effects. The method takes into account the attack time value and applies the
    specified percentage modifier, either increasing or decreasing it. This functionality
    is essential for implementing game mechanics such as haste effects, slow effects,
    or other time-based modifiers that influence combat timing.
  parameters:
  - name: att
    description: The attack time value to be modified. This typically represents the
      base attack speed in milliseconds.
  - name: val
    description: The percentage modifier value to apply. Positive values increase
      attack time, while negative values decrease it.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply or remove the modifier.
      True applies the modifier, false removes it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->ApplyAttackTimePercentMod(1000, 25.0f, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example with multiple modifiers
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->ApplyAttackTimePercentMod(1000, 10.0f, true);

      unit->ApplyAttackTimePercentMod(1000, -5.0f, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely modifies internal attack time
    calculations rather than directly changing the attack speed value. Performance
    considerations: The method should be used carefully in high-frequency combat scenarios
    to avoid performance issues. Thread safety: The method is not thread-safe and
    should not be called from multiple threads simultaneously.'
  warnings: 'Common mistakes: Using incorrect values for ''att'' can lead to unexpected
    behavior. Dangerous edge cases: Applying negative percentage modifiers may cause
    the attack time to become zero or negative, which could lead to invalid combat
    states.'
