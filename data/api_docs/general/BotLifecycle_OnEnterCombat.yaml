documentation:
  brief: Executes bot-specific actions when the bot enters combat mode
  description: The OnEnterCombat method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when
    a bot transitions into combat state. This method serves as a hook for custom bot
    behavior during combat initiation, allowing developers to implement specific AI
    logic, target selection, or tactical responses. The method is typically called
    automatically by the game engine when the bot's combat state changes, and it should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required by custom extensions. It
    does not accept any parameters and performs no return value operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "void MyBot::OnEnterCombat()\n{\n    // Custom logic when bot enters combat\n\
      \    SendChatMessage(\"Engaging enemies!\");\n    SetMovementSpeed(2.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotLifecycle class and is intended to be overridden
    by custom bot implementations. It's called during the combat state transition,
    so any logic here should be lightweight to avoid performance degradation. The
    method does not provide access to combat context or target information directly;
    for such data, use other methods like GetTarget() or GetCombatState().
  warnings: Do not call this method manually unless implementing custom bot lifecycle
    management. Avoid heavy computations or blocking operations in this method as
    it may affect the bot's responsiveness during combat transitions.
