  class: PathGenerator
  method: CalculatePath
  signature: bool PathGenerator::CalculatePath(float destX, float destY, float destZ,
    bool forceDest)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a navigation path between two points in the game world for unit
    movement.
  description: The CalculatePath method computes a navigable route from a starting
    position to a destination position within the World of Warcraft environment. It
    utilizes TrinityCore's pathfinding system to determine valid waypoints that avoid
    obstacles and adhere to terrain constraints. The method supports both forced and
    standard destination handling, allowing for precise control over whether the final
    point must be exactly reached or if a nearby valid position is acceptable. This
    functionality is essential for AI-controlled creatures, player movement, and any
    entity requiring realistic path navigation in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: startX
    description: The X coordinate of the starting position in the game world
  - name: startY
    description: The Y coordinate of the starting position in the game world
  - name: startZ
    description: The Z coordinate (height) of the starting position in the game world
  - name: destX
    description: The X coordinate of the destination position in the game world
  - name: destY
    description: The Y coordinate of the destination position in the game world
  - name: destZ
    description: The Z coordinate (height) of the destination position in the game
      world
  - name: forceDest
    description: If true, forces the path to reach exactly at the destination point;
      if false, allows for a nearby valid point. This affects how obstacles are handled
      during path calculation.
  returns: Returns true if a valid path was successfully calculated and stored internally,
    false otherwise. A return value of false typically indicates that no navigable
    route exists between the start and destination points.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Calculation
    code: "PathGenerator pathGen;\nfloat startX = 100.0f, startY = 200.0f, startZ\
      \ = 50.0f;\nfloat destX = 300.0f, destY = 400.0f, destZ = 60.0f;\nbool success\
      \ = pathGen.CalculatePath(startX, startY, startZ, destX, destY, destZ, false);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Path has been calculated and is available for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Forced Destination Path Calculation
    code: "PathGenerator pathGen;\nfloat startX = 100.0f, startY = 200.0f, startZ\
      \ = 50.0f;\nfloat destX = 300.0f, destY = 400.0f, destZ = 60.0f;\nbool success\
      \ = pathGen.CalculatePath(startX, startY, startZ, destX, destY, destZ, true);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Path calculated with exact destination point enforced\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation mesh system and requires
    that both start and end positions are within valid navigable areas. The path is
    typically stored internally for subsequent retrieval via other methods like GetPath().
    Performance may vary depending on complexity of terrain and number of obstacles
    between points.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the input coordinates are within
    a valid navigable area may result in failure. Additionally, if forceDest is set
    to true, the method might fail even when a nearby valid path exists, as it strictly
    enforces exact destination positioning.
