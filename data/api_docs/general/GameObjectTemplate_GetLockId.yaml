documentation:
  brief: Returns the lock identifier associated with the game object template.
  description: The GetLockId method retrieves the lock ID that is defined for a specific
    game object template. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, game objects such as
    doors, chests, or other interactable entities can have locks associated with them.
    This lock ID typically references an entry in the `lock` database table which
    defines the mechanics of how the lock behaves, including what keys are required
    to unlock it, whether it's pickable, and other lock-specific properties. The returned
    value is used by the core game logic to determine if a player can interact with
    or open the object based on their key inventory or skill levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the lock ID associated with this game object
    template. If no lock is defined, the method may return 0, indicating that the
    object has no locking mechanism.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Lock ID for a Game Object Template
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(176542);\n\
      if (goTemplate)\n{\n    uint32 lockId = goTemplate->GetLockId();\n    if (lockId\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Process the lock\n        sLog->outString(\"Game\
      \ object has lock ID: %u\", lockId);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Game object is not locked.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during game object interaction checks, particularly
    when determining if a player can open or interact with a locked container or door.
    The lock ID returned should be validated against the Lock.dbc or corresponding
    database entries to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: "Ensure that the GameObjectTemplate pointer is valid before calling this\
    \ method; otherwise, it will result in undefined behavior. Also, note that a return\
    \ value of zero does not necessarily mean the object is unlocked\u2014it could\
    \ indicate no lock was defined for that template."
