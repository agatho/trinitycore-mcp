  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: ShouldDispel
  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::ShouldDispel(uint32 auraId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific aura should be dispelled by the coordinator.
  description: The ShouldDispel method evaluates if a given aura, identified by its
    unique ID, meets the criteria for removal through dispel mechanics. This method
    is typically used within the context of spell or aura management systems to control
    which effects can be removed via dispel spells or abilities. It checks against
    internal rules or configurations that define valid dispel conditions for each
    aura type. The result directly influences gameplay behavior such as whether a
    debuff can be cleansed by a priest's Abolish Disease or a paladin's Cleanse.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified aura should be eligible for dispelling, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the aura's properties allow it to be removed
    by dispel effects based on configured rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in dispel logic
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator->ShouldDispel(12345)) {\n    // Proceed with dispel\
      \ operation\n    target->RemoveAura(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal configuration tables or flags that
    define which auras are considered 'dispellable'. It may be called frequently during
    combat, so performance is important. The method should not be used outside of
    the context where dispel mechanics are active.
  warnings: Do not assume all auras can be dispelled; only those explicitly marked
    as such will return true. Misusing this method could lead to incorrect behavior
    in dispel interactions or unintended aura removals.
