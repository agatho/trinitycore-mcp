  class: GuildAchievementMgr
  method: SendPacket
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendPacket(const WorldPacket * data) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a WorldPacket to all guild members with appropriate permissions.
  description: The SendPacket method is responsible for broadcasting a WorldPacket
    to all players who are members of the guild and have the necessary permissions
    to receive the packet. This method is typically used for sending achievement-related
    data, guild notifications, or other real-time updates that require immediate client-side
    processing. The packet is transmitted through the player's connection using the
    standard TrinityCore networking infrastructure. The method operates on a const
    object, indicating it does not modify the GuildAchievementMgr state but rather
    uses it to determine which players should receive the packet.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A pointer to the WorldPacket that contains the data to be sent to
      guild members. This packet should be properly constructed with the appropriate
      opcode and payload for the intended recipient clients.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Achievement Data to Guild Members
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_GUILD_ACHIEVEMENT_DELETED, 4);

      packet << uint32(12345); // Achievement ID

      GuildAchievementMgr* mgr = guild->GetGuildAchievementMgr();

      mgr->SendPacket(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely iterates through all online guild members and sends the
    packet via their individual connection handlers. It may include filtering based
    on player permissions or achievement visibility settings. The method is designed
    to be efficient and avoid sending duplicate packets to the same client.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldPacket passed to this method is properly formatted
    with correct opcodes and data structure before calling SendPacket, as malformed
    packets can cause client-side crashes or unexpected behavior. Avoid calling this
    method from within a packet processing context to prevent potential deadlocks
    or recursive calls.
