documentation:
  brief: Retrieves account-specific data element value as either int64 or float.
  description: The GetDataElementAccount method fetches a specific account-level data
    element identified by its ID and returns it as a std::variant containing either
    an int64 or float value. This method is typically used to access player account
    configuration settings, statistics, or other persistent data that is stored per-account
    rather than per-character. The returned variant allows the caller to handle both
    integer and floating-point data types without requiring type checking at compile
    time. The method performs no direct database operations but relies on cached or
    pre-loaded account data within the PlayerDataAccessor instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::variant<int64, float> containing the requested account data element
    value. If the data element is stored as an integer, the int64 alternative will
    be active; if stored as a floating-point number, the float alternative will be
    active. The method returns a default-constructed variant if the data element ID
    is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerDataAccessor accessor;\n// Assuming account data element ID 12345\
      \ represents player's total login time\nauto result = accessor.GetDataElementAccount(12345);\n\
      if (std::holds_alternative<int64>(result)) {\n    int64 loginTime = std::get<int64>(result);\n\
      \    // Process integer value\n} else if (std::holds_alternative<float>(result))\
      \ {\n    float loginTime = std::get<float>(result);\n    // Process floating-point\
      \ value\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Account Configuration
    code: "PlayerDataAccessor* playerData = GetPlayerData();\nuint32 accountId = 98765;\n\
      // Retrieve account-specific setting like maximum character slots\nauto maxSlots\
      \ = playerData->GetDataElementAccount(accountId);\nif (std::holds_alternative<int64>(maxSlots))\
      \ {\n    int64 slotCount = std::get<int64>(maxSlots);\n    // Use the integer\
      \ value to determine available slots\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that account data elements are already loaded into memory
    or cached within the PlayerDataAccessor instance. It does not perform any database
    queries directly but may depend on pre-loaded data from a database or configuration
    source. The method is designed to be efficient and thread-safe for read operations,
    assuming proper synchronization of the underlying data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the dataElementId parameter corresponds to a valid account
    data element ID; invalid IDs may return default-constructed variants which could
    lead to unexpected behavior if not checked properly. Be cautious when using std::get()
    without checking the variant type first, as it can cause runtime exceptions if
    the wrong alternative is accessed.
