  class: RestStrategy
  method: NeedsDrink
  signature: bool RestStrategy::NeedsDrink(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot requires drinking based on its current energy
    and mana levels.
  description: The NeedsDrink method evaluates the bot's current state to determine
    if it needs to consume a drink to restore energy or mana. This method is typically
    used within the RestStrategy class to make decisions about when the bot should
    stop resting and seek out consumables. It checks the bot's energy and mana levels
    against predefined thresholds, considering the bot's current health status and
    the availability of drinks in its inventory. The method returns true if the bot's
    energy or mana falls below a certain percentage threshold, indicating that it
    should consume a drink to continue functioning effectively.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot's energy or mana levels are critically low and
    require drinking; otherwise returns false.

  - title: Basic Usage in Rest Strategy
    code: "if (strategy->NeedsDrink(ai)) {\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->Clear();\n\
      \    ai->GetBot()->SetOrientation(ai->GetBot()->GetOrientation() + M_PI);\n\
      \    // Proceed with drinking logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making process within TrinityCore's
    bot system. It relies on internal state tracking and may be influenced by the
    bot's current class, level, and equipped items. The thresholds for determining
    when a drink is needed are configurable but typically based on standard WoW gameplay
    mechanics.
