documentation:
  brief: Sets the choice identifier for a player choice dialog.
  description: The SetChoiceId method assigns a unique identifier to a PlayerChoiceData
    object, which represents a specific choice option within a player choice dialog.
    This identifier is used by the game engine to track and process the player's selection.
    The method typically updates internal state variables and may trigger associated
    events or callbacks. It is commonly called when initializing or modifying player
    choice options in quest systems or interactive dialogues.
  parameters:
  - name: choiceId
    description: The unique identifier for the player choice option. This value should
      correspond to a valid entry in the player choice database and typically maps
      to a specific dialogue option or quest reward.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Choice ID for a Player Choice Dialog
    code: 'PlayerChoiceData* choiceData = new PlayerChoiceData();

      choiceData->SetChoiceId(12345);

      // The choice data now represents choice option with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Choice ID During Quest Progression
    code: "void UpdatePlayerChoice(uint32 newChoiceId)\n{\n    PlayerChoiceData* currentChoice\
      \ = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerChoiceData(playerGuid);\n    if (currentChoice)\n\
      \    {\n        currentChoice->SetChoiceId(newChoiceId);\n        // Notify\
      \ client of updated choice\n        player->SendUpdateWorldState(WORLD_STATE_PLAYER_CHOICE_ID,\
      \ newChoiceId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the PlayerChoiceData object is in
    a valid state and not currently being processed by the game engine. Setting an
    invalid choice ID may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors during
    dialog rendering.
  warnings: Calling SetChoiceId with an invalid or non-existent choice ID can cause
    client disconnections or dialogue corruption. Ensure that the choiceId parameter
    corresponds to a valid entry in the player choice database before calling this
    method.
