  class: AreaTriggerCylinder
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void AreaTriggerCylinder::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const AreaTrigger
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes and writes area trigger cylinder data to a byte buffer for client
    synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state of an AreaTriggerCylinder
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for transmission to a specific player client.
    This method is typically invoked during the initial creation or update of area
    trigger visuals and effects for players in proximity to the trigger. It ensures
    that the client receives all necessary data to render the cylinder-shaped area
    trigger correctly, including its position, dimensions, and associated properties.
    The serialization process includes handling of the owner trigger reference and
    the target receiver player, ensuring proper network synchronization.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer object where serialized area trigger data will be
      written. This buffer is used to construct the packet sent to the client.
  - name: owner
    description: A pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this cylinder. This
      reference provides context about the trigger's properties and state.
  - name: receiver
    description: A pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized data.
      Used to determine what specific information should be included for that player's
      client.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Initialization
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      AreaTriggerCylinder cylinder;

      Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Get area trigger reference

      cylinder.WriteCreate(data, trigger, player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Area Trigger Update to Player
    code: "void SendAreaTriggerUpdate(Player* player, AreaTriggerCylinder* cylinder,\
      \ AreaTrigger* owner) {\n    ByteBuffer data;\n    cylinder->WriteCreate(data,\
      \ owner, player);\n    player->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's network synchronization system for
    area triggers. It should only be called when preparing data to send over the network
    to a client. The method assumes that all parameters are valid and not null, as
    it does not perform null checks.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of the ByteBuffer may result in malformed packets or client-side
    errors. Ensure that the 'data' buffer is properly initialized before calling this
    method. Also, be cautious about calling this method on triggers that have not
    been fully initialized or configured.
