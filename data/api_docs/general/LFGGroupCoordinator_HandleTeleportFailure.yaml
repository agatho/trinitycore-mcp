  class: LFGGroupCoordinator
  method: HandleTeleportFailure
  signature: void LFGGroupCoordinator::HandleTeleportFailure(Player * player, const
    std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Handles teleportation failure for a player in a LFG group by sending an appropriate
    error message.
  description: The HandleTeleportFailure method is responsible for managing teleportation
    failures within the Looking For Group (LFG) system. When a player experiences
    a teleportation issue during a group activity, this method is invoked to notify
    the player of the failure and provide a reason for why the teleport failed. It
    ensures that the player receives appropriate feedback and can take corrective
    actions or rejoin the group as needed. The method operates within the LFGGroupCoordinator
    context, which manages group coordination and communication during LFG activities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object that experienced the teleportation failure.
      This parameter identifies which player needs to be notified about the teleportation
      issue.
  - name: reason
    description: String containing the reason for the teleportation failure. This
      message is sent to the player to explain why the teleport failed, such as 'Instance
      is full' or 'Player is in combat'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Get player reference

      std::string failureReason = "Instance is currently full";

      coordinator.HandleTeleportFailure(targetPlayer, failureReason);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Reason
    code: "LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator;\nPlayer* player = ...; // Get player reference\n\
      std::string reason = \"Player is in combat\";\nif (player->IsInCombat())\n{\n\
      \    coordinator.HandleTeleportFailure(player, reason);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LFG system when a teleportation
    attempt fails. It's important to note that this method does not attempt to retry
    or resolve the teleportation issue itself, but rather communicates the failure
    back to the player. The method assumes that the player object and reason string
    are valid and properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid potential crashes. Also, be cautious about the content of the reason string
    as it will be directly sent to the client without additional sanitization.
