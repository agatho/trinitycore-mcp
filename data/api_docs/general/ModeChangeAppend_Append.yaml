  method: Append
  signature: void ModeChangeAppend::Append(WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify &
    data) const
documentation:
  brief: Appends channel notification data to the provided packet structure for transmission
    to clients.
  description: The ModeChangeAppend::Append method is responsible for adding channel-related
    notification data into a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet. This method
    is typically used during channel mode changes, such as when a user's permissions
    or status within a channel are modified. It ensures that the appropriate notification
    information is included in the packet before it is sent to affected clients. The
    method operates on a const object and modifies the provided packet reference in-place,
    making it suitable for use in scenarios where channel state updates need to be
    broadcasted across the network.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify packet that will
      be populated with channel notification data. This parameter is modified in-place
      by the method.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ModeChangeAppend append;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      append.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be used in the context of TrinityCore's channel
    system, where it helps maintain synchronization of channel states across multiple
    clients. It assumes that the provided packet object has been properly initialized
    and is ready to receive data.
