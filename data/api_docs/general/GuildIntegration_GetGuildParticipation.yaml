api:
  class: GuildIntegration
  method: GetGuildParticipation
  signature: GuildParticipation GuildIntegration::GetGuildParticipation(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the guild participation status for a specified player GUID.
  description: The GetGuildParticipation method fetches the current guild participation
    data associated with a given player's unique identifier (GUID). This data typically
    includes information about whether the player is currently part of a guild, their
    role within the guild, and other related membership details. The method serves
    as a core utility for retrieving player guild-related state in TrinityCore's framework,
    enabling systems to determine a player's guild involvement without requiring additional
    database queries or complex logic.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose guild participation
      status is being retrieved. This value must correspond to an existing player
      in the database, otherwise the method may return default or invalid participation
      data.
  returns: A GuildParticipation object containing the player's current guild membership
    details such as guild ID, rank, join date, and other relevant metadata. If no
    guild participation is found for the specified player, a default or empty GuildParticipation
    structure may be returned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nGuildParticipation participation = guildIntegration.GetGuildParticipation(playerId);\n\
      if (participation.GuildId != 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player is in guild: \"\
      \ << participation.GuildId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Guild Rank
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nGuildParticipation participation = guildIntegration.GetGuildParticipation(playerId);\n\
      if (participation.Rank == GUILD_RANK_OFFICER)\n{\n    // Grant officer-only\
      \ permissions\n    std::cout << \"Player is an officer\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses cached data or performs a database lookup depending
    on the implementation. It should be used judiciously in performance-critical sections
    of code, especially when called frequently for multiple players. The returned
    GuildParticipation object may not reflect real-time changes if caching is enabled.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID might
    result in undefined behavior or incorrect data being returned. Ensure that the
    player GUID corresponds to a valid character before invoking this method.
