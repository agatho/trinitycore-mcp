  class: Unit
  method: IsInSanctuary
  signature: bool Unit::IsInSanctuary() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently within a sanctuary area.
  description: This method checks if the unit is located within a designated sanctuary
    zone, which typically represents areas where player versus player combat is disabled
    and players cannot be attacked by other players. The method returns true when
    the unit's current position is inside such a zone, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for determining safe zones in World of Warcraft gameplay mechanics,
    particularly for preventing PvP interactions and ensuring player safety during
    combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently within a sanctuary area, false otherwise.
    The method may return false if the unit is not in any sanctuary zone or if the
    sanctuary zone detection logic fails due to position calculation issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->IsInSanctuary()) {\n    // Perform actions that require safe\
      \ zone\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation relies on the unit's current position and map data to determine
    sanctuary status. Performance considerations include checking map coordinates
    against sanctuary boundaries, which may be computationally intensive in certain
    scenarios.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole indicator for determining player
    safety, as it only checks for sanctuary zones and does not account for other safety
    mechanisms such as PvP flags or combat state.
