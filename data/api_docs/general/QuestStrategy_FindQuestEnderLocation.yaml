  class: QuestStrategy
  method: FindQuestEnderLocation
  signature: bool QuestStrategy::FindQuestEnderLocation(BotAI * ai, uint32 questId,
    QuestEnderLocation & location)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the location of a quest ender for the specified quest ID.
  description: The FindQuestEnderLocation method searches for and retrieves the geographic
    coordinates and map information where a quest ender (such as an NPC or object)
    is located for a given quest. This method is typically used by AI systems to determine
    where a player should go to complete a quest. It requires a valid BotAI instance
    and a valid quest ID. The method populates the provided QuestEnderLocation structure
    with the relevant data if successful, otherwise it returns false. The location
    information includes coordinates (x, y, z) and the map ID where the quest ender
    can be found.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that manages the bot's behavior and
      AI logic.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest for which to find the ender location.
      Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: location
    description: Reference to a QuestEnderLocation structure that will be populated
      with the found coordinates and map information if the method succeeds.
  returns: Returns true if a valid quest ender location was found for the specified
    quest ID; otherwise, returns false. This typically occurs when the quest does
    not exist or has no defined ender location in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find quest ender location
    code: "QuestEnderLocation loc;\nif (strategy->FindQuestEnderLocation(ai, 12345,\
      \ loc)) {\n    // Use loc.x, loc.y, loc.z, and loc.mapId\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found quest ender at (%f, %f, %f) on map %u\", \n                    loc.x,\
      \ loc.y, loc.z, loc.mapId);\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"Could not find\
      \ quest ender for quest ID 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and database lookups.
    It may be computationally expensive if called frequently or with many quests.
    The QuestEnderLocation structure is expected to be properly initialized before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Also, verify that the questId corresponds to an actual quest in the game
    database; otherwise, the method will return false without populating the location
    structure.
