  class: LootCoordination
  method: CacheCoordinationData
  signature: void LootCoordination::CacheCoordinationData(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Caches loot coordination data for all members of a group.
  description: The CacheCoordinationData method prepares and stores loot coordination
    information for all players within the specified group. This includes gathering
    relevant loot-related data such as item eligibility, player roles, and loot distribution
    preferences. The cached data is typically used during loot rolling or loot assignment
    processes to ensure fair and efficient distribution among group members. This
    method is essential for maintaining proper loot coordination state when dealing
    with group loot systems in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the members whose loot coordination
      data will be cached. Must not be null and must represent a valid group with
      active members.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Caching Loot Coordination for a Group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    LootCoordination\
      \ lootCoord;\n    lootCoord.CacheCoordinationData(myGroup);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a group's loot coordination state needs
    to be refreshed or initialized. It is typically invoked when a new group is formed,
    when players join/leave the group, or before starting a loot roll. The caching
    mechanism helps avoid repeated calculations during loot distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null;
    otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This method modifies internal state and
    should only be called in appropriate contexts where loot coordination is actively
    being managed.
