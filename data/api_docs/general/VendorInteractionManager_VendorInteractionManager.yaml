  class: VendorInteractionManager
  method: VendorInteractionManager
  signature: void VendorInteractionManager::VendorInteractionManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a VendorInteractionManager instance for the specified player
    bot.
  description: The VendorInteractionManager constructor initializes the manager with
    a reference to a Player object, typically representing a bot in the game. This
    setup allows the manager to handle vendor-related interactions such as buying
    and selling items on behalf of the bot. The method prepares internal data structures
    and state necessary for vendor operations within the TrinityCore framework. It
    is expected that the Player parameter points to a valid bot instance with appropriate
    permissions and resources.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with vendors. Must not be null and should represent an active bot character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic VendorInteractionManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot

      VendorInteractionManager vendorManager(myBot);

      // The manager is now initialized and ready for vendor interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any network communication or immediate
    vendor queries. It simply sets up the internal state of the manager. The actual
    vendor interaction logic may be triggered by other methods like BuyItem() or SellItem().
    Ensure that the Player object passed is valid and represents a bot character,
    as using a regular player character may lead to unexpected behavior.
