  class: RoleAssignment
  method: BuildPlayerProfile
  signature: void RoleAssignment::BuildPlayerProfile(PlayerRoleProfile & profile,
    Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Populates a PlayerRoleProfile object with data from the specified player
    character.
  description: The BuildPlayerProfile method is responsible for gathering and assembling
    role-related information about a given player character into a structured PlayerRoleProfile
    object. This method likely extracts various attributes such as class, specialization,
    gear level, achievements, and other relevant gameplay statistics that define a
    player's role within the World of Warcraft environment. It serves as a core utility
    for systems that require comprehensive player profile data for role assignment,
    team composition analysis, or character management purposes. The method operates
    on the provided Player object and fills the profile parameter with appropriate
    values without returning any result.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to a PlayerRoleProfile object that will be populated with
      player data. This object must be valid and properly initialized before calling
      the method.
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object from which profile information is extracted.
      Must not be null; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Building
    code: 'PlayerRoleProfile myProfile;

      Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      RoleAssignment roleAssign;

      roleAssign.BuildPlayerProfile(myProfile, targetPlayer);

      // myProfile now contains all relevant role data for targetPlayer'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Role Assignment Logic
    code: "void AssignRoleToPlayer(Player* player)\n{\n    PlayerRoleProfile profile;\n\
      \    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.BuildPlayerProfile(profile,\
      \ player);\n    \n    // Use profile data to determine appropriate role\n  \
      \  if (profile.GetSpecialization() == SPEC_WARLOCK)\n        player->SetRole(ROLE_TANK);\n\
      \    else if (profile.GetGearScore() > 800)\n        player->SetRole(ROLE_DPS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player login, role re-evaluation,
    or when building dynamic team compositions. It assumes that the Player object
    passed has valid data and is fully initialized. The implementation may involve
    multiple internal calls to retrieve different aspects of a player's profile, so
    performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is valid and not in an intermediate
    state before calling this method. Also, note that the profile object may be overwritten
    completely, so any existing data should be preserved if needed.
