  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetRoleAssignment
  signature: const RoleAssignment & AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetRoleAssignment() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current role assignment for the adaptive behavior manager.
  description: The GetRoleAssignment method returns a constant reference to the RoleAssignment
    object that represents the current role assigned to this adaptive behavior manager.
    This role assignment determines how the AI behavior should adapt and respond in
    various game scenarios, such as combat or non-combat situations. The returned
    RoleAssignment object contains information about the assigned role, which may
    influence decision-making processes within the AI system. This method is typically
    used by other components of the AI system to understand the current behavioral
    context and adjust their actions accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a RoleAssignment object that defines the current
    role assignment for this adaptive behavior manager. The object contains role-specific
    data that influences AI decision-making.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "const RoleAssignment& role = behaviorManager.GetRoleAssignment();\nif (role.GetRoleType()\
      \ == ROLE_TANK)\n{\n    // Perform tank-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Role Properties
    code: 'const RoleAssignment& assignment = manager.GetRoleAssignment();

      uint32 roleId = assignment.GetRoleId();

      std::string roleName = assignment.GetRoleName();

      // Use role data to customize AI behavior

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state. The returned
    reference remains valid as long as the AdaptiveBehaviorManager instance exists.
    The RoleAssignment object should not be modified through this reference as it
    may affect the AI behavior.
  warnings: Do not store the returned reference beyond the lifetime of the AdaptiveBehaviorManager
    instance, as it may become invalid. Be aware that modifying the RoleAssignment
    through other means might affect the behavior of this method's return value.
