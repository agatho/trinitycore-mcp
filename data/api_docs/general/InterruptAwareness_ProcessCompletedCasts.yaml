  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: ProcessCompletedCasts
  signature: void InterruptAwareness::ProcessCompletedCasts(SpellScanResult & result)
documentation:
  brief: Processes completed spell casts to determine interrupt awareness status for
    affected units.
  description: The ProcessCompletedCasts method evaluates the results of a spell scan
    operation to identify which units have had their spell casts interrupted or completed.
    This method is typically used within the context of AI behavior systems to update
    unit states based on spell completion events. It analyzes the SpellScanResult
    structure for completed casts and applies appropriate interrupt awareness logic,
    potentially updating unit target information, threat levels, or AI decision-making
    states. The method operates as part of a larger spell awareness system that monitors
    combat events and adjusts NPC behavior accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: Reference to a SpellScanResult structure containing the results of
      a spell scan operation. This structure holds information about completed casts,
      affected targets, and spell status that determines interrupt awareness conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void ExampleAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    SpellScanResult result;\n\
      \    // ... populate spell scan result ...\n    interruptAwareness.ProcessCompletedCasts(result);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat event handling
    code: "void CombatHandler::OnSpellCastComplete(Spell* spell)\n{\n    SpellScanResult\
      \ result;\n    // ... populate result based on spell completion ...\n    interruptAwareness.ProcessCompletedCasts(result);\n\
      \    // ... continue with other combat logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called after spell scanning operations and
    should only be invoked when valid SpellScanResult data is available. The method
    modifies internal state based on completed cast information, so it's important
    that the input result accurately reflects the current combat situation. Performance
    considerations include avoiding frequent calls during high-frequency AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the SpellScanResult parameter contains valid and up-to-date
    data before calling this method. Passing stale or incomplete scan results may
    lead to incorrect interrupt awareness states being applied to units.
