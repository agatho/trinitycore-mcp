documentation:
  brief: Sends a packet to all players currently engaged in the battlefield.
  description: The BroadcastPacketToWar method broadcasts a specified WorldPacket
    to all players who are actively participating in the battlefield. This function
    is typically used to send synchronized updates, such as objective changes, player
    actions, or game state modifications that need to be visible to all participants
    in real-time. The method ensures that the packet is delivered to every player
    within the battlefield's context without requiring individual targeting. It operates
    under the assumption that the Battlefield instance has an active list of participating
    players and that the provided packet data is properly formatted for transmission.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Broadcasting a Custom Packet to All Battlefield Players
    code: 'WorldPacket packet(SMSG_UPDATE_WORLD_STATE, 8);

      packet << uint32(1234); // World state ID

      packet << uint32(5678); // Value

      currentBattlefield->BroadcastPacketToWar(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal player tracking mechanisms to determine
    which players are currently in the battlefield. It may internally call other utility
    functions to iterate through active players and send the packet individually to
    each one, or it might leverage a more optimized broadcast mechanism specific to
    TrinityCore's networking layer.
  warnings: Ensure that the WorldPacket passed to this method is properly constructed
    before calling this function, as malformed packets can cause client-side issues
    or disconnections. Also, be cautious about performance when broadcasting large
    packets frequently during high-activity periods in battlefields.
