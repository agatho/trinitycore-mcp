  class: LfgCompatibilityData
  method: LfgCompatibilityData
  signature: void LfgCompatibilityData::LfgCompatibilityData(LfgCompatibility _compatibility,
    const LfgRolesMap & _roles)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new LfgCompatibilityData object with specified compatibility
    and roles.
  description: The LfgCompatibilityData constructor initializes a new instance of
    the LfgCompatibilityData class, setting its internal compatibility status and
    role mappings. This class is used within TrinityCore's Looking for Group (LFG)
    system to track player compatibility for group formations. The constructor accepts
    a LfgCompatibility enum value that defines the overall compatibility state and
    a reference to a LfgRolesMap which contains detailed role information for each
    player involved in the compatibility check.
  parameters:
  - name: _compatibility
    description: The LfgCompatibility enum value indicating the overall compatibility
      status between players or groups. Valid values typically include LFG_COMPATIBILITY_SAME,
      LFG_COMPATIBILITY_DIFFERENT, LFG_COMPATIBILITY_INCOMPATIBLE, etc., depending
      on the specific implementation.
  - name: _roles
    description: A constant reference to a LfgRolesMap containing role assignments
      for players. This map typically stores role information such as tank, healer,
      or damage dealer assignments that affect group compatibility calculations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'LfgCompatibilityData data(LFG_COMPATIBILITY_SAME, rolesMap);

      // Initializes a new LfgCompatibilityData object with same compatibility and
      provided role map'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Different Compatibility
    code: 'LfgRolesMap myRoles;

      myRoles[PLAYER_ROLE_TANK] = true;

      myRoles[PLAYER_ROLE_HEALER] = false;

      LfgCompatibilityData data(LFG_COMPATIBILITY_DIFFERENT, myRoles);

      // Creates a compatibility data object indicating different roles but with specific
      role assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the LFG system when creating
    compatibility records for group matching. The LfgRolesMap parameter should be
    properly initialized before calling this constructor to avoid undefined behavior.
    The class may also perform internal validation of the provided parameters.
  warnings: Ensure that the LfgRolesMap passed to this constructor contains valid
    role data, as invalid or uninitialized role mappings can lead to incorrect compatibility
    calculations in the LFG system. This constructor does not validate the _compatibility
    enum value, so invalid values might cause unexpected behavior.
