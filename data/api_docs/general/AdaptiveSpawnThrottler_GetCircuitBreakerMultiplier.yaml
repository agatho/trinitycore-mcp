  method: GetCircuitBreakerMultiplier
  signature: float AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::GetCircuitBreakerMultiplier() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current circuit breaker multiplier used for adaptive spawn throttling
    in the game world.
  description: The GetCircuitBreakerMultiplier method retrieves a floating-point value
    that represents the current multiplier applied to spawn throttling logic within
    the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class. This multiplier is typically used to dynamically
    adjust the rate at which creatures or game objects are spawned based on system
    load, player activity, or other environmental factors. The returned value can
    be less than 1.0 to reduce spawning rates, or greater than 1.0 to increase them,
    depending on the internal logic of the throttler. This method is part of the adaptive
    spawn management system that helps maintain server performance and stability by
    preventing excessive resource consumption during high-traffic periods.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current circuit breaker multiplier. Values
    less than 1.0 indicate reduced spawning rates, while values greater than 1.0 indicate
    increased spawning rates. The exact range and interpretation depend on the implementation
    details of the AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      float multiplier = throttler.GetCircuitBreakerMultiplier();

      printf("Current spawn multiplier: %.2f\n", multiplier);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Multiplier for Spawn Logic
    code: "AdaptiveSpawnThrottler* throttler = sWorld->GetAdaptiveSpawnThrottler();\n\
      float multiplier = throttler->GetCircuitBreakerMultiplier();\nif (multiplier\
      \ < 0.5f)\n{\n    // Reduce spawn rate significantly\n    // Apply logic to\
      \ limit creature spawns\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during server tick processing
    and should be optimized for performance. The returned value may change dynamically
    based on real-time server conditions such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or
    concurrent player count.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned multiplier directly; it's a read-only accessor.
    Modifying this value externally could lead to inconsistent spawn behavior or unexpected
    system performance issues.
