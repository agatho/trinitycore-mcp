documentation:
  brief: Retrieves creature model information for the specified model ID
  description: This method fetches the creature model info associated with a given
    model ID from the object manager's internal data structures. It is commonly used
    to access properties of creature models such as display statistics, bounding box
    dimensions, or other model-specific attributes. The returned pointer points to
    an internal structure that should not be modified directly. If no model information
    exists for the provided ID, the method returns a null pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer array containing creature model data, or
    nullptr if no model info is found for the given model ID
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve model info
    code: "const int* modelInfo = sObjectMgr->GetCreatureModelInfo(12345);\nif (modelInfo\
      \ != nullptr) {\n    // Use modelInfo[0], modelInfo[1], etc.\n    printf(\"\
      Model info retrieved: %d, %d\\n\", modelInfo[0], modelInfo[1]);\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"No model info found for ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned data is managed internally by the ObjectMgr and should not be
    freed or modified. This method performs a lookup in an internal map structure,
    so performance is generally good for frequent lookups but may vary depending on
    map size.
  warnings: Ensure that the modelId passed to this function is valid and corresponds
    to an existing creature model in the database; otherwise, it will return nullptr.
    Do not attempt to modify the returned data as it's part of internal state.
