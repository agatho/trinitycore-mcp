  class: CooldownEvent
  method: SpellCooldownStart
  signature: CooldownEvent CooldownEvent::SpellCooldownStart(int caster, uint32 spellId,
    uint32 cooldownMs)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns a new CooldownEvent object for a spell cooldown start.
  description: The SpellCooldownStart method creates and returns a new CooldownEvent
    instance that represents the beginning of a spell cooldown period. This method
    is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to manage spell cooldowns,
    ensuring that spells cannot be cast again until their cooldown timer expires.
    The returned CooldownEvent object can then be processed by the game's event system
    or stored for later reference. This method requires valid caster and spell identifiers
    along with a cooldown duration in milliseconds.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player or creature casting the
      spell. Must be a valid object GUID.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast. Must correspond to
      a valid spell in the game database.
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The cooldown duration in milliseconds. Must be a positive integer
      representing the time before the spell can be cast again.
  returns: A new CooldownEvent object initialized with the provided caster, spell
    ID, and cooldown duration. This object represents the start of the spell's cooldown
    period.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cooldown Start
    code: CooldownEvent event = CooldownEvent::SpellCooldownStart(playerGuid, 12345,
      3000);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Creature Casting
    code: 'uint32 cooldown = 5000;

      Creature* creature = ...;

      CooldownEvent event = CooldownEvent::SpellCooldownStart(creature->GetGUID().GetCounter(),
      67890, cooldown);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's event handling system for managing
    spell cooldowns. The returned CooldownEvent should be properly registered with
    the game's event manager to ensure correct timing and execution. The cooldown
    duration is typically derived from the spell's database entry, but can also be
    modified by effects or auras.
  warnings: Ensure that the caster GUID is valid before calling this method, as invalid
    GUIDs may cause undefined behavior. The spell ID must exist in the spell database;
    otherwise, the event may not function correctly. Be cautious when using large
    cooldown values as they might impact performance if many events are created simultaneously.
