documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AreaInfo object with default values.
  description: The AreaInfo constructor initializes a new instance of the AreaInfo
    class, setting up internal data structures and default property values. This method
    is typically called when creating a new area information object to represent a
    specific zone or region within the game world. The constructor ensures that all
    member variables are properly initialized before the object can be used for area-related
    operations such as zone identification, area flags, and related gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new AreaInfo instance
    code: 'AreaInfo area;

      // The area object is now initialized with default values

      // and can be used for area-related operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or database
    lookups. It simply sets up the basic structure of the AreaInfo object. Any actual
    area data would typically be loaded through other methods or constructors that
    accept area identifiers.
