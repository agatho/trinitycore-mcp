  signature: void MonkAI::ManageBrewCharges()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the brewing charges for a monk AI, handling consumption and replenishment
    of brew effects.
  description: The ManageBrewCharges method is responsible for controlling the brew
    charges within the MonkAI system. It evaluates the current state of the monk's
    brew effects, determines when charges should be consumed or replenished, and updates
    the internal charge counter accordingly. This method ensures proper resource management
    for brew-based abilities such as Brew of the Crane or other brew-related mechanics
    in the game. The function typically runs during AI update cycles to maintain consistent
    charge levels and prevent overuse of brew effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    ManageBrewCharges();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the monk's aura system and charge tracking
    mechanisms. It may be called frequently during AI update cycles, so performance
    optimization is important. The implementation probably checks for active brew
    auras and adjusts charges based on game rules.
  warnings: Improper handling of brew charges could lead to incorrect behavior in
    brew-based abilities. Ensure this method is called regularly in the AI update
    loop to maintain proper charge state.
