  signature: void BotMemoryManager::PerformMemoryMaintenance()
documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and optimization of bot memory resources to prevent memory
    leaks and maintain performance.
  description: The PerformMemoryMaintenance method is responsible for managing and
    optimizing the memory usage of AI bots within the TrinityCore environment. This
    method typically handles tasks such as freeing unused memory blocks, clearing
    stale data structures, and performing garbage collection on bot-related objects.
    It ensures that bot memory consumption remains efficient over time and prevents
    potential memory leaks that could degrade server performance. The method is usually
    invoked periodically by the game engine or manually during specific maintenance
    operations.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotMemoryManager::instance()->PerformMemoryMaintenance();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly to maintain optimal performance. It's
    typically invoked by the server's maintenance loop or triggered manually during
    high-load periods. The implementation may vary depending on the specific bot AI
    system being used.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause performance overhead. It
    should only be executed when necessary, such as during scheduled maintenance windows
    or when memory usage exceeds certain thresholds.
