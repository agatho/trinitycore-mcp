  class: DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid
  method: GetAreaTriggersInArea
  signature: int DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetAreaTriggersInArea(const int & center,
    float radius)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of area triggers within a specified radius of a given
    center point.
  description: The GetAreaTriggersInArea method queries the spatial grid system to
    determine how many area trigger objects are located within a circular area defined
    by a center point and radius. This functionality is essential for handling player
    interactions with zone-based events, such as entering or leaving areas that activate
    specific game mechanics like quest triggers, combat zones, or environmental effects.
    The method leverages the double-buffered spatial grid structure to efficiently
    manage and query objects in a dynamic world environment. It's commonly used during
    player movement updates or event activation checks where proximity-based logic
    is required.
  parameters:
  - name: center
    description: The center point of the area to search, represented as an integer
      identifier (likely a grid cell index or spatial coordinate). This parameter
      defines the origin from which the radius is measured.
  - name: radius
    description: The radius of the circular area in which to search for area triggers.
      Must be a positive floating-point value representing the distance from the center
      point.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of area triggers found within
    the specified radius around the given center point. A return value of zero indicates
    no area triggers were found in the area.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int triggerCount = grid.GetAreaTriggersInArea(12345, 10.0f);\nif (triggerCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Process area triggers\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << triggerCount\
      \ << \" area triggers.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Triggers in Player Proximity
    code: "float playerRadius = 5.0f;\nint nearbyTriggers = grid.GetAreaTriggersInArea(playerGridPosition,\
      \ playerRadius);\nif (nearbyTriggers > 0) {\n    // Activate proximity-based\
      \ events\n    HandlePlayerProximityEvent();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on a double-buffered spatial grid system, which means
    it may use a snapshot of the current state for querying. The center parameter
    should be validated to ensure it represents a valid spatial location within the
    grid boundaries. Performance is optimized through spatial partitioning, but large
    radius values may impact query speed if many triggers are present in the area.
  warnings: Ensure that the center parameter corresponds to a valid grid cell or coordinate
    system used by the spatial grid. Using invalid coordinates can lead to undefined
    behavior or incorrect results. The method does not return actual trigger objects;
    it only provides a count, so additional queries may be needed to retrieve specific
    trigger data.
