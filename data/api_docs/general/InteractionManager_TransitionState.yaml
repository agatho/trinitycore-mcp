  method: TransitionState
  signature: void InteractionManager::TransitionState(Player * bot, InteractionState
    newState)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions a bot player to a new interaction state within the interaction
    manager system.
  description: The TransitionState method facilitates changing the current interaction
    state of a specified bot player. This method is typically used in automated AI
    systems to manage how bots behave during different stages of interaction, such
    as idle, combat, trading, or quest progression. The transition may involve updating
    internal state tracking, triggering relevant callbacks, and potentially modifying
    the bot's behavior patterns or actions based on the new state. It ensures that
    the player's interaction context is properly updated for subsequent processing
    by the interaction manager.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose interaction
      state will be transitioned. Must not be null.
  - name: newState
    description: The target InteractionState enum value that the bot should transition
      into. Defines the new behavioral context for the bot's interactions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      InteractionState nextState = INTERACTION_STATE_COMBAT;

      interactionManager->TransitionState(myBot, nextState);'
    language: cpp
  - title: State Transition with Conditional Logic
    code: "if (player->GetHealthPercent() < 30)\n{\n    interactionManager->TransitionState(bot,\
      \ INTERACTION_STATE_RETREAT);\n}\nelse\n{\n    interactionManager->TransitionState(bot,\
      \ INTERACTION_STATE_COMBAT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid Player objects that are managed
    by the InteractionManager. The internal state tracking of the bot must be properly
    initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling TransitionState with an invalid or uninitialized Player pointer
    will result in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure all preconditions are met
    before invoking this method.
