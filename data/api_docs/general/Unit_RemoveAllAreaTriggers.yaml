documentation:
  brief: Removes all area triggers from the unit
  description: This method removes all active area trigger effects from the Unit,
    clearing any ongoing area trigger spells or effects that may be applied to the
    unit. It is typically used during combat or when transitioning between different
    game states to ensure clean removal of area trigger effects. The method accepts
    an AreaTriggerRemoveReason parameter which determines why the triggers are being
    removed, such as for combat termination, spell cancellation, or other game state
    changes.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: The reason for removing area triggers, indicating why they are being
      cleared. This can be used to determine specific behavior during removal, such
      as combat termination, spell cancellation, or other game state transitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->RemoveAllAreaTriggers(AreaTriggerRemoveReason::Combat);

      // Removes all area triggers due to combat termination'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = player;

      unit->RemoveAllAreaTriggers(AreaTriggerRemoveReason::SpellCancel);

      // Removes all area triggers due to spell cancellation

      // This is typically used in conjunction with other methods like RemoveAura
      or RemoveAllAuras'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by TrinityCore during game state
    transitions and combat handling. It's important to note that this method does
    not directly remove any aura effects, but rather clears area triggers specifically.
    The method may be called multiple times per frame depending on the game state.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where you need to preserve
    specific area trigger effects. It is designed for clearing all area triggers and
    may result in loss of game state information if used incorrectly.
