  brief: Moves the SystemMgr object, transferring ownership of its resources to the
    target object.
  description: The move assignment operator for the SystemMgr class transfers all
    resources from the source SystemMgr object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used when assigning one SystemMgr instance to another, effectively
    transferring ownership of internal data structures and resources without performing
    a deep copy. The source object becomes invalid after the move operation and should
    not be used. This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for
    efficient resource management in TrinityCore's system management framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current SystemMgr object after the move assignment has
    been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'SystemMgr manager1;

      // ... initialize manager1 ...

      SystemMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move-assigns manager1 to manager2

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'SystemMgr mgr1, mgr2, mgr3;

      // ... initialize managers ...

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr2) = std::move(mgr3); // Chained move assignments

      // mgr2 and mgr3 are now in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework for
    efficient resource management. The moved-from object must not be accessed after
    the operation, as its state becomes undefined. This implementation follows standard
    C++ move semantics and is optimized for performance in server-side game logic.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source SystemMgr object should not be
    used or accessed as it will be left in a valid but unspecified state. Attempting
    to use the moved-from object may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
