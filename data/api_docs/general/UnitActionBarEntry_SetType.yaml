  class: UnitActionBarEntry
  method: SetType
  signature: void UnitActionBarEntry::SetType(ActiveStates type)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the active state type for a unit's action bar entry.
  description: The SetType method configures the active state type of a UnitActionBarEntry,
    determining how the action bar entry behaves within the game's UI and interaction
    system. This method is typically used to manage the visibility and functionality
    of action bar slots based on the current state of the unit, such as whether it's
    in combat, resting, or performing specific actions. The ActiveStates parameter
    defines the behavioral mode for the action bar entry, which can affect how spells,
    abilities, or items are displayed or activated.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The ActiveStates enum value that specifies the active state type
      for this action bar entry. Valid values include states such as ACTIVE, DISABLED,
      or HIDDEN depending on the implementation and game context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Action Bar Entry to Active State
    code: 'UnitActionBarEntry* entry = player->GetActionBarEntry(0);

      entry->SetType(ACTIVE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling an Action Bar Entry Based on Game State
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    UnitActionBarEntry* entry = player->GetActionBarEntry(3);\n\
      \    entry->SetType(DISABLED);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the visual and functional state of an action
    bar slot. It should be called carefully to ensure proper synchronization with
    game logic, especially when transitioning between different player states like
    combat or resting.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of SetType may lead to inconsistent UI behavior or unexpected
    interactions with spells and abilities. Ensure that the ActiveStates enum value
    passed is valid for the current context to avoid undefined behavior.
