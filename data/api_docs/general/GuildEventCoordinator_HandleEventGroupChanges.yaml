documentation:
  brief: Processes changes to guild event groups and updates associated event data
  description: The HandleEventGroupChanges method is responsible for managing modifications
    to guild event groups within the TrinityCore framework. This function takes a
    pointer to an integer group identifier and a unique event ID, then processes any
    necessary updates or synchronization required when event group membership changes.
    The method likely handles internal state management, notifications to connected
    clients, and ensures consistency between the guild's event scheduling system and
    the updated group configurations. It serves as a core component in maintaining
    accurate event coordination for guild activities such as raids, social events,
    or other organized gatherings within World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the group identifier that has
      undergone changes. This value may be modified during processing to reflect updated
      group assignments or states.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier for the specific guild event being modified. This
      ID is used to locate and update the corresponding event record in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int currentGroup = 5;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.HandleEventGroupChanges(&currentGroup, 12345);

      // Processes changes to group 5 for event ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Group Update
    code: 'int groupAssignment = 0;

      uint32 eventId = 98765;

      GuildEventCoordinator* coordinator = sGuildEventCoordinator;

      coordinator->HandleEventGroupChanges(&groupAssignment, eventId);

      // Updates event group assignment and synchronizes with guild event system'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a guild member's group membership changes
    during event planning or when events are reorganized. The function may trigger
    additional internal operations such as sending update packets to players, recalculating
    event availability, or updating database records. Developers should ensure that
    the group parameter points to a valid memory location and that eventId corresponds
    to an existing event in the guild system.
  warnings: Care must be taken when modifying the group value through the pointer
    parameter, as changes may affect downstream processing logic. This method should
    not be called with invalid or uninitialized eventId values, which could lead to
    undefined behavior or database corruption.
