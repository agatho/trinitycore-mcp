  method: InitVisibilityDistance
  signature: void Map::InitVisibilityDistance()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the visibility distance settings for the map.
  description: The InitVisibilityDistance method sets up the initial visibility distances
    for the map, determining how far players can see in different directions and under
    various conditions. This method is typically called during map initialization
    to configure the default visibility parameters that affect player field of view,
    object detection, and overall visual experience within the game world. It establishes
    base values for visibility ranges that may be adjusted later based on player state,
    environment, or game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Initialization
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      map->InitVisibilityDistance();

      // Visibility distances are now initialized for the map'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during map initialization. It's typically
    invoked internally by the core engine when a new map instance is created, and
    calling it multiple times may lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks. The
    visibility distances initialized here form the foundation for all subsequent visibility
    calculations in the map.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the map has been actively used or populated
    with players/objects, as it may disrupt existing visibility calculations and cause
    visual glitches or performance issues. This method is part of the internal initialization
    process and should generally not be called directly by custom modules unless you
    understand the full implications.
