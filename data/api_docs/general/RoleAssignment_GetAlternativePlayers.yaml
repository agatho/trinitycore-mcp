api:
  class: RoleAssignment
  method: GetAlternativePlayers
  signature: int RoleAssignment::GetAlternativePlayers(GroupRole role, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of alternative players assigned to a specific group
    role within a group.
  description: The GetAlternativePlayers method calculates and returns the count of
    alternative players designated for a given group role in a specified group. This
    functionality is typically used in role-based group management systems where players
    can be assigned as alternatives to primary roles such as tank, healer, or damage
    dealer. The method takes into account the current group composition and role assignments
    to determine how many players are available as backups for the specified role.
    It's commonly utilized in raid planning and group assignment logic to ensure proper
    role distribution and backup availability.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value specifying which role to count alternative
      players for. Valid values include TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, and other defined roles
      within the TrinityCore group system.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players and role assignments
      to be evaluated. Must not be null and must represent a valid group with active
      members.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of alternative players assigned
    to the specified role within the given group. Returns 0 if no alternatives are
    found or if the group is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to count alternative healers
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nint alternativeHealers\
      \ = roleAssignment.GetAlternativePlayers(HEALER, raidGroup);\nif (alternativeHealers\
      \ > 0) {\n    // Proceed with raid planning logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for alternative tanks in a party
    code: "Group* party = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(67890);\nint alternativeTanks =\
      \ roleAssignment.GetAlternativePlayers(TANK, party);\nif (alternativeTanks <\
      \ 2) {\n    // Alert players to find more tank alternatives\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that role assignments are properly maintained within
    the group system. The implementation may cache results for performance optimization,
    so changes to group roles might not be immediately reflected. Ensure that the
    Group pointer passed is valid and that the group contains active members before
    calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null Group pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always validate the group exists and has members before invoking this
    method. The method does not perform any automatic role assignment updates; it
    only reads existing assignments.
