  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: IsDebugMode
  signature: bool EnhancedBotAI::IsDebugMode() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the EnhancedBotAI is currently running in debug mode.
  description: The IsDebugMode method determines if the EnhancedBotAI instance has
    debug mode enabled. This flag typically controls additional logging, verbose output,
    or enhanced debugging capabilities within the bot's behavior system. When debug
    mode is active, the bot may provide more detailed information about its internal
    state, decision-making process, and actions taken during gameplay. The method
    performs a simple boolean check against an internal debug flag that can be set
    through configuration or initialization parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the EnhancedBotAI is in debug mode, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether enhanced logging or debugging features are currently active
    within the bot instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Mode Check
    code: "if (botAI->IsDebugMode())\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"EnhancedBot is running\
      \ in debug mode.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Behavior Based on Debug Mode
    code: "void MyBotBehavior::Update()\n{\n    if (IsDebugMode())\n    {\n      \
      \  sLog->outString(\"[DEBUG] Updating bot behavior...\");\n    }\n    // Normal\
      \ bot logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for logging and debugging purposes only. It
    does not affect the core functionality of the bot but may influence how much information
    is logged to the console or log files. The debug mode state is usually set during
    bot initialization or through configuration options.
