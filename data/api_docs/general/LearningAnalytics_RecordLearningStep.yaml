  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: RecordLearningStep
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::RecordLearningStep(uint32_t botGuid, const LearningDataPoint
    & dataPoint)
documentation:
  brief: Records a learning step for a bot with associated data points.
  description: The RecordLearningStep method is used to log a single learning event
    or step performed by a bot within the game environment. It takes the unique identifier
    of the bot and a structured data point containing information about the learning
    event, such as skill acquisition, behavior modification, or decision-making process.
    This method likely serves as part of a larger analytics or machine learning framework
    that tracks how bots improve or adapt their behavior over time. The method does
    not return any value, indicating it performs a side-effect operation for data
    collection purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot performing the learning step.
      This is typically a 32-bit unsigned integer that uniquely identifies the specific
      bot instance within the game world.
  - name: dataPoint
    description: A structured data point containing information about the learning
      event. The LearningDataPoint object likely includes fields such as skill ID,
      action taken, reward received, or state transition details that are essential
      for tracking and analyzing bot behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      LearningDataPoint data;

      data.skillId = 12345;

      data.reward = 10.0f;

      analytics.RecordLearningStep(98765, data);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other analytics methods to
    build a comprehensive learning profile for bots. It may internally serialize or
    queue the data point for batch processing or real-time analysis.
