  method: GetManaPercent
  signature: float MageAI::GetManaPercent()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current mana percentage of the MageAI instance.
  description: The GetManaPercent method computes the ratio of the mage's current
    mana to their maximum mana, expressed as a percentage. This value is typically
    used by AI logic to determine when to cast mana-efficient spells or when to switch
    to defensive abilities. The method performs no side effects and simply returns
    a floating-point value between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no mana and
    100.0 indicates full mana. This function is essential for mana management in scripted
    mage AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current mana percentage of the MageAI instance.
    The value ranges from 0.0 (no mana) to 100.0 (full mana).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "if (mageAI->GetManaPercent() > 50.0f)\n{\n    // Cast a high-mana spell\n\
      \    mageAI->CastSpell(SpellId::Fireball);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Use a low-mana\
      \ alternative\n    mageAI->CastSpell(SpellId::Frostbolt);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal mana tracking of the MageAI instance and
    assumes that the AI object has valid access to its owner's current and maximum
    mana values. It is recommended to call this method only when necessary, as it
    may involve accessing game state data.
