  class: BaselineRotationManager
  method: ApplyBaselineBuffs
  signature: void BaselineRotationManager::ApplyBaselineBuffs(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Applies baseline buffs to the specified bot character.
  description: The ApplyBaselineBuffs method is responsible for applying a set of
    predefined baseline buffs to a bot character within the TrinityCore framework.
    These buffs typically include fundamental enhancements such as stat boosts, defensive
    measures, or utility abilities that are considered essential for the bot's performance
    in various game scenarios. The method operates on a provided bot identifier and
    ensures that all necessary buff conditions are met before applying them. This
    function is commonly used during bot initialization or when transitioning between
    different combat states to maintain optimal character capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the bot
      character to which baseline buffs will be applied. The value should correspond
      to a valid bot entry in the game's database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;

      rotationManager.ApplyBaselineBuffs(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void InitializeBot(int botId) {\n    \
      \    BaselineRotationManager rotationManager;\n        rotationManager.ApplyBaselineBuffs(&botId);\n\
      \        // Additional initialization logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot identifier is valid and corresponds
    to an existing bot in the system. It does not perform validation on the input
    parameter, so callers should ensure proper handling of invalid identifiers. The
    actual buff application logic may depend on the current game state or configuration
    settings.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid bot identifier can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the bot exists and is in a valid state
    before invoking this function. Additionally, repeated calls without proper cooldowns
    might result in excessive resource consumption.
