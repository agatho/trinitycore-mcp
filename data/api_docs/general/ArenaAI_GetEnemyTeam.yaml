  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetEnemyTeam
  signature: int ArenaAI::GetEnemyTeam(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the team identifier of the enemy player in an arena match.
  description: The GetEnemyTeam method is used within the ArenaAI class to determine
    which team an enemy player belongs to during an arena battle. This method takes
    a pointer to a player's data structure and returns the corresponding team ID.
    In World of Warcraft's arena system, players are typically divided into two teams
    (Team 0 and Team 1), and this function helps AI logic distinguish between opposing
    players. The method is essential for implementing arena-specific behaviors such
    as targeting, threat calculation, and team-based strategies.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the player data structure for which to retrieve the
      enemy team ID. This parameter must point to a valid player object within an
      arena context.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the team ID of the specified enemy player.
    Typically, this will be either 0 or 1, indicating Team 0 or Team 1 respectively.
    Returns -1 if the input player is invalid or not part of an active arena match.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena AI Context
    code: "void MyArenaAI::Update()\n{\n    Player* enemy = GetEnemy();\n    int enemyTeam\
      \ = GetEnemyTeam(&enemy);\n    if (enemyTeam != -1)\n    {\n        // Proceed\
      \ with team-specific logic\n        DoSomethingBasedOnTeam(enemyTeam);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Enemy Team for Targeting Logic
    code: "bool ArenaAI::IsEnemyOnSameTeam(Unit* target)\n{\n    Player* player =\
      \ GetPlayer();\n    if (!player || !target)\n        return false;\n    \n \
      \   int playerTeam = GetEnemyTeam(&player);\n    int targetTeam = GetEnemyTeam((int*)&target);\n\
      \    \n    return (playerTeam != -1 && targetTeam != -1 && playerTeam == targetTeam);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player parameter points to a valid arena participant.
    The implementation likely relies on internal arena team tracking mechanisms within
    TrinityCore's arena system. It is recommended to validate the player object before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null player pointer may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the player belongs to an active
    arena match before invoking this function. The return value of -1 should be checked
    as an error condition.
