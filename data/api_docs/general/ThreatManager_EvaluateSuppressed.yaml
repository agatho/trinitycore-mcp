  signature: void ThreatManager::EvaluateSuppressed(bool canExpire)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and processes suppressed threat entries in the threat manager.
  description: The EvaluateSuppressed method is responsible for handling threat entries
    that have been marked as suppressed within the ThreatManager. This typically occurs
    when a creature's threat list needs to be updated or cleaned up, particularly
    in scenarios where certain threat sources are temporarily ignored or invalidated.
    The method may process these suppressed entries based on whether they can expire,
    affecting how the AI manages combat engagement and target selection. It is an
    internal utility function used by the threat system to maintain accurate and dynamic
    threat levels for creatures during combat.

  - title: Basic Usage in Threat Update Context
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_threatManager)\n \
      \       m_threatManager->EvaluateSuppressed(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the threat management system
    during AI updates or when threat lists are modified. It may involve iterating
    through suppressed entries and applying expiration logic if enabled.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand the internal state
    of the ThreatManager. Improper usage can lead to inconsistent threat states or
    unexpected behavior in combat AI.
