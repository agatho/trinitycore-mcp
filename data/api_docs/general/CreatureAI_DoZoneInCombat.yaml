documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat with nearby hostile units within the creature's zone.
  description: The DoZoneInCombat method triggers a creature to enter combat state
    with all hostile units located within its current zone or area. This method is
    typically invoked when a creature becomes aggroed or when an event causes it to
    engage enemies in its vicinity. It ensures that the creature's AI behavior transitions
    from passive to active combat mode, initiating combat with any eligible targets
    found in the surrounding area. The method does not take a target parameter directly;
    instead, it automatically identifies and engages nearby hostile creatures or players
    based on the creature's aggro rules and detection range.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEngagedWith(Unit*\
      \ who) override {\n        DoZoneInCombat();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Custom Aggro Conditions
    code: "class BossAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatStart() override\
      \ {\n        // Trigger zone in combat after a delay\n        events.ScheduleEvent(EVENT_ZONE_COMBAT,\
      \ 1000);\n    }\n    \n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override {\n        events.Update(diff);\n\
      \        \n        if (uint32 eventId = events.ExecuteEvent()) {\n         \
      \   switch (eventId) {\n                case EVENT_ZONE_COMBAT:\n          \
      \          DoZoneInCombat();\n                    break;\n            }\n  \
      \      }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the creature's current zone and aggro detection settings.
    It will only engage targets that are within the creature's defined detection range
    and are hostile to it. The AI behavior must be properly initialized for this method
    to function correctly. This method is commonly used in boss encounters or scripted
    events where a creature should immediately begin combat with all nearby enemies.
  warnings: Calling DoZoneInCombat without proper initialization of the creature's
    AI or aggro settings may result in unexpected behavior or no combat engagement.
    Ensure that the creature has valid threat tables and aggro rules set before invoking
    this method.
