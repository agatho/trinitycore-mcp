documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes all loaded scripts with the core system to ensure consistency
    and proper initialization.
  description: The SyncScripts method is responsible for synchronizing all currently
    loaded scripts with the TrinityCore server's core systems. This ensures that script
    definitions, handlers, and callbacks are properly registered and available for
    use within the game world. The method typically runs during server startup or
    when new scripts are dynamically loaded, ensuring that all script components are
    correctly initialized and linked to their respective game objects or events. It
    plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the scripting system by
    verifying that all registered scripts are in sync with the core engine's expectations.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sScriptMgr->SyncScripts();\n\
      \    // Continue with server startup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called after all scripts have been loaded
    but before the server begins accepting connections. It is not thread-safe and
    should only be invoked from the main server thread to prevent race conditions
    during script registration.
  warnings: Calling SyncScripts multiple times without proper cleanup between calls
    may lead to duplicate registrations or undefined behavior. This method must not
    be called concurrently with other script-related operations.
