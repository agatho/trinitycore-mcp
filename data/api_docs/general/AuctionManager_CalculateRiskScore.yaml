documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a risk score for a given auction flip opportunity
    based on market conditions and item valuation.
  description: The CalculateRiskScore method evaluates the potential risk associated
    with executing an auction flip opportunity. It analyzes various factors such as
    price discrepancies, market volatility, item demand, and historical auction data
    to determine a numerical risk score. This score helps in decision-making for automated
    auction house management systems by quantifying the likelihood of loss or profit.
    The method is typically used within the context of an AuctionManager class that
    oversees auction house operations and optimizes player profits through strategic
    bidding and selling decisions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated risk score for the flip opportunity.
    Higher values indicate higher risk, while lower values suggest a safer investment.
    The exact scale and interpretation of the score depend on internal weighting algorithms
    within the AuctionManager implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AuctionManager auctionMgr;\nFlipOpportunity opportunity;\n// ... populate\
      \ opportunity with relevant data ...\nuint32 riskScore = auctionMgr.CalculateRiskScore(opportunity);\n\
      if (riskScore < 50) {\n    // Consider proceeding with the flip\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs complex calculations involving multiple market
    indicators and may be computationally intensive. It should be called judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. The exact algorithm used for risk scoring
    is implementation-specific and may evolve with updates to the auction house system.
  warnings: The returned risk score is a relative measure and should not be treated
    as an absolute predictor of outcome. External factors such as server events or
    unexpected market shifts could affect actual results. Ensure that any automated
    systems using this method have appropriate fallback mechanisms for high-risk scenarios.
