  class: MovementGeneratorInformation
  method: MovementGeneratorInformation
  signature: void MovementGeneratorInformation::MovementGeneratorInformation(MovementGeneratorType
    type, int targetGUID, const std::string & targetName)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a MovementGeneratorInformation object with specified type, target
    GUID, and target name.
  description: The MovementGeneratorInformation constructor initializes an instance
    of the MovementGeneratorInformation class by setting its internal type, target
    GUID, and target name properties. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore
    framework to store and manage information about movement generators associated
    with game entities. The type parameter defines the kind of movement generator
    being represented, while the targetGUID and targetName identify the entity that
    the movement generator is targeting. This constructor is part of the core movement
    system infrastructure in World of Warcraft emulation, allowing for proper tracking
    and management of NPC and player movement behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The MovementGeneratorType enum value indicating the type of movement
      generator being initialized
  - name: targetGUID
    description: Integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the target entity
      for this movement generator
  - name: targetName
    description: String containing the name of the target entity for this movement
      generator
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MovementGeneratorInformation Initialization
    code: MovementGeneratorInformation info(MovementGeneratorType::IDLE_MOTION_TYPE,
      12345, "TargetNPC");
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Chase Movement Generator Information
    code: MovementGeneratorInformation chaseInfo(MovementGeneratorType::CHASE_MOTION_TYPE,
      67890, "PlayerTarget");
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the movement system and
    should not be called directly in most game logic. The MovementGeneratorInformation
    class is part of the internal movement tracking system and may be used for debugging
    or monitoring purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetGUID parameter correctly references an existing
    entity in the world to avoid invalid references. The type parameter must correspond
    to valid MovementGeneratorType enum values to prevent undefined behavior.
