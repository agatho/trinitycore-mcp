  method: GetValue

documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a shared pointer to a Value object by its name from the strategy's
    internal collection.
  description: The GetValue method is used to fetch a specific Value object stored
    within the Strategy class by providing its unique identifier (name). This method
    allows access to configuration values, state variables, or other data that the
    strategy manages. It is commonly used in AI decision-making processes where strategies
    need to query their internal data store for current conditions or settings. The
    returned shared pointer provides safe access to the Value object, ensuring proper
    memory management and preventing dangling references. This method does not modify
    the strategy's state but rather retrieves existing data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<Value> pointing to the requested Value object if found;
    returns a null pointer if no Value with the specified name exists in the strategy's
    collection.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving a Configuration Value
    code: "std::shared_ptr<Value> value = strategy->GetValue(\"attack_range\");\n\
      if (value)\n{\n    float range = value->Get<float>();\n    // Use the attack\
      \ range value\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Existence Before Access
    code: "auto value = strategy->GetValue(\"target_selection_priority\");\nif (value\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    int priority = value->Get<int>();\n    // Process the\
      \ priority value\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle case where value doesn't exist\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"Target selection priority not found in strategy\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation which may have performance implications
    if called frequently in tight loops. The returned shared_ptr maintains reference
    counting, so the Value object will remain alive as long as any shared_ptr references
    exist. The strategy's internal data store should be thread-safe if accessed from
    multiple threads.
  warnings: Be cautious when storing the returned shared_ptr for extended periods,
    as it may become invalid if the underlying Value is removed or replaced by another
    component. Always check for null returns before dereferencing to avoid runtime
    errors.
