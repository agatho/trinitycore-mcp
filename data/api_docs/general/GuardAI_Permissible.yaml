  class: GuardAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int GuardAI::Permissible(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the GuardAI class can be used for a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method is used to evaluate if a specific creature instance
    should utilize the GuardAI behavior. This method is part of the TrinityCore's
    AI system and follows the permissible pattern commonly used in game AI implementations.
    It returns an integer value indicating the level of permissiveness, where higher
    values indicate stronger suitability for using this AI type. The method typically
    checks creature properties such as faction, entry ID, or other criteria to decide
    if GuardAI should be assigned to that particular creature.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: A pointer to the Creature object being evaluated for GuardAI suitability.
      This parameter cannot be null and represents the specific creature instance
      that will be checked against GuardAI's criteria.
  returns: 'Returns an integer value indicating the permissiveness level:

    - PERMIT_BASE_PROTECT (typically 100) - Strongly permits use of GuardAI

    - PERMIT_BASE_NO - Does not permit use of GuardAI

    - Other values in between may indicate varying degrees of suitability

    The method should return a positive value if the creature is suitable for GuardAI,
    or zero/negative if not.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check creature suitability
    code: "int result = guardAI->Permissible(creature);\nif (result > 0) {\n    //\
      \ Creature is suitable for GuardAI\n    // Proceed with AI assignment\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in creature AI selection system
    code: "class GuardAIFactory {\npublic:\n    static AIWrapper* CreateAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) {\n        if (GuardAI::Permissible(creature) > 0) {\n         \
      \   return new GuardAI(creature);\n        }\n        return nullptr;\n    }\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization or when assigning
    AI types to creatures. It's important to note that the actual implementation may
    vary based on the specific version of TrinityCore and how GuardAI is configured.
    The permissible system allows for flexible AI assignment without hardcoding specific
    creature types, making it easier to extend or modify AI behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature parameter is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that different versions of TrinityCore might have varying return value semantics
    for this method.
