documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CalendarMgr instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~CalendarMgr destructor is automatically invoked when a CalendarMgr
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of calendar-related data structures, including event lists, invite tracking,
    and any allocated memory used by the calendar management system. The destructor
    does not take any parameters and performs no return operations. It is part of
    the standard C++ object lifecycle management and should not be called directly
    unless performing explicit object destruction.

  returns: null

  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void Cleanup() {\n    CalendarMgr* mgr = new CalendarMgr();\n    // ...\
      \ use mgr ...\n    delete mgr; // Triggers ~CalendarMgr\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime during object
    destruction. Developers should not manually invoke this method unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns.
