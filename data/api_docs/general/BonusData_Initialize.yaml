  class: BonusData
  method: Initialize
  signature: void BonusData::Initialize(const WorldPackets::Item::ItemInstance & itemInstance)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes bonus data for an item instance, setting up all applicable enchantment
    and gem bonuses.
  description: The Initialize method prepares bonus data for a given item instance
    by processing its enchantments, gems, and other bonus-related properties. This
    method is typically called during item creation or loading to ensure that all
    applicable bonuses are properly configured and ready for use in gameplay mechanics
    such as stat calculations, spell effects, and item comparisons. The method takes
    a WorldPackets::Item::ItemInstance parameter which contains the raw data about
    the item's current state including any applied enchantments and gems. It processes
    this information to populate internal bonus structures that will be used throughout
    the item's lifecycle in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: itemInstance
    description: The WorldPackets::Item::ItemInstance object containing the raw data
      for an item, including enchantments, gems, and other bonus-related properties
      that need to be processed and initialized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Bonus Initialization
    code: 'BonusData bonusData;

      WorldPackets::Item::ItemInstance itemInstance;

      // ... populate itemInstance with data ...

      bonusData.Initialize(itemInstance);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Bonuses During Item Creation
    code: "void Player::OnItemCreated(Item* item)\n{\n    BonusData bonusData;\n \
      \   bonusData.Initialize(item->GetItemInstance());\n    // Bonus data is now\
      \ ready for use in stat calculations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per item instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may result in duplicate bonus processing or unexpected behavior.
    The method assumes that the ItemInstance parameter contains valid data and does
    not perform extensive validation on the input parameters.
  warnings: Calling Initialize with an uninitialized or corrupted ItemInstance can
    lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the itemInstance parameter is properly
    populated before calling this method. This method modifies internal bonus state,
    so it should not be called concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
