  signature: int DB2Manager::GetCreatureLabels(uint32 creatureDifficultyId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the creature labels associated with a given creature difficulty
    ID from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetCreatureLabels method fetches label data for a specified creature
    difficulty ID, which is used in World of Warcraft to categorize and identify different
    versions of creatures (such as normal, heroic, mythic difficulties). This method
    accesses internal DB2 storage managed by the DB2Manager class. The returned value
    typically represents an index or identifier that maps to a set of labels defined
    in the game's data files. It is commonly used during creature spawning, loot distribution,
    and quest tracking logic where creature classification matters. The method assumes
    valid input and will return -1 if no matching labels are found for the given difficulty
    ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the creature label index associated with the provided
    creatureDifficultyId. Returns -1 if no matching labels exist for the specified
    difficulty ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Creature Labels for Difficulty ID
    code: "int labelIndex = sDB2Manager->GetCreatureLabels(12345);\nif (labelIndex\
      \ != -1)\n{\n    // Use the label index to fetch additional creature data\n\
      \    printf(\"Creature labels found at index: %d\\n\", labelIndex);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No creature labels found for difficulty ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on DB2 files being properly loaded and indexed. It is
    thread-safe as long as the underlying DB2Manager instance is not modified concurrently.
    Performance may be impacted if large numbers of creature difficulty IDs are queried
    frequently without caching.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided creatureDifficultyId corresponds to a valid entry
    in the game's DB2 files, otherwise the method will return -1. Avoid calling this
    method in performance-critical sections without prior caching of results.
