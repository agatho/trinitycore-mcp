    const int & end) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks for collision between two points on a map using the MovementValidator.
  description: The CheckCollision method determines whether a direct path between
    two points, specified by their start and end coordinates, is obstructed by terrain
    or other obstacles within the given map. This method is typically used in movement
    validation logic to ensure that characters can safely navigate from one location
    to another without passing through solid objects such as walls, cliffs, or other
    impassable terrain features. It performs a raycast or similar collision detection
    algorithm between the two points and returns true if no collision is detected,
    indicating a clear path, or false if an obstacle blocks the route. The method
    requires valid map data and coordinate values to function correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: Pointer to the Map object on which the collision check is performed.
      Must be a valid pointer to a loaded map instance.
  - name: start
    description: Integer representing the starting coordinate of the path to be checked.
      The value typically corresponds to a position in the map's coordinate system
      (e.g., grid or world coordinates).
  - name: end
    description: Integer representing the ending coordinate of the path to be checked.
      Must correspond to a valid location on the same map as the start point.
  returns: Returns true if there is no collision between the start and end points,
    meaning a clear path exists; returns false if a collision is detected, indicating
    that movement along this path would be blocked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Collision Check
    code: "Map* myMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);\nint startPoint = 100;\nint endPoint\
      \ = 200;\nbool isClear = MovementValidator::CheckCollision(myMap, startPoint,\
      \ endPoint);\nif (isClear) {\n    // Proceed with movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying map's collision detection system and
    assumes that the provided coordinates are valid for the specified map. Performance
    may vary depending on map complexity and the number of obstacles in the path.
    The method is likely used internally by movement handlers to validate character
    paths before allowing them to proceed.
  warnings: Ensure that the map pointer passed is not null and that both start and
    end coordinates are within valid ranges for the given map. Passing invalid or
    out-of-bounds coordinates may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
