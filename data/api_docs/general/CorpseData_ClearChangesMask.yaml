  class: CorpseData
  method: ClearChangesMask
  signature: void CorpseData::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the corpse data object, resetting its modified
    state.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a CorpseData object. This operation indicates that any previously marked
    modifications to the corpse's data have been acknowledged and committed, effectively
    clearing the 'dirty' flag that tracks which fields have been altered since the
    last synchronization. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this method is typically invoked after a corpse has been saved or processed, ensuring
    that subsequent operations do not mistakenly treat the corpse as having pending
    changes. The method does not modify any actual corpse data but only resets the
    tracking mechanism used for synchronization purposes.

  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask After Saving Corpse
    code: "CorpseData* corpse = sObjectAccessor->GetCorpseForPlayerGUID(playerGuid);\n\
      if (corpse)\n{\n    // Perform operations that may mark the corpse as changed\n\
      \    // ...\n    \n    // Clear the changes mask after saving or processing\n\
      \    corpse->ClearChangesMask();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal synchronization system for corpse data
    in TrinityCore. It's typically called automatically by the core when changes are
    persisted to the database, but may also be invoked manually during specific game
    logic flows where explicit control over change tracking is required.
