documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all bot schedules from the database into memory for
    execution.
  description: The LoadBotSchedules method retrieves all scheduled bot activities
    from the database and loads them into the in-memory schedule system. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when the bot scheduler needs to refresh
    its internal schedule data. It processes all active schedules, validates their
    configurations, and prepares them for execution according to their defined time
    intervals and conditions. The method ensures that all scheduled bot behaviors
    are properly initialized and ready to be executed by the scheduler thread.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadBotSchedules();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization or when schedule
    data needs to be refreshed. It performs database queries and may have performance
    implications if there are many bot schedules. The method assumes that the database
    connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate schedule entries. Ensure that no active scheduling operations are running
    when calling this method to avoid race conditions.
