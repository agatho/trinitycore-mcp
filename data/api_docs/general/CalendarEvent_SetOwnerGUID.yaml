  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetOwnerGUID
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetOwnerGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the calendar event owner
  description: The SetOwnerGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the owner
    of a calendar event. This GUID typically corresponds to a player's unique identifier
    within the TrinityCore database system. The method directly modifies the internal
    owner GUID member variable of the CalendarEvent object, allowing for proper association
    between events and their creators or owners. This is essential for maintaining
    data integrity in the game's calendar system and ensuring that event ownership
    can be properly tracked and validated.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who owns the calendar
      event. This should be a valid player GUID from the TrinityCore database system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Owner GUID for a New Calendar Event
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = new CalendarEvent();

      Player* player = ...; // Get reference to player

      event->SetOwnerGUID(player->GetGUID().GetRawValue());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Owner GUID for Existing Event
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(eventId);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    Player* newOwner = ...; // Get reference to new owner\n    event->SetOwnerGUID(newOwner->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent object.
    It is recommended to validate that the provided GUID corresponds to an existing
    player before calling this method to prevent orphaned event references. The method
    does not perform any database operations or send network updates - it only changes
    the in-memory representation.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in broken references
    within the calendar system. Ensure that the GUID parameter represents a valid
    player entity before calling this method. This method should not be called with
    a GUID of zero, as this typically indicates an invalid or uninitialized value.
