documentation:
  brief: Handles dummy spell effects for various game mechanics.
  description: The EffectDummy method in the Spell class is used to process and handle
    dummy spell effects that do not fit into standard categories. This method typically
    manages special or unique spell effects such as those involving area of effect,
    damage over time, or other non-standard gameplay mechanics. It serves as a hook
    for custom spell implementations where specific behaviors need to be defined beyond
    the normal spell processing flow.

  - title: Basic dummy spell handling example
    code: "void Spell::EffectDummy()\n{\n    // Implementation for handling dummy\
      \ effects\n    // This method is called when a spell requires special handling\n\
      \    // such as area of effect or damage over time\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell processing
    methods and should be implemented carefully to avoid conflicts with standard spell
    mechanics. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary calculations
    during spell execution.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code; it's intended
    for internal use within the spell processing system. Improper implementation can
    lead to game balance issues or unexpected behavior in spell effects.
