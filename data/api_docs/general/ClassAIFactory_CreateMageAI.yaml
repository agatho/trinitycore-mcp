documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new Mage AI bot instance, returning its identifier.
  description: The CreateMageAI method is responsible for instantiating a new Mage
    AI bot within the TrinityCore framework. This function allocates memory for the
    AI bot, configures its initial state according to Mage class specifications, and
    assigns it a unique identifier. The method integrates with the broader AI system
    to ensure proper initialization of spellcasting behavior, movement patterns, and
    combat strategies specific to the Mage class. It is typically invoked during bot
    creation or when dynamically spawning Mage AI entities in the game world. The
    returned identifier can be used for subsequent operations such as controlling
    the bot, retrieving its state, or managing its lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the unique identifier of the newly created
    Mage AI bot. A positive value indicates successful creation, while a negative
    value typically signifies an error condition such as insufficient resources or
    invalid configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mage AI Creation
    code: "int mageBotId = factory->CreateMageAI();\nif (mageBotId > 0) {\n    printf(\"\
      Mage AI created with ID: %d\\n\", mageBotId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to create Mage AI. Error code: %d\\n\", mageBotId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ClassAIFactory instance has been properly initialized
    and that sufficient system resources are available for creating new AI entities.
    The returned bot ID should be stored securely as it is required for all subsequent
    interactions with the created Mage AI instance.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the factory may result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, repeatedly calling this function
    without properly disposing of previous bots can lead to memory leaks in long-running
    applications.
