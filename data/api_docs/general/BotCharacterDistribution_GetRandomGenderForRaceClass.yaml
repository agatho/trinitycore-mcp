  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: GetRandomGenderForRaceClass
  signature: uint8 BotCharacterDistribution::GetRandomGenderForRaceClass(uint8 race,
    uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a random gender value suitable for the specified race and class combination
    in the bot character distribution system.
  description: The GetRandomGenderForRaceClass method selects a valid gender (0 for
    male, 1 for female) that is compatible with the given race and class parameters.
    This method ensures that only genders allowed for the specified race-class combination
    are returned, adhering to World of Warcraft's character creation rules. The method
    is typically used in bot character generation systems where random but valid character
    attributes are needed. It operates within the BotCharacterDistribution class which
    manages the distribution and selection logic for bot characters.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race identifier (uint8) for which to select a gender. Valid values
      correspond to World of Warcraft race IDs such as 1 for Human, 2 for Orc, etc.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier (uint8) for which to select a gender. Valid
      values correspond to World of Warcraft class IDs such as 1 for Warrior, 2 for
      Paladin, etc.
  returns: 'Returns a uint8 value representing the selected gender: 0 for male, 1
    for female. The returned gender is guaranteed to be valid for the specified race
    and class combination.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint8 gender = botDistribution->GetRandomGenderForRaceClass(1, 3); // Human
      Paladin

      // Returns either 0 (male) or 1 (female)'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Bot Character Creation Loop
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    uint8 race = urand(1, 10); // Random\
      \ race\n    uint8 classId = urand(1, 12); // Random class\n    uint8 gender\
      \ = botDistribution->GetRandomGenderForRaceClass(race, classId);\n    // Use\
      \ gender to create valid bot character\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the race and class parameters are valid identifiers
    within the World of Warcraft game data. The implementation likely uses internal
    lookup tables or configuration files to determine which gender combinations are
    allowed for each race-class pair. The method is designed to be thread-safe as
    it only reads from pre-configured data structures.
  warnings: Ensure that the race and class parameters passed to this method are valid
    identifiers within the game's data structure, otherwise behavior may be undefined
    or result in invalid character creation. This method does not validate input parameters
    beyond basic type checking.
