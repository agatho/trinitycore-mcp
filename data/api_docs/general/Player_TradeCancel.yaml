documentation:
  brief: Cancel a pending trade request between two players.
  description: The TradeCancel method terminates an ongoing trade session between
    two players, effectively breaking the trade process and returning both parties
    to their previous state. This method is typically invoked when a player decides
    to withdraw their trade offer or when a trade is interrupted due to various game
    mechanics such as distance or invalidation. The method ensures that any pending
    trade items are properly handled and that the players' inventory reflects the
    appropriate state after cancellation.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Trade Cancellation
    code: 'Player* player1 = new Player();

      Player* player2 = new Player();

      player1->TradeCancel(true);

      player2->TradeCancel(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of trade state variables and ensuring
    proper cleanup of trade items. Performance considerations involve avoiding unnecessary
    calls to this method when no active trade exists, as it may trigger additional
    checks or notifications.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a trade is actually in progress;
    calling it on players without an active trade can lead to undefined behavior or
    errors. Additionally, calling TradeCancel with sendback set to true will send
    a notification back to the initiating player, which may cause confusion if not
    handled correctly.
