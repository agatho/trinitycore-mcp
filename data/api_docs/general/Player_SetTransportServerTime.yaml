documentation:
  brief: Sets the transport server time for the player.
  description: This method updates the transport server time value for a player, which
    affects how the player's position is calculated during transport movement. The
    transport server time represents the current time in seconds since the transport
    started moving, and it's used to synchronize the player's position with the transport's
    movement. This method is typically called internally by the game engine when handling
    transport-related updates.
  parameters:
  - name: transportServerTime
    description: The transport server time value in seconds that represents how long
      the transport has been moving since its start.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting transport server time for a player

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during transport movement calculations and
    should be called when the transport starts moving or when its time changes. The
    value affects player position calculation during transport movement.
