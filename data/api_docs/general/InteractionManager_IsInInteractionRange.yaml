  class: InteractionManager
  method: IsInInteractionRange
  signature: bool InteractionManager::IsInInteractionRange(Player * bot, WorldObject
    * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player is within interaction range of a target object.
  description: The IsInInteractionRange method checks if a given Player object is
    within the valid interaction distance of a specified WorldObject. This functionality
    is crucial for determining whether a bot or player can interact with objects such
    as NPCs, game objects, or other players in the game world. The method typically
    considers the physical distance between the two entities and applies game-specific
    range limitations. It's commonly used in AI logic to ensure that interaction attempts
    are only made when within acceptable proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is being checked for proximity.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that serves as the target for range checking.
  returns: Returns true if the player is within interaction range of the target object,
    otherwise false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (interactionManager.IsInInteractionRange(playerBot, npcTarget)) {\n\
      \    // Perform interaction with NPC\n    playerBot->TalkToNpc(npcTarget);\n\
      } else {\n    // Move closer to target\n    playerBot->MoveTowards(npcTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a conditional interaction check
    code: "if (interactionManager.IsInInteractionRange(player, gameObject)) {\n  \
      \  player->UseGameObject(gameObject);\n} else {\n    // Handle out-of-range\
      \ case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"You are too far away to interact with\
      \ that.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal game range calculations and may consider
    factors such as bounding box sizes, line of sight, and specific interaction distances
    defined by the TrinityCore server configuration. It's important to note that this
    check does not account for movement or dynamic changes in position between calls.
  warnings: Ensure both player and target pointers are valid before calling this method
    to avoid crashes. The range calculation may be affected by different interaction
    types (e.g., gossip vs. use vs. attack), so verify the intended interaction type
    matches the expected behavior.
