documentation:
  brief: Resets all farming statistics to their default values.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all farming-related statistics
    within the FarmingStatistics class. This includes resetting counters, timers,
    and any tracked data related to player farming activities such as crop yields,
    harvest counts, and resource collection metrics. The method ensures that all internal
    state variables are set back to their initial conditions, effectively starting
    a fresh farming session. This is typically used when a player begins a new farming
    cycle or when statistics need to be cleared for administrative purposes.

  notes: This method should only be called when it's safe to clear all existing farming
    data. It is recommended to verify the player's farming state before calling this
    method to prevent unintended data loss.
