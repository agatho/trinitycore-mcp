  method: UpdateBotTurnIns
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::UpdateBotTurnIns(Player * bot, uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates quest turn-in states for a bot player based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateBotTurnIns method processes and updates the state of quest
    turn-ins for a specified bot player. It evaluates whether any quests that require
    turn-in are eligible for completion or if their status needs to be refreshed based
    on the time elapsed since the last update. This method is typically invoked during
    game loop iterations to ensure timely processing of quest-related events for automated
    players. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's AI and quest
    management systems, ensuring bots properly interact with quest givers and complete
    objectives as expected.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose quest turn-ins
      are to be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: diff
    description: Elapsed time in milliseconds since the last update call. Used to
      determine if quest timers or cooldowns should be processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    for (auto& bot : botPlayers)\n    {\n        UpdateBotTurnIns(bot,\
      \ 100); // Process with 100ms elapsed time\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI update system
    code: "void AIUpdate(Player* bot)\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32\
      \ currentTime = getMSTime();\n    uint32 diff = currentTime - lastUpdate;\n\
      \    UpdateBotTurnIns(bot, diff);\n    lastUpdate = currentTime;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the automated quest handling system for bots. It assumes
    that the player object passed in is a valid bot instance and not a real player.
    The internal logic may involve checking quest status, updating quest objectives,
    and potentially triggering quest completion events.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. Passing invalid or null pointers will likely result in crashes
    or unexpected behavior.
