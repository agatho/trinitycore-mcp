documentation:
  brief: Hides a specified creature NPC within the Battlefield system
  description: The HideNpc method is used to hide a Creature object from players within
    a Battlefield instance. This functionality is typically employed to manage NPC
    visibility during battlefield events, such as when NPCs need to be temporarily
    removed from view or when they are in an inactive state. The method operates by
    updating the creature's visibility status within the battlefield context, ensuring
    that it does not appear to players until explicitly shown again. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other battlefield management functions to control NPC
    behavior during various phases of a battlefield event.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that should be hidden from players.
      This parameter must not be null and must point to a valid Creature instance
      that has been registered with the Battlefield system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    Creature* npc = bf->GetCreature(5678);\n    if (npc)\n    {\n\
      \        bf->HideNpc(npc);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Hiding Multiple NPCs
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(1234);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    std::vector<uint64> npcGuids = {5678, 5679, 5680};\n    for\
      \ (uint64 guid : npcGuids)\n    {\n        Creature* npc = bf->GetCreature(guid);\n\
      \        if (npc)\n        {\n            bf->HideNpc(npc);\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the creature's visibility state within the battlefield
    context. It does not destroy or remove the creature from memory, but rather makes
    it invisible to players. The hidden NPC can be made visible again using the corresponding
    ShowNpc method. This functionality is particularly useful for managing complex
    battlefield scenarios where NPCs need to be dynamically shown and hidden based
    on game events.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and has
    been properly registered with the Battlefield system. Passing a null or invalid
    pointer may result in undefined behavior or crashes. Additionally, always verify
    that the Battlefield instance exists before calling this method to prevent potential
    runtime errors.
