  signature: float PlayerProfile::GetMovementVariance() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the variance of the player's movement over a specified
    period.
  description: The GetMovementVariance method computes the statistical variance of
    a player's movement patterns, which is typically used to detect anomalous behavior
    such as cheating or automation. This value represents how much the player's movement
    deviates from a baseline or expected pattern. The method may consider factors
    like speed changes, direction shifts, and overall mobility consistency. It is
    commonly employed in anti-cheat systems and gameplay analytics to identify suspicious
    activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the variance of the player's movement. Higher
    values indicate more erratic or inconsistent movement patterns, which may be flagged
    for further analysis.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Anti-Cheat System
    code: "float variance = playerProfile->GetMovementVariance();\nif (variance >\
      \ 10.0f) {\n    // Log suspicious movement behavior\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Player %u exhibits high movement variance: %f\", player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ variance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accumulates movement data over time and performs statistical
    calculations. It may be computationally expensive if called frequently, so caching
    or periodic updates are recommended for performance.
  warnings: The interpretation of variance thresholds should be carefully tuned to
    avoid false positives. Extremely low variance might also indicate bot-like behavior,
    not just legitimate play.
