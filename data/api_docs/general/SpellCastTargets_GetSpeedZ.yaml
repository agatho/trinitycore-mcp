  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: GetSpeedZ
  signature: float SpellCastTargets::GetSpeedZ() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vertical speed component of the spell cast target.
  description: The GetSpeedZ method retrieves the Z-axis (vertical) component of the
    speed vector for a spell's target. This value represents how fast the target is
    moving vertically during the spell casting process, which can affect spell trajectory
    calculations and hit detection. The method is typically used in conjunction with
    other speed-related functions to determine the complete movement vector of a spell
    target. It returns zero if no vertical movement is detected or if the target's
    movement data has not been initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the vertical (Z-axis) speed component of the
    spell target. Positive values indicate upward movement, negative values indicate
    downward movement, and zero indicates no vertical velocity.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve vertical speed for spell targeting
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\n// ... set up targets ...\nfloat verticalSpeed\
      \ = targets.GetSpeedZ();\nif (verticalSpeed != 0.0f)\n{\n    // Adjust spell\
      \ trajectory based on vertical movement\n    // ... implementation details ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in spell targeting calculations within TrinityCore's
    combat system. The returned value should be interpreted as part of a three-dimensional
    velocity vector along with X and Y components. Ensure that the SpellCastTargets
    object has been properly initialized before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or invalid SpellCastTargets object
    may result in unpredictable behavior. Always verify that target data is valid
    before accessing speed components. This method does not perform any validation
    checks internally.
