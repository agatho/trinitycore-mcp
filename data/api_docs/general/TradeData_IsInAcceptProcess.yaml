  signature: bool TradeData::IsInAcceptProcess() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the trade is currently in the acceptance process.
  description: The IsInAcceptProcess method checks if the trade operation is currently
    in a state where one or both parties have accepted the trade offer but have not
    yet confirmed it. This typically occurs during the final stage of a trade negotiation,
    where players must explicitly accept the trade to complete it. The method returns
    true when the trade is in this transitional state and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper trade state management within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade is currently in the acceptance process, indicating
    that one or both parties have accepted but not yet confirmed the trade. Returns
    false if the trade is not in an active acceptance state, meaning either no party
    has accepted yet or the trade has already been finalized.
  examples:
  - title: Check Trade Acceptance State
    code: "if (playerTradeData->IsInAcceptProcess()) {\n    // Handle trade in acceptance\
      \ phase\n    sLog->outString(\"Trade is waiting for final confirmation.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the trading system to manage
    state transitions and prevent invalid operations during trade negotiations. It's
    important to note that this check should be performed before allowing any further
    trade modifications or confirmations.
