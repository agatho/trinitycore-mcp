documentation:
  brief: Loads an item from the database using its GUID and owner information
  description: The LoadFromDB method retrieves item data from the database based on
    the provided GUID and ownerGuid, populating the item's fields with data from the
    database. This method is typically used during item creation or when loading items
    from the database for player characters. The method handles the retrieval of item
    data including item entry, owner GUID, and other relevant fields necessary for
    item initialization. It performs validation checks to ensure proper database data
    integrity and returns a boolean indicating success or failure of the load operation.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item being loaded from the database
  - name: ownerGuid
    description: The GUID of the player who owns the item, used for validation and
      retrieval purposes
  - name: fields
    description: Pointer to an array of database fields containing item data such
      as item entry, owner GUID, and other relevant information
  - name: entry
    description: The item entry ID used for validation and matching against the database
      record
  returns: Returns true if the item was successfully loaded from the database, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the database record is not found or
    if there are validation errors in the data fields.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Loading Example
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nbool success = item->LoadFromDB(12345, 67890,\
      \ &fields[0], 1234);\nif (success) {\n    // Item loaded successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Item Loading with Error Handling
    code: "Item* item = new Item();\nint guid = 12345;\nint ownerGuid = 67890;\nuint32\
      \ entry = 1234;\nint fields[10];\nbool success = item->LoadFromDB(guid, ownerGuid,\
      \ fields, entry);\nif (!success) {\n    // Handle error case\n    // Item failed\
      \ to load from database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during item initialization and requires proper
    database access. The method performs validation checks on the provided GUID and
    ownerGuid to ensure data integrity. It's important to note that this method may
    be called from multiple threads, so thread safety considerations should be taken
    into account when using it in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: The method assumes that the database fields are properly initialized before
    calling. If fields are not correctly populated or if GUID values are invalid,
    the method may return false without error. Also, this method does not validate
    item entry against database records, which could lead to inconsistencies if used
    incorrectly.
