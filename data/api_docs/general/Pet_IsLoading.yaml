  method: IsLoading
  signature: bool Pet::IsLoading() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the pet is currently in a loading state.
  description: The IsLoading method determines whether the pet object is in the process
    of being loaded from the database or memory. This status is typically used during
    the initialization phase when a pet's data is being retrieved and prepared for
    use. The method returns true if the pet is actively loading, and false otherwise.
    This check is important for preventing operations on partially initialized pets
    that could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the pet is currently in a loading state, false if it has
    finished loading and is ready for use.
  examples:
  - title: Check if pet is loading before performing actions
    code: "if (!pet->IsLoading()) {\n    // Safe to perform operations on the pet\n\
      \    pet->SetOwner(player);\n    pet->SaveToDB();\n} else {\n    // Pet is still\
      \ loading, defer operations\n    sLog->outString(\"Pet is still loading, deferring\
      \ operations.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework to
    manage pet lifecycle states. It's important to note that while a pet is loading,
    most of its data members may be uninitialized or in an inconsistent state, making
    it unsafe to perform operations on the pet until IsLoading() returns false.
  warnings: Calling methods that rely on pet data while IsLoading() returns true can
    result in crashes or undefined behavior. Always check this method before performing
    any operations that require complete pet initialization.
