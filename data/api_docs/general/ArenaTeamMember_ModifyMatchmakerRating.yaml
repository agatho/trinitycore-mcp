  class: ArenaTeamMember
  method: ModifyMatchmakerRating
  signature: void ArenaTeamMember::ModifyMatchmakerRating(int32 mod, uint32 slot)
documentation:
  brief: Modifies the matchmaker rating of an arena team member by the specified value.
  description: The ModifyMatchmakerRating method adjusts the matchmaker rating (MMR)
    of a specific arena team member. This rating is used by the game's matchmaking
    system to balance teams in arena battles. The method takes a signed integer modifier
    and a slot index, which determines which arena bracket the rating modification
    applies to. This function is typically called during or after arena matches to
    update player ratings based on match outcomes. The modification can be positive
    or negative depending on whether the player won or lost their match.
  parameters:
  - name: mod
    description: The signed integer value by which to modify the matchmaker rating.
      Positive values increase the rating, negative values decrease it.
  - name: slot
    description: The arena team slot index (0-2) indicating which bracket (2v2, 3v3,
      or 5v5) the rating modification applies to.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Increase matchmaker rating by 50 points
    code: 'ArenaTeamMember* member = ...;

      member->ModifyMatchmakerRating(50, 1); // Modify 3v3 rating'
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrease matchmaker rating after a loss
    code: 'ArenaTeamMember* member = ...;

      member->ModifyMatchmakerRating(-100, 2); // Reduce 5v5 rating by 100 points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal matchmaker rating value stored
    for each arena team member. It does not automatically save changes to the database;
    persistence depends on other systems in TrinityCore. The slot parameter should
    be validated against valid arena bracket indices (0-2) to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid slot values may cause memory corruption
    or incorrect matchmaking behavior. Always ensure that the slot index corresponds
    to a valid arena bracket (0 for 2v2, 1 for 3v3, 2 for 5v5). Improper use can lead
    to unbalanced matchmaking and player rating inconsistencies.
