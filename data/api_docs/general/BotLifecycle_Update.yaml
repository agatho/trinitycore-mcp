  class: BotLifecycle
  method: Update
  signature: void BotLifecycle::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot lifecycle state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for advancing the internal state of
    a bot lifecycle component within the TrinityCore framework. It processes timed
    events, handles AI behavior updates, and manages the lifecycle transitions of
    bots. This method is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals
    to ensure that bot behaviors remain synchronized with the game world's progression.
    The method uses the provided time delta (diff) to determine how much time has
    passed since the last update and adjusts bot states accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based behaviors and state transitions for the
      bot lifecycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sWorld->getWorldTickTime();\n   \
      \ botLifecycle->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Custom Time Delta
    code: "void ProcessBotUpdates()\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = getMSTime();\n\
      \    uint32 current = getMSTime();\n    uint32 diff = current - lastUpdate;\n\
      \    lastUpdate = current;\n    botLifecycle->Update(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game update loop to
    ensure proper bot behavior. The implementation likely handles various internal
    timers and state machines that control bot AI, movement, and interaction with
    the game world.
  warnings: Failure to call this method regularly may result in bots becoming unresponsive
    or exhibiting incorrect behavior. The diff parameter must be a valid time delta;
    passing zero or negative values could cause unexpected behavior in time-sensitive
    operations.
