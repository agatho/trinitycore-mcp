  signature: void AoEDecisionManager::UpdateTargetCache()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal cache of target units for AoE decision making.
  description: The UpdateTargetCache method refreshes the cached list of valid targets
    within the AoE decision manager. This method is typically invoked during AI update
    cycles to ensure that the target list reflects current game state, including unit
    positions, health status, and threat levels. It recalculates and stores relevant
    target information for use in subsequent AoE spell or ability decisions, improving
    performance by avoiding repeated expensive target evaluation calculations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void CustomAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n  \
      \  m_aoeDecisionManager->UpdateTargetCache();\n    // ... continue with decision\
      \ making\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI update cycles to maintain
    accurate target information. The cache is typically invalidated and rebuilt when
    target conditions change significantly, such as unit movement or health modifications.
