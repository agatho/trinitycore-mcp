  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::SendAchievementEarned(const AchievementEntry
    * achievement) const
documentation:
  brief: Sends a guild achievement earned message to all online guild members.
  description: The SendAchievementEarned method is responsible for broadcasting a
    notification to all currently online members of a guild when an achievement has
    been earned. This method ensures that guild members are informed in real-time
    about significant accomplishments within their guild context. The function likely
    constructs and sends a specific packet through the TrinityCore network layer to
    update client interfaces with the newly earned achievement data.
  parameters:
  - name: achievement
    description: Pointer to the AchievementEntry structure containing details about
      the achievement that was earned. This parameter must be a valid pointer to an
      existing achievement entry; passing null may result in undefined behavior or
      runtime errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void OnPlayerAchievementEarned(Player* player, uint32 achievementId)\n\
      {\n    if (Guild* guild = player->GetGuild())\n    {\n        if (const AchievementEntry*\
      \ achievement = sAchievementMgr->GetAchievement(achievementId))\n        {\n\
      \            guild->GetGuildAchievementMgr()->SendAchievementEarned(achievement);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the game's achievement system
    when a player earns an achievement that should be shared with their guild. It
    may perform checks to ensure only valid achievements are broadcasted and that
    the sending player is part of a guild.
  warnings: Ensure that the achievement pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null, as invalid pointers can lead to crashes or memory corruption. Also,
    calling this method outside of a proper guild context might result in unintended
    behavior.
