  method: GetBossInfo
  signature: BossInfo * InstanceScript::GetBossInfo(uint32 id)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves boss information structure for a specified boss ID within the instance.
  description: The GetBossInfo method retrieves a pointer to the BossInfo structure
    associated with a given boss identifier within the current instance. This method
    is typically used by InstanceScript subclasses to access or modify the state of
    bosses in a dungeon or raid. The returned BossInfo structure contains metadata
    about the boss including its health, status, and other relevant information. It's
    important to note that this method should only be called after the boss has been
    properly initialized within the instance script context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the BossInfo structure for the specified boss ID, or nullptr
    if no boss with the given ID exists in the current instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check boss status
    code: "if (BossInfo* bossInfo = instance->GetBossInfo(BOSS_MARWYN)) {\n    if\
      \ (bossInfo->IsEncounterInProgress()) {\n        // Handle ongoing encounter\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating boss state using retrieved info
    code: "if (BossInfo* bossInfo = instance->GetBossInfo(BOSS_SINDRAGOSA)) {\n  \
      \  if (bossInfo->GetHealth() <= 0) {\n        bossInfo->SetEncounterState(ENCOUNTER_DONE);\n\
      \        // Trigger any additional logic for boss death\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BossInfo structures have been properly initialized
    during instance creation. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the instance
    script remains active and the boss data has not been destroyed. Developers should
    always check for null returns before using the returned pointer to prevent access
    violations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid boss ID may return a null pointer,
    which can lead to crashes if not properly checked. Always validate the returned
    pointer before dereferencing it. Additionally, modifying BossInfo directly through
    this interface should be done carefully as it may affect encounter progression
    and quest completion states.
