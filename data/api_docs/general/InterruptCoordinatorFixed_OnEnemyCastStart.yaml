  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: OnEnemyCastStart
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::OnEnemyCastStart(Unit * caster, uint32
    spellId, uint32 castTime)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when an enemy unit begins casting a spell, triggering potential
    interrupt logic.
  description: The OnEnemyCastStart method is invoked when an enemy unit starts casting
    a spell. This method is typically used within the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class
    to manage and respond to enemy spellcasting events. It allows the system to determine
    whether an interrupt should occur based on the caster's identity, the spell being
    cast, and the cast time. The method does not return any value but may trigger
    internal logic such as interrupting the cast or applying effects related to the
    interruption.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the enemy unit that is starting
      to cast a spell. This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing Unit
      instance.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell being cast by the caster. This
      value corresponds to the Spell ID defined in the game's spell database.
  - name: castTime
    description: The duration (in milliseconds) that the spell will take to complete
      its casting. This is used to determine how long the interrupt window may be
      active.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an AI handler
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = me->GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        if (target->IsNonMeleeSpellCast(true))\n        {\n        \
      \    InterruptCoordinatorFixed::OnEnemyCastStart(target, target->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL)->m_spellInfo->Id,\
      \ target->GetCurrentSpell(CURRENT_GENERIC_SPELL)->m_castTime);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the interrupt coordination system and should be called
    only when a valid enemy unit is casting a spell. It assumes that the caster object
    is not null and that the spell information is accessible. Performance-wise, this
    method should be lightweight as it's often called during AI updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'caster' parameter is not null before calling this method
    to avoid crashes. Also, make sure that the spellId and castTime parameters reflect
    the actual casting state of the unit to prevent incorrect behavior in interrupt
    logic.
