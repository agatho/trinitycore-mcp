  brief: Resets all player achievements and their progress to initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears all achievement data for a player, including
    completed achievements, progress counters, and any associated flags. This operation
    effectively restores the player's achievement state as if they had never earned
    any achievements. The method is typically used during account resets, character
    transfers, or when administrators need to clear a player's achievement history.
    It ensures that all achievement-related data in the database and in-memory structures
    are properly cleared and reset to default values.

  examples:
  - title: Reset Player Achievements

  notes: This method performs both in-memory and database cleanup operations. It should
    be used carefully as it permanently removes achievement data. The reset operation
    may have performance implications during high-traffic periods due to database
    updates.
  warnings: Using this method will permanently delete all achievement progress for
    the player. Ensure proper authorization before calling this method, especially
    in automated systems or admin tools.
