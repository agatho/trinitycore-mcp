documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the whisper whitelist, preventing them from receiving
    whispers from the current player.
  description: This method removes a specified player's GUID from the current player's
    whisper whitelist. The whisper whitelist is a list of players that the current
    player can receive whispers from, and removing someone from this list prevents
    them from sending whispers to the player. This functionality is part of the game's
    privacy and communication system, allowing players to control who can contact
    them via whispers. The method operates on the player's internal data structures
    and does not directly interact with the database or network layer.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to remove from the whisper
      whitelist. This must be a valid GUID representing an existing player in the
      game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a player from whisper whitelist
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      player->RemoveFromWhisperWhiteList(targetGuid);'
