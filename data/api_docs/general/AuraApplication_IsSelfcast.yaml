  signature: bool AuraApplication::IsSelfcast() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the aura application is self-cast.
  description: The IsSelfcast method checks if the aura application was cast by the
    same unit that is affected by it. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft mechanics
    to identify self-applied auras, such as those from items, abilities, or spells
    that affect the caster themselves. The method returns true when the aura's caster
    and target are the same unit, and false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for implementing proper aura handling and effects where self-cast behavior differs
    from normal cast behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the aura was self-cast (caster equals target), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an aura is self-cast
    code: "if (auraApp->IsSelfcast()) {\n    // Handle self-cast specific logic\n\
      \    SendSystemMessage(\"This aura was cast on yourself.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in aura application processing
    code: "void ProcessAuraApplication(AuraApplication* app) {\n    if (app->IsSelfcast())\
      \ {\n        // Apply special effects for self-cast auras\n        ModifyPlayerStats(true);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Apply normal aura effects\n        ModifyPlayerStats(false);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the AuraApplication object and
    should only be called after the aura has been properly initialized and applied.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other aura-related methods to determine
    how to process or display aura effects.
