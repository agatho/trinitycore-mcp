  class: ThreatReference
  method: GetThreat
  signature: float ThreatReference::GetThreat() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current threat value associated with this ThreatReference object.
  description: The GetThreat method returns the float value representing the threat
    level currently assigned to a specific unit or entity within the game's threat
    system. This value is used by the AI to determine which target a creature should
    prioritize attacking. The threat value typically increases as the unit deals damage
    or applies certain effects to a target, and decreases over time or when the target
    is no longer engaged in combat. This method provides read-only access to the internal
    threat state without modifying it.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current threat level of this ThreatReference.
    Higher values indicate higher priority for the AI to attack this target. The exact
    range and interpretation may depend on the implementation details of the threat
    system, but generally follows a normalized scale where 0.0 represents no threat
    and higher values represent increasing levels of threat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float threatLevel = threatRef->GetThreat();\nif (threatLevel > 100.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Target is highly threatened, AI should prioritize attacking\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Threat Levels
    code: "float playerThreat = playerThreatRef->GetThreat();\nfloat npcThreat = npcThreatRef->GetThreat();\n\
      if (playerThreat > npcThreat)\n{\n    // Player has higher threat, AI should\
      \ focus on player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of creature AI behavior
    to make decisions about target selection. The returned value may be affected by
    various factors including combat actions, spell effects, and time-based decay
    mechanisms. It's important to note that this is a read-only operation and does
    not modify the internal threat state.
  warnings: The threat value returned by this method should not be directly modified
    as it may lead to inconsistent AI behavior or unexpected combat outcomes. Additionally,
    in multi-threaded environments, the value might change between when it's retrieved
    and when it's used, so consider locking mechanisms if precise timing is required.
