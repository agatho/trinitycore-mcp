  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: ShareOptimizations
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::ShareOptimizations(uint32_t sourceBotGuid,
    uint32_t targetBotGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Shares performance optimizations between two bot instances using their GUIDs.
  description: The ShareOptimizations method facilitates the transfer of performance-related
    configurations and optimization settings from one bot instance to another within
    the TrinityCore framework. This functionality is typically used in AI-driven bot
    systems where optimization strategies need to be propagated across multiple instances
    to improve overall system efficiency. The method operates on unique identifiers
    (GUIDs) that represent specific bot instances, ensuring that optimizations are
    correctly mapped between source and target entities. Precondition for this method
    is that both source and target bot GUIDs must correspond to valid, active bot
    instances within the current session.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceBotGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot instance from which optimizations
      will be shared.
  - name: targetBotGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot instance that will receive the
      shared optimizations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t sourceGuid = 1001;

      uint32_t targetGuid = 1002;

      optimizer.ShareOptimizations(sourceGuid, targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Validation
    code: "PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;\nuint32_t sourceGuid = GetActiveBotGUID(0);\n\
      uint32_t targetGuid = GetActiveBotGUID(1);\nif (sourceGuid != 0 && targetGuid\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    optimizer.ShareOptimizations(sourceGuid, targetGuid);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Handle invalid GUID case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both source and target bot instances are already
    initialized and registered within the performance optimization subsystem. It does
    not perform any validation on whether the bots are of compatible types or versions,
    so developers should ensure compatibility before calling this function. The sharing
    operation is typically asynchronous to avoid blocking the main thread during optimization
    transfer.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent GUIDs may result in undefined
    behavior or system instability. Ensure that all bot instances referenced by the
    GUIDs are active and properly initialized before invoking ShareOptimizations.
    Avoid calling this method concurrently from multiple threads without proper synchronization
    mechanisms.
