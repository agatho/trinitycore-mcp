documentation:
  brief: Initializes the pool manager system to prepare for object pooling operations
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal data structures and systems
    required for the PoolMgr to manage object pools. This method typically prepares
    the pool manager to handle dynamic allocation and recycling of game objects such
    as creatures, game objects, items, and other entities. It ensures that all necessary
    memory pools are created and configured properly before any pooling operations
    begin. The initialization process may involve setting up thread-safe containers,
    initializing statistics tracking, and preparing internal lookup tables for efficient
    object retrieval and management.

  - title: Basic Pool Manager Initialization
    code: PoolMgr::instance()->Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during server startup before
    any pooling operations are performed. The initialization process is generally
    thread-safe and designed to be called only once to avoid race conditions or duplicate
    setup.
