documentation:
  brief: Subscribes a BotAI instance to all loot events in the EventBus
  description: The SubscribeAll method registers a given BotAI subscriber to receive
    notifications for all types of loot events within the LootEventBus. This allows
    the bot to react to various loot-related occurrences such as item drops, loot
    acquisition, and other loot-related activities without needing to subscribe individually
    to each event type. The method typically returns true if the subscription was
    successful or false if it failed due to invalid input or internal errors. This
    functionality is essential for bots that need comprehensive loot tracking and
    decision-making capabilities in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the BotAI subscriber was successfully registered to all
    loot events, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate an invalid
    subscriber pointer or internal subscription failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Subscription Example
    code: "BotAI* myBot = new BotAI();\nbool success = LootEventBus::SubscribeAll(myBot);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Bot is now subscribed to all loot events\n    printf(\"\
      Bot successfully subscribed to all loot events\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ subscription failure\n    printf(\"Failed to subscribe bot to loot events\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely internally iterates through all defined loot event types
    and registers the subscriber with each one. It's important to ensure that the
    BotAI instance remains valid for the duration of its subscription, as dangling
    pointers could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Calling SubscribeAll with a null or invalid BotAI pointer will likely
    cause undefined behavior or crash the application. Always validate the BotAI instance
    before calling this method and ensure proper cleanup when unsubscribing.
