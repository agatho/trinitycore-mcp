documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QFunction object with specified state and action sizes for
    reinforcement learning.
  description: The QFunction constructor initializes a Q-function table used in reinforcement
    learning algorithms within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up the
    internal data structures required to store Q-values for state-action pairs, where
    stateSize defines the number of possible states and actionSize defines the number
    of possible actions. The initialized QFunction can then be used to evaluate the
    expected utility of taking specific actions in given states during training or
    decision-making processes. This implementation is typically part of AI behavior
    systems that utilize temporal difference learning methods such as Q-learning.

  - title: Basic QFunction Initialization
    code: 'QFunction qFunc(100, 10);

      // Initializes a Q-function with 100 possible states and 10 possible actions'
    language: cpp
  - title: QFunction in AI Behavior Context
    code: "class EnemyAI {\n    QFunction qFunc;\n    public:\n        EnemyAI() :\
      \ qFunc(50, 5) {}\n        void Update()\n        {\n            // Use qFunc\
      \ to determine optimal actions based on current state\n        }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor allocates memory for a Q-table with dimensions [stateSize][actionSize].
    The implementation assumes discrete state and action spaces. Performance may degrade
    significantly with large state or action sizes due to memory requirements. The
    QFunction is designed for single-threaded use in AI decision-making contexts.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with extremely large values for stateSize
    or actionSize as it will result in excessive memory allocation. Ensure that the
    state and action spaces are properly discretized before initialization. This implementation
    does not handle dynamic state/action space changes after construction.
