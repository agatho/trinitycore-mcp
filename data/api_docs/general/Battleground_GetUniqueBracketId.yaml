  brief: Returns the unique bracket identifier for the battleground instance.
  description: The GetUniqueBracketId method retrieves a unique integer identifier
    that represents the bracket or grouping of players within a battleground. This
    identifier is used internally by TrinityCore to manage player matchmaking, team
    assignments, and battleground scaling. The bracket ID typically corresponds to
    specific player level ranges or group sizes that are configured for the battleground
    type. This method is essential for ensuring proper player balancing and gameplay
    mechanics during battleground operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique bracket identifier for this battleground
    instance. The value is typically used internally by the game engine to determine
    player grouping, matchmaking rules, and scaling factors for the battleground.
  examples:

    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      int bracketId = bg->GetUniqueBracketId();

      printf("Battleground bracket ID: %d\n", bracketId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground initialization and player
    assignment phases. The bracket ID may be used in conjunction with other methods
    like GetMaxPlayersPerTeam() or GetMinPlayersPerTeam() to determine how many players
    can join each side of the battleground.
