  class: TradeManager
  method: AddToBlacklist
  signature: void TradeManager::AddToBlacklist(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player GUID to the trade blacklist, preventing that player from being
    traded with.
  description: The AddToBlacklist method adds a specified player's global unique identifier
    (GUID) to the trade manager's blacklist. When a player is blacklisted, they cannot
    be involved in trade transactions with the current player. This functionality
    is typically used to prevent unwanted trades or interactions with specific players.
    The method does not perform any validation on the GUID itself, so it's assumed
    that the caller has verified the GUID is valid and refers to an existing player.
    This method is part of the general trade management system in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player to be added to
      the blacklist. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game's database
      or player object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TradeManager* tradeMgr = player->GetTradeData();

      tradeMgr->AddToBlacklist(12345); // Blacklists player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state and should only be called when the trade
    manager is in a valid state. The blacklist is typically stored in memory and may
    not persist across server restarts unless explicitly saved to the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method refers to an actual player,
    as adding invalid or non-existent GUIDs could lead to unexpected behavior or errors
    during trade operations.
