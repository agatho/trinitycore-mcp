  class: FlightMasterManager
  method: GetCPUUsage
  signature: float FlightMasterManager::GetCPUUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the flight master
    manager component.
  description: The GetCPUUsage method provides a floating-point representation of
    the CPU load imposed by the FlightMasterManager class. This metric is typically
    used for performance monitoring, debugging, or load balancing purposes within
    the TrinityCore server environment. The value returned represents the percentage
    of CPU time utilized by the flight master manager operations, with 0.0 indicating
    no usage and 100.0 indicating full utilization. The method performs internal calculations
    based on timing measurements or system resource queries to determine this metric.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current CPU usage percentage of the FlightMasterManager
    component. Values typically range from 0.0 (no usage) to 100.0 (full utilization),
    though exact ranges may depend on implementation details and system constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CPU Usage Monitoring
    code: 'FlightMasterManager* fmManager = sObjectMgr->GetFlightMasterManager();

      float cpuUsage = fmManager->GetCPUUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, "Flight Master Manager CPU Usage: %.2f%%", cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve timing measurements or system calls that could introduce
    minimal overhead. It's recommended to cache the result if frequent access is needed
    to avoid repeated expensive calculations. The accuracy of the returned value depends
    on the underlying implementation and may vary across different server configurations
    or platforms.
