documentation:
  brief: Stops and cleans up all active bot profiling operations
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing bot profiling activities
    within the TrinityCore instance. It ensures that any active profiling sessions
    are properly closed, resources are released, and internal state is reset to a
    clean condition. This method is typically called during server shutdown or when
    deactivating bot profiling functionality entirely. The method performs necessary
    cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper system state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: BotProfiler::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when no bot profiling operations are actively
    running to avoid potential race conditions. It is recommended to call this method
    before server shutdown or when disabling bot functionality entirely.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while profiling sessions are active may result in undefined
    behavior or resource leaks. Ensure all profiling has been properly stopped before
    invoking this method.
