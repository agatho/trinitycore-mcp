  class: ThreatCalculator
  method: GetClassThreatModifier
  signature: float ThreatCalculator::GetClassThreatModifier(uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the threat modifier value for a specified class ID used in threat
    calculation mechanics.
  description: The GetClassThreatModifier method retrieves a predefined float value
    that represents how much threat a specific class generates or receives during
    combat. This value is typically used within the ThreatCalculator system to adjust
    threat generation rates based on player class, ensuring balanced gameplay mechanics.
    The method likely accesses internal class-specific configurations stored in game
    data tables or configuration files. It's designed to be called during combat events
    when threat calculations are needed, such as when a player attacks an enemy or
    when threat is transferred between mobs and players.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the threat modifier for the specified class
    ID. This value typically ranges from 0.0f upwards, where 1.0f represents normal
    threat generation, values above 1.0f increase threat generation, and values below
    1.0f decrease it. Returns 0.0f if the class ID is invalid or not found in the
    internal lookup table.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float modifier = threatCalculator->GetClassThreatModifier(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns the threat modifier for warriors, typically around 1.0f'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Threat Calculation Example
    code: 'uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();

      float classMod = threatCalculator->GetClassThreatModifier(playerClass);

      float baseThreat = 100.0f;

      float finalThreat = baseThreat * classMod;

      // Applies class-specific threat modifier to calculated threat value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal lookup table or configuration system
    to map class IDs to their respective threat modifiers. The implementation may
    be optimized for frequent calls during combat events. It's important to note that
    class IDs should be validated before calling this method, as invalid IDs might
    return unexpected values.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid class ID (outside the valid range
    of 0-11 for standard WoW classes) may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    threat calculations. Ensure proper validation of class IDs before use to prevent
    game balance issues.
