  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::CoordinateEventTiming(int * player, uint32
    eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates timing for guild events by processing player data and event identifiers.
  description: The CoordinateEventTiming method manages the synchronization of guild-related
    events within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a pointer to an integer representing
    a player identifier and a uint32 event ID, then performs internal logic to ensure
    proper timing and coordination of guild activities such as raids, dungeons, or
    social gatherings. This method likely interacts with internal guild management
    systems to maintain event consistency across multiple players and servers. The
    method does not return any value but modifies internal state related to event
    scheduling and player participation tracking.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) for
      whom event timing is being coordinated. This parameter must point to a valid
      player ID or may be null, though behavior with null values is unspecified.
  - name: eventId
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer identifying the specific guild event type.
      This value corresponds to predefined event types within the TrinityCore guild
      system and determines how timing coordination is handled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Timing Coordination
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateEventTiming(&playerId, 1001);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Coordination with Null Player Pointer
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.CoordinateEventTiming(nullptr, 1002);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger guild event management system and
    may interact with server-side timers or scheduling mechanisms. It's designed to
    be thread-safe as it operates within the TrinityCore core systems where concurrency
    is common.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'player' parameter may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always ensure valid player identifiers are provided when calling this
    method in production code.
