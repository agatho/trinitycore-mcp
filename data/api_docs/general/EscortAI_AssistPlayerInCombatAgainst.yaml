  class: EscortAI
  method: AssistPlayerInCombatAgainst
  signature: bool EscortAI::AssistPlayerInCombatAgainst(int * who)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates combat assistance for a player against a specified enemy.
  description: The AssistPlayerInCombatAgainst method is used by EscortAI to engage
    in combat on behalf of a player character. It takes an integer pointer parameter
    that represents the target enemy to fight against. This method typically gets
    invoked when the escorted player enters combat, and the AI unit should assist
    them by attacking the specified opponent. The method returns true if the assistance
    was successfully initiated, or false if it failed due to invalid parameters or
    other conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target enemy ID or GUID that
      the AI should assist the player in fighting against. This value must be a valid
      identifier for a creature or unit in the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the combat assistance was successfully initiated and the
    AI started attacking the specified enemy, false otherwise. A return of false may
    indicate invalid input, inability to locate the target, or other failure conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in an escort quest
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player, Unit* enemy)\n{\n    if (escortAI)\n\
      \    {\n        int enemyId = enemy->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n        if (!escortAI->AssistPlayerInCombatAgainst(&enemyId))\n\
      \        {\n            // Handle failure case\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EscortAI class which is commonly used for NPC
    quest escorts in World of Warcraft. The 'who' parameter should point to a valid
    enemy unit that exists in the current map or instance. The AI will attempt to
    attack this target until either the target dies, flees, or the player leaves combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the integer pointed to by 'who' is a valid and existing unit
    ID before calling this method. Passing an invalid or null pointer may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Also note that this method does not check if the
    AI unit is already engaged in combat with another target.
