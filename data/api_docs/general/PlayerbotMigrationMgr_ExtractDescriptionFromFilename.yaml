  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: ExtractDescriptionFromFilename
  signature: std::string PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ExtractDescriptionFromFilename(const
    std::string & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Extracts a descriptive string from a given filename, typically used for player
    bot migration data files.
  description: The ExtractDescriptionFromFilename method processes a provided filename
    string to extract and return a human-readable description associated with it.
    This is commonly used in the context of player bot migration systems where filenames
    contain metadata about bot configurations or saved states. The method likely parses
    specific patterns within the filename to isolate meaningful information such as
    character names, timestamps, or configuration identifiers. It's designed to handle
    various filename formats that may be generated during bot migration processes
    and returns a clean, descriptive string for use in UI elements or logging systems.
  parameters:
  - name: filename
    description: The full path or name of the file from which to extract the description.
      This should be a valid string representing a file path or filename that contains
      structured data.
  returns: A std::string containing the extracted description from the filename. If
    no recognizable pattern is found, it may return an empty string or the original
    filename unchanged.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with a typical migration filename
    code: 'PlayerbotMigrationMgr migrationMgr;

      std::string desc = migrationMgr.ExtractDescriptionFromFilename("playerbot_1234567890_charname_save.xml");

      // Returns "charname" or similar descriptive text'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the extracted description in a logging context
    code: 'PlayerbotMigrationMgr migrationMgr;

      std::string filename = "playerbot_20231201_145530_magebot_backup.json";

      std::string desc = migrationMgr.ExtractDescriptionFromFilename(filename);

      TC_LOG_INFO("playerbots", "Processing migration for: %s", desc.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using string parsing techniques such as
    substring extraction, regular expressions, or pattern matching to identify and
    isolate descriptive components from filenames. It assumes that the input filename
    follows a consistent naming convention used by player bot migration utilities.
  warnings: The behavior of this method may vary depending on the exact format of
    the input filename. If filenames do not follow expected patterns, unexpected results
    might occur. Ensure that all filenames passed to this method are properly formatted
    for reliable extraction.
