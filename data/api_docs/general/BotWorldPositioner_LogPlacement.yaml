  class: BotWorldPositioner
  method: LogPlacement
  signature: void BotWorldPositioner::LogPlacement(Player * bot, const ZonePlacement
    * placement)
documentation:
  brief: Logs the placement information of a bot within a specific zone.
  description: The LogPlacement method records or outputs the positional data of a
    bot player within a designated zone. This functionality is typically used in automated
    bot systems to track and manage where bots are positioned, aiding in scenario
    simulation, testing, or gameplay mechanics that require precise location tracking.
    The method takes a pointer to the bot player and a zone placement structure containing
    relevant coordinate and zone information.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose placement
      is being logged.
  - name: placement
    description: Pointer to a ZonePlacement structure containing the bot's current
      zone and positional data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      ZonePlacement placement;

      placement.zoneId = 1234;

      placement.x = 100.0f;

      placement.y = 200.0f;

      placement.z = 50.0f;

      botWorldPositioner.LogPlacement(myBot, &placement);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other bot management systems
    to maintain accurate tracking of bot positions across zones. It may be called
    frequently during gameplay or simulation, so performance considerations should
    be taken into account when logging large volumes of data.
