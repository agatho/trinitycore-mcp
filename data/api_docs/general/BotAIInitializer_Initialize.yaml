  class: BotAIInitializer
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotAIInitializer::Initialize(const BotAIConfig & config, InitCallback
    callback)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the BotAI system with provided configuration and callback.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the BotAI system by applying the given
    configuration parameters and registering a callback function for initialization
    events. This method prepares the AI subsystem for bot operations, ensuring that
    all necessary resources are allocated and configured according to the specified
    settings. The callback function allows the system to notify the caller when initialization
    is complete or if any errors occur during setup.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: Reference to a BotAIConfig object containing configuration parameters
      for the AI system. This includes settings such as behavior patterns, decision-making
      thresholds, and resource allocation rules.
  - name: callback
    description: A callback function of type InitCallback that will be invoked upon
      completion or failure of initialization. The callback receives information about
      the initialization status and can be used to handle asynchronous operations
      or error reporting.
  returns: Returns true if the initialization process was successful and all components
    were properly configured; otherwise returns false, indicating a failure in setup
    or configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic BotAI Initialization
    code: "BotAIConfig config;\nconfig.SetBehavior(BotBehavior::Aggressive);\nconfig.SetDecisionThreshold(0.7f);\n\
      \nbool success = botAIInitializer.Initialize(config, [](bool result) {\n   \
      \ if (result) {\n        std::cout << \"BotAI initialized successfully\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"BotAI initialization failed\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n    }\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any bot AI operations are performed.
    It is recommended to check the return value and handle potential errors appropriately.
    The callback mechanism allows for non-blocking initialization in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may lead to
    resource leaks or undefined behavior. Ensure that all previous bot instances are
    properly shut down before reinitializing.
