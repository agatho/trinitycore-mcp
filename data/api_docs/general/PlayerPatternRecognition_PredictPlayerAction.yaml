  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: PredictPlayerAction
  signature: PredictionResult PlayerPatternRecognition::PredictPlayerAction(Player
    * player, float timeHorizon)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the next likely action a player will take based on observed behavior
    patterns and timing data.
  description: The PredictPlayerAction method analyzes a given player's historical
    movement, interaction, and behavioral patterns to estimate their most probable
    future action within a specified time horizon. This functionality is typically
    used in AI-driven systems or game mechanics that require anticipating player behavior
    for NPC decision-making, quest progression, or dynamic difficulty adjustment.
    The prediction considers various factors such as recent actions, movement speed,
    direction changes, and interaction frequency. It's important to note that this
    method requires sufficient historical data to make accurate predictions; sparse
    or inconsistent player behavior may result in less reliable outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose actions are being predicted.
      Must not be null.
  - name: timeHorizon
    description: The time window (in seconds) over which the prediction is made. Should
      be a positive float value representing how far into the future the action is
      being predicted.
  returns: Returns a PredictionResult object containing the predicted action type
    and associated confidence level. The result may indicate a specific action such
    as movement, casting, interaction, or inactivity, along with a probability score
    between 0.0 (least likely) and 1.0 (most likely).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nfloat timeWindow\
      \ = 5.0f;\nPredictionResult prediction = patternRecognizer->PredictPlayerAction(targetPlayer,\
      \ timeWindow);\nif (prediction.actionType != ACTION_NONE)\n{\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Predicted action: \" << prediction.actionType << \" with confidence \"\
      \ << prediction.confidence << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfloat timeHorizon = 10.0f;\nPredictionResult result\
      \ = patternRecognizer->PredictPlayerAction(player, timeHorizon);\n\nswitch (result.actionType)\n\
      {\n    case ACTION_MOVE:\n        // Adjust NPC movement or positioning\n  \
      \      break;\n    case ACTION_CAST:\n        // Prepare for spell interruption\
      \ or counter-action\n        break;\n    case ACTION_INTERACT:\n        // Initiate\
      \ dialogue or quest progression\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle\
      \ unknown or low-confidence predictions\n        break;\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal pattern recognition algorithms that may require
    a minimum amount of player data to function effectively. Performance can be impacted
    by the complexity of the pattern database and the number of concurrent players
    being analyzed. The prediction accuracy improves with more consistent player behavior
    over time.
  warnings: Do not assume that predicted actions will always occur as expected; player
    behavior can change unexpectedly, especially in dynamic or unpredictable environments.
    Always validate predictions against actual player state before taking critical
    actions based on them.
