  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: CanStartFarming
  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::CanStartFarming(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can begin farming activities within the game
    world.
  description: The CanStartFarming method evaluates if a specified player is eligible
    to initiate farming operations. This includes checking various conditions such
    as player state, location restrictions, resource availability, and game rules
    that govern when farming can commence. The method typically ensures that players
    are not in combat, are in valid zones, and meet prerequisite requirements before
    allowing them to start farming. It serves as a gatekeeping function to maintain
    game balance and prevent inappropriate use of farming mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object that is being evaluated for farming
      eligibility. This parameter represents the specific player instance attempting
      to start farming activities.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all conditions required to begin farming,
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false may indicate the player is in
    combat, not in a valid zone, or lacks necessary prerequisites for farming.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage check
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player instance\nif (farmingCoordinator->CanStartFarming(player))\
      \ {\n    // Player can start farming\n    player->StartFarming();\n} else {\n\
      \    // Player cannot farm at this time\n    player->SendNotification(\"You\
      \ cannot start farming right now.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with farming system
    code: "void HandlePlayerFarmingCommand(Player* player) {\n    if (farmingCoordinator->CanStartFarming(player))\
      \ {\n        // Check for inventory space\n        if (player->GetItemCount(ITEM_FARMING_TOOL)\
      \ > 0) {\n            player->StartFarming();\n        } else {\n          \
      \  player->SendNotification(\"You need a farming tool to begin.\");\n      \
      \  }\n    } else {\n        player->SendNotification(\"You cannot start farming\
      \ at this moment.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs multiple checks including combat state, zone
    restrictions, and player status flags. It's designed to be lightweight for frequent
    calls during gameplay but may involve database lookups or complex condition evaluations
    depending on implementation details.
  warnings: The parameter 'player' must not be null; calling this method with a null
    pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation
    before invoking the method.
