  class: DependencyValidator
  method: GetBoostVersion
  signature: std::string DependencyValidator::GetBoostVersion()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the version string of the Boost library currently linked with the
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The GetBoostVersion method returns a string representation of the Boost
    library version that is being used by the TrinityCore server. This function is
    typically utilized during system initialization or diagnostic checks to verify
    compatibility between the server and its dependencies. The returned version string
    follows standard semantic versioning conventions (e.g., '1.75.0') and can be used
    for logging, debugging, or automated dependency validation processes. This method
    does not require any parameters and will always return a valid version string
    if Boost is properly linked.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the version of the Boost library currently in
    use by the TrinityCore server, formatted as a semantic version (e.g., '1.75.0').
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Logging
    code: "#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    DependencyValidator validator;\n\
      \    std::string boostVersion = validator.GetBoostVersion();\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Boost version: \" << boostVersion << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup to log dependency versions
    for debugging purposes. The implementation relies on Boost's preprocessor macros
    to determine the version at compile time, so it will reflect the version of Boost
    used when the server was compiled rather than potentially runtime-loaded libraries.
