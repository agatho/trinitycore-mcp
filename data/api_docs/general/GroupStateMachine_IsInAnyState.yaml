  class: GroupStateMachine
  method: IsInAnyState
  signature: bool GroupStateMachine::IsInAnyState(const int & states) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the group state machine is currently in any of the specified states.
  description: "The IsInAnyState method determines whether the current group state\
    \ machine instance is currently\u5904\u4E8E one or more of the provided state\
    \ flags. This method evaluates the internal state bitmask against the input state\
    \ mask to return a boolean result indicating match. It's commonly used in group\
    \ management systems to check for specific group states such as being in a raid,\
    \ party, or combat state. The method performs a bitwise AND operation between\
    \ the current internal state and the provided state mask, returning true if any\
    \ bits match."
  parameters:
  - name: states
    description: A bitmask representing one or more group states to check against.
      This parameter should contain the state flags that define which states are being
      queried. The value is typically a combination of predefined state constants
      using bitwise OR operations.
  returns: Returns true if the group state machine is currently in any of the specified
    states, false otherwise. If no matching bits are found between the internal state
    and the provided state mask, the method returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Check
    code: "if (groupStateMachine.IsInAnyState(GROUP_STATE_IN_RAID | GROUP_STATE_IN_PARTY))\
      \ {\n    // Group is either in a raid or party\n    std::cout << \"Group is\
      \ in a raid or party\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat State Check
    code: "if (groupStateMachine.IsInAnyState(GROUP_STATE_IN_COMBAT | GROUP_STATE_IN_DUNGEON))\
      \ {\n    // Group is either in combat or dungeon\n    HandleGroupCombatState();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a bitwise operation which makes it efficient for checking
    multiple states simultaneously. The internal state representation should be treated
    as an opaque bitmask, and developers should rely on predefined constants rather
    than hardcoding values. The method assumes that the state mask passed in is valid
    and represents a meaningful combination of group states.
  warnings: Be cautious when combining state flags, as incorrect combinations may
    lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that all state constants used are properly
    defined and compatible with the current implementation. This method does not validate
    the input state mask, so invalid values could cause undefined behavior.
