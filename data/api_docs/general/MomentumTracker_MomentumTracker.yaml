  class: MomentumTracker
  method: MomentumTracker
  signature: void MomentumTracker::MomentumTracker(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a MomentumTracker instance for the specified player bot.
  description: The MomentumTracker constructor initializes internal tracking data
    structures for a given player bot. This method sets up the necessary state to
    monitor and manage momentum-related mechanics for the bot, such as movement speed
    adjustments, ability cooldowns, or combat positioning behaviors. The initialization
    typically occurs during the bot's creation or activation phase within the TrinityCore
    AI framework. This constructor does not perform any complex operations but prepares
    the object for subsequent method calls that manipulate momentum state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this MomentumTracker
      will monitor and manage. Must be a valid player instance; passing nullptr may
      result in undefined behavior or runtime errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      MomentumTracker tracker(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked internally by the AI system when creating
    or assigning momentum tracking to a bot. Developers should ensure that the Player
    pointer passed is valid and initialized before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the constructor may lead to crashes or memory
    corruption. Always verify that the player object exists and is properly initialized
    before constructing a MomentumTracker.
