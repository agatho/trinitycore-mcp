  method: IsNeutralToAll
  signature: bool FactionTemplateEntry::IsNeutralToAll() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the faction template considers all other factions as neutral.
  description: The IsNeutralToAll method checks if the current faction template has
    a configuration where it is considered neutral toward all other factions in the
    game. This typically means that the faction will not engage in combat with any
    other faction unless provoked or specific conditions are met. It's commonly used
    in game logic to determine interaction behavior between NPCs and players, or between
    different NPC factions. The method returns true if the faction template is set
    up to be neutral to all other factions, and false otherwise. This setting can
    affect how creatures behave in combat, quest interactions, and general NPC hostility.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the faction template is configured to be neutral to all
    other factions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Faction is Neutral to All
    code: "FactionTemplateEntry* factionEntry = sFactionTemplateStore.LookupEntry(1234);\n\
      if (factionEntry && factionEntry->IsNeutralToAll()) {\n    // This faction is\
      \ neutral to all others\n    printf(\"Faction is neutral to all other factions\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or configuration values within the
    FactionTemplateEntry structure. It's commonly used in AI decision-making systems
    for NPCs to determine whether they should engage in combat with other factions.
