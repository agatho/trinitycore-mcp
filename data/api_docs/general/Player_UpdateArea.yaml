documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's current area ID and triggers relevant area-based events
    and updates.
  description: The UpdateArea method is responsible for updating a player's current
    area identifier within the game world. This method is typically invoked when a
    player moves from one geographical area to another, ensuring that the player's
    area-specific data is synchronized with their new location. It may trigger area-based
    events such as quest updates, zone-specific buffs, or other mechanics dependent
    on the player's current area. The method handles internal state management for
    area-related systems and ensures consistency between the player's position and
    their associated area data.
  parameters:
  - name: newArea
    description: The new area ID that the player is entering. This value should correspond
      to a valid area identifier defined in the game's area table, typically matching
      the AreaID field in the AreaTable.dbc file.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Player Area During Movement
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 newAreaId = 1234; // Example area ID

      player->UpdateArea(newAreaId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Area Update with Conditional Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 currentArea = player->GetAreaId();\nuint32\
      \ newArea = GetNewAreaForPlayer(player);\n\nif (currentArea != newArea)\n{\n\
      \    player->UpdateArea(newArea);\n    // Additional logic for area transition\
      \ effects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core when a player's position
    changes significantly. Developers should be aware that calling this method directly
    may bypass normal movement validation and could lead to unexpected behavior if
    not used carefully. The method may also trigger internal callbacks or event handlers
    related to area transitions.
  warnings: Directly calling UpdateArea without proper validation may cause inconsistencies
    in the player's state or trigger unintended game events. It is recommended to
    use this method only when absolutely necessary and after ensuring that the new
    area ID is valid and appropriate for the player's current context.
