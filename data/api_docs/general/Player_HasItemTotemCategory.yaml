  description: This method determines whether the player possesses any items that
    are linked to a particular TotemCategory. It is commonly used in conjunction with
    Totem-related gameplay mechanics, such as checking for the presence of Totem items
    or validating Totem category requirements. The method evaluates the player's inventory
    and equipped items to see if any item matches the specified TotemCategory. This
    functionality is essential for determining whether a player can use certain Totem-based
    abilities or spells.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (player->HasItemTotemCategory(1)) {\n    // Player has items with TotemCategory\
      \ 1\n    // Perform actions related to TotemCategory 1\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other Totem-related functions,
    such as checking for specific Totem items or validating Totem category requirements.
    It may be invoked during spell validation or when checking player's inventory
    for Totem-related items.
  warnings: Be aware that this method does not distinguish between different types
    of Totem items; it simply checks if any item exists with the specified TotemCategory.
    This can lead to false positives if multiple items share the same category but
    are not actually related to Totems.
