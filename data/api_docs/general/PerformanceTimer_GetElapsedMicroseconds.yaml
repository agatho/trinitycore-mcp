  class: PerformanceTimer
  method: GetElapsedMicroseconds
  signature: uint64_t PerformanceTimer::GetElapsedMicroseconds() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the elapsed time in microseconds since the performance
    timer was started.
  description: The GetElapsedMicroseconds method computes the total time that has
    passed since the PerformanceTimer object was initialized or last reset. This method
    is commonly used for profiling, timing game events, or measuring performance of
    specific code sections. The returned value represents a 64-bit unsigned integer
    indicating microseconds elapsed. It's important to note that this timer typically
    uses high-resolution system clocks for accurate measurements, making it suitable
    for performance-critical applications within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    does not modify the internal state of the timer and can be called multiple times
    to check progress or final duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64_t value representing the number of microseconds that have elapsed
    since the timer was started. Returns zero if the timer has not been initialized
    or reset.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Usage
    code: 'PerformanceTimer timer;

      // ... some code execution ...

      uint64_t elapsed = timer.GetElapsedMicroseconds();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server", "Execution took {} microseconds", elapsed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Profiling Example
    code: "void SomeGameFunction() {\n    PerformanceTimer profiler;\n    // ... perform\
      \ game logic ...\n    uint64_t time_taken = profiler.GetElapsedMicroseconds();\n\
      \    if (time_taken > 1000) // 1ms threshold\n        TC_LOG_WARN(\"server\"\
      , \"Slow function execution: {} microseconds\", time_taken);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on system-level high-resolution timers for accuracy. The
    timer's precision may vary depending on the underlying platform and operating
    system capabilities. In TrinityCore, such timers are often used in conjunction
    with logging systems to monitor performance bottlenecks or to enforce time limits
    on certain operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceTimer object is properly initialized before
    calling this method; otherwise, unexpected results may occur. While this method
    is thread-safe in most implementations, be cautious when using shared timer instances
    across multiple threads without proper synchronization.
