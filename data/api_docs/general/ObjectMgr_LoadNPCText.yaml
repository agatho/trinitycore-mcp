  brief: Loads and initializes all NPC text entries from the database into memory
    for use in World of Warcraft conversations.
  description: The LoadNPCText method is responsible for loading all NPC text data
    from the database tables into memory during server startup or reload operations.
    This method populates internal data structures that store quest texts, gossip
    options, and other dialogue content associated with NPCs. It ensures that when
    players interact with NPCs, the appropriate text responses are available for display.
    The method typically runs during the object manager initialization phase and processes
    all entries in the npc_text table, associating them with their respective NPC
    entries. This data is crucial for proper NPC interaction mechanics within the
    game world.

      \    // NPC texts are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when reloading NPC
    data. It performs database queries to fetch all NPC text entries and stores them
    in memory for fast access during player-NPC interactions. The method may be invoked
    multiple times during runtime if NPC data needs to be refreshed.
