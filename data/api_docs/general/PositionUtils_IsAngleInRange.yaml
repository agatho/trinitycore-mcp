  class: PositionUtils
  method: IsAngleInRange
  signature: bool PositionUtils::IsAngleInRange(float angle, float target, float tolerance)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given angle falls within a specified tolerance range
    of a target angle.
  description: The IsAngleInRange method evaluates if a provided angle lies within
    a defined angular tolerance of a target angle. This is commonly used in game mechanics
    such as determining if an enemy is within the field of view of a character or
    if a spell's targeting direction aligns with a desired orientation. The method
    handles angle wrapping, ensuring that angles near 0 and 360 degrees are correctly
    compared. It performs a circular comparison, making it suitable for directional
    checks in 2D space where angular relationships matter.
  parameters:
  - name: angle
    description: The angle to be tested, measured in radians or degrees depending
      on the system's convention. Should be within the range [0, 2*PI) or [0, 360)
      for proper wrapping behavior.
  - name: target
    description: The reference angle against which the test is performed, also in
      radians or degrees. This represents the center of the acceptable angular range.
  - name: tolerance
    description: The allowable deviation from the target angle, defining the half-width
      of the angular range. Must be non-negative and less than or equal to PI (or
      180 degrees) for valid results.
  returns: Returns true if the specified angle falls within the tolerance range around
    the target angle; otherwise returns false. The comparison accounts for circular
    nature of angles, allowing seamless transitions across 0/360 degree boundaries.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: bool result = PositionUtils::IsAngleInRange(1.57f, 3.14f, 0.5f); // Checks
      if 1.57 radians is within 0.5 radians of 3.14 radians (pi)
    language: cpp
  - title: Field of View Check
    code: 'float playerFacing = unit->GetOrientation();

      float enemyFacing = unit->GetAngle(enemy);

      bool inView = PositionUtils::IsAngleInRange(enemyFacing, playerFacing, M_PI
      / 4); // Checks if enemy is within 45-degree field of view'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that all angles are normalized to a consistent unit (either
    radians or degrees) and handles angle wrapping internally. It's optimized for
    performance in real-time game systems where frequent directional checks occur.
  warnings: Ensure that the tolerance value does not exceed PI (or 180 degrees), as
    this may lead to unexpected behavior due to the circular nature of angular comparisons.
    Also, be cautious when using large tolerance values near 0/360 degree boundaries.
