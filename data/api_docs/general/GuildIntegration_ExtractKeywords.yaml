  brief: Extracts and processes keywords from a guild message for integration purposes
  description: The ExtractKeywords method analyzes a given guild message string to
    identify and extract relevant keywords that can be used for various guild-related
    integrations, such as filtering, categorization, or automated responses. This
    method is typically invoked when processing guild chat messages to determine their
    content type or to trigger specific actions based on keyword matching. The extracted
    keywords are processed according to predefined rules and may be stored or forwarded
    to other systems within the TrinityCore framework. The method assumes that the
    input message has already been validated for proper formatting and encoding.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the number of keywords successfully
    extracted from the message, or a negative value if an error occurs during processing.
    A return value of zero indicates no keywords were found, while positive values
    indicate successful extraction of one or more keywords.
  examples:
  - title: Basic keyword extraction
    code: "GuildIntegration guildInt;\nstd::string message = \"Guild meeting at 7\
      \ PM tonight\";\nint keywordCount = guildInt.ExtractKeywords(message);\nif (keywordCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << keywordCount << \" keywords\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and efficient for real-time guild
    chat processing. It may cache previously processed messages or keywords for performance
    optimization in high-frequency scenarios. The exact keyword extraction logic depends
    on the internal configuration of the GuildIntegration class and may vary based
    on server settings.
  warnings: The method does not validate input message format beyond basic string
    handling, so malformed messages could lead to unexpected results. Ensure that
    the message parameter contains valid UTF-8 encoded text before calling this method
    to prevent encoding-related errors.
