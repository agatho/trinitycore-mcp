  class: ChiSystem
  method: Regenerate
  signature: void ChiSystem::Regenerate(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates chi energy for the player character.
  description: The Regenerate method is responsible for restoring chi energy to a
    player character within the ChiSystem. This method typically gets invoked during
    specific game events, such as resting, meditating, or when certain abilities are
    used. It updates the internal chi energy state of the character, potentially increasing
    the chi pool up to its maximum capacity. The regeneration process may be influenced
    by factors like character level, class specialization, equipped items, and active
    buffs or debuffs.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer parameter that likely represents the amount
      of chi to regenerate or a flag indicating regeneration type. The exact meaning
      depends on internal implementation details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Chi Regeneration
    code: 'ChiSystem* chiSys = player->GetChiSystem();

      chiSys->Regenerate(50); // Regenerates 50 units of chi energy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Regeneration on Rest
    code: "void Player::HandleRest() {\n    // ... other rest logic ...\n    if (GetChiSystem())\
      \ {\n        GetChiSystem()->Regenerate(100);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from game loop or event handlers. It's important
    to ensure that chi regeneration does not exceed the maximum chi capacity of the
    character. The param0 value might be used to determine how much chi should be
    regenerated, possibly acting as a multiplier or fixed amount.
  warnings: Calling Regenerate with an invalid parameter value could lead to unexpected
    behavior or overflow in chi energy values. Ensure that the system properly validates
    input parameters before processing.
