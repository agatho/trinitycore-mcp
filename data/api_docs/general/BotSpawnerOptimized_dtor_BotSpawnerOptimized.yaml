  class: BotSpawnerOptimized
  method: ~BotSpawnerOptimized
  signature: void BotSpawnerOptimized::~BotSpawnerOptimized()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotSpawnerOptimized instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSpawnerOptimized class is responsible for
    releasing all dynamically allocated memory and cleaning up any internal resources
    that were initialized during object construction. This includes deallocating memory
    used for bot data structures, clearing internal lists or maps of spawned bots,
    and ensuring no memory leaks occur when the spawner instance is destroyed. The
    destructor ensures proper cleanup of bot-related data to maintain system stability
    and prevent resource exhaustion in long-running server environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSpawnerOptimized instance
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized* spawner = new BotSpawnerOptimized();

      // ... use the spawner ...

      delete spawner; // Destructor is automatically called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only when the BotSpawnerOptimized instance
    is no longer needed. It's important to ensure that all references to spawned bots
    are properly managed before destruction to avoid dangling pointers or access violations.
