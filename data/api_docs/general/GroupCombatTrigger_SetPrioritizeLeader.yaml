  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: SetPrioritizeLeader
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::SetPrioritizeLeader(bool prioritize)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the group's leader should be prioritized during combat trigger
    events.
  description: The SetPrioritizeLeader method configures the GroupCombatTrigger class
    to prioritize the group leader when determining target selection or behavior during
    combat scenarios. This setting affects how the trigger evaluates potential targets
    and can influence the overall combat strategy of the group. The method does not
    validate whether the group has a leader, but will apply the setting regardless.
    When enabled, the group leader's actions or status may take precedence over other
    group members during combat events.
  parameters:
  - name: prioritize
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to prioritize the group leader.
      True enables prioritization, false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable leader prioritization
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      trigger.SetPrioritizeLeader(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable leader prioritization
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      trigger.SetPrioritizeLeader(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other combat trigger settings
    to customize group behavior during encounters. The setting persists until explicitly
    changed, and affects all subsequent combat events triggered by this instance.
