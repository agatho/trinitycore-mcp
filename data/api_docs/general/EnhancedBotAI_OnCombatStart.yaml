  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: OnCombatStart
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::OnCombatStart(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes combat behavior when a bot enters combat with a target unit
  description: The OnCombatStart method is invoked when an EnhancedBotAI instance
    begins combat with a specified target unit. This method handles the initial setup
    and behavior configuration for the bot's combat state, including initializing
    combat-related timers, setting up target tracking, and preparing the bot's AI
    decision-making process for engaged combat. The method is typically called by
    the TrinityCore framework when a bot's combat state transitions from idle to active.
    It may also perform necessary initialization of combat-specific data structures
    or flags required for proper bot behavior during battle.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target the bot is engaging
      in combat. This parameter cannot be null and must point to a valid unit object
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic combat start handling
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::OnCombatStart(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target)\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Initialize combat state\n    m_combatStartTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    m_targetGuid = target->GetGUID();\n    \n    // Begin\
      \ combat-specific AI logic\n    StartCombatBehavior();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI lifecycle and should not be overridden
    lightly. The target parameter is guaranteed to be valid when this method is called,
    as it's invoked only after successful combat initiation. Implementation should
    avoid heavy computations that could block the game loop.
  warnings: Do not assume the target remains valid throughout the combat duration
    without proper checking. The method may be called multiple times during a single
    combat session if the bot switches targets.
