documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of summons in the SummonList.
  description: The size() method returns the total count of summoned creatures or
    game objects currently stored within the SummonList. This method is commonly used
    in AI scripts and spell effects to determine how many summons are active for a
    given summoner. The returned value represents the current size of the internal
    container holding the summons, which can be useful for loop iterations, conditional
    checks, or managing summon-related logic. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment,
    this method is typically called on SummonList objects that manage summoned creatures
    such as pets, guardians, or temporary summoned NPCs.
  parameters: []
  returns: The number of summons currently contained in the SummonList as a size_type
    (typically std::size_t). Returns zero if the list is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check summon count
    code: "if (summonList.size() > 0)\n{\n    // Perform actions based on active summons\n\
      \    for (auto& summon : summonList)\n    {\n        // Process each summon\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using size() in AI logic
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (summonList.size() < 3)\n        {\n         \
      \   // Summon additional creatures if needed\n            DoSummon(SUMMON_TYPE_CREATURE,\
      \ 1);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The size() method performs a constant-time operation (O(1)) as it typically
    returns the cached count of elements in the container. The SummonList class likely
    uses an internal container such as std::vector or similar STL container, making
    this operation efficient. This method does not modify the SummonList contents
    and is safe to call from any context.
