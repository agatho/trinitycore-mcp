documentation:
  brief: Adds a loot mode to the creature's loot list.
  description: This method adds a specified loot mode to the creature's loot list,
    allowing for different loot modes to be applied to the same creature. The loot
    mode determines which loot table is used when the creature is looted. This method
    is typically used in conjunction with other loot-related methods to manage creature
    loot behavior and ensure proper loot distribution according to game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->AddLootMode(1);

      // This adds loot mode 1 to the creature''s loot list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's loot management system and should be
    used carefully when modifying loot behavior. It's important to understand that
    adding a loot mode does not automatically trigger loot generation, but rather
    prepares the creature for potential loot distribution based on the specified mode.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot distribution or
    missing loot items. Care should be taken when applying multiple loot modes to
    ensure proper game balance and player experience.
