  method: PruneInactiveZones
  signature: void SpatialHostileCache::PruneInactiveZones()
documentation:
  brief: Removes stale hostile unit references from inactive zones in the spatial
    cache.
  description: The PruneInactiveZones method cleans up the SpatialHostileCache by
    removing entries for hostile units that are no longer relevant due to their associated
    zones becoming inactive. This process helps maintain performance and memory efficiency
    by eliminating outdated data that would not be used in current gameplay scenarios.
    The method typically runs periodically as part of the game's spatial awareness
    system to ensure that only currently active and relevant hostile unit information
    is retained in memory.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpatialHostileCache cache;

      cache.PruneInactiveZones();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the game engine's update
    loop or spatial management system. It's important to note that pruning occurs
    based on zone activity status rather than individual unit states, so units may
    be removed even if they are still present in the world but in inactive zones.
