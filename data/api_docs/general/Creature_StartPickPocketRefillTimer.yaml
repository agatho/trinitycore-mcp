  signature: void Creature::StartPickPocketRefillTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Starts the timer for replenishing pickpocket loot on a creature.
  description: This method initiates the process of refilling the pickpocket loot
    table for a creature, typically used after a player has successfully pickpocketed
    the creature. It resets the timer that determines when the creature will be able
    to be pickpocketed again, allowing for proper game mechanics implementation where
    players can only pickpocket once per time period. The method is part of the creature's
    internal state management and ensures that loot remains available for subsequent
    pickpocket attempts.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->StartPickPocketRefillTimer();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    a player successfully pickpockets a creature. It should not be invoked directly
    unless explicitly required by custom scripts or modifications to game behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect loot availability or
    game mechanics issues, particularly if used outside of proper context. Ensure
    that the creature's state is properly managed before calling this method.
