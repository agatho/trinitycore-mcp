  signature: float InterruptUtils::GetSpellDangerRating(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the danger rating of a spell based on its interrupt
    potential and mechanics.
  description: The GetSpellDangerRating method evaluates the danger level of a specified
    spell by analyzing its interrupt properties, cast time, and other relevant combat
    mechanics. This value is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to determine
    how dangerous a spell is for interrupting or countering in PvP and PvE scenarios.
    The method performs a lookup in internal spell databases and applies various multipliers
    and thresholds to compute a normalized float value representing the spell's danger
    rating. The returned value typically ranges from 0.0 (least dangerous) to 1.0
    (most dangerous), though values may exceed 1.0 for exceptionally threatening spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated danger rating of the spell. Values
    typically range from 0.0 to 1.0, where higher values indicate more dangerous spells
    with greater interrupt potential or threat level. Returns 0.0 if the spell ID
    is invalid or not found in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float dangerRating = InterruptUtils::GetSpellDangerRating(12345); // Gets\
      \ danger rating for spell ID 12345\nif (dangerRating > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Spell\
      \ is considered highly dangerous\n    // Implement special handling or warnings\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Combat Logic
    code: "uint32 spellId = player->GetCurrentSpellCast()->m_spellInfo->Id;\nfloat\
      \ dangerRating = InterruptUtils::GetSpellDangerRating(spellId);\nif (dangerRating\
      \ >= 0.8f)\n{\n    // This spell is extremely dangerous, consider delaying interrupt\n\
      \    // or using a more powerful interrupt ability\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell databases and configurations that may
    vary between different TrinityCore builds or custom modifications. The exact calculation
    algorithm is not exposed in the public API, but it likely incorporates factors
    such as spell duration, interrupt resistance, and combat impact. For performance-critical
    applications, caching results of this function for frequently checked spells is
    recommended.
  warnings: The method assumes valid spell IDs are passed; invalid or non-existent
    spell IDs will return 0.0. Do not rely on exact numerical values for precise game
    logic decisions as the rating system may change between core versions. The returned
    value should be treated as a relative measure rather than an absolute threat level.
