documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldowns for the Guardian Druid's abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the cooldown timers of all applicable abilities for a Guardian Druid. This method
    is typically called during the AI update cycle to ensure that abilities are properly
    tracked and made available when their cooldown periods have expired. It handles
    internal state management for ability readiness and ensures proper synchronization
    with the game's timing system. The method processes each ability's cooldown status
    based on the elapsed time since the last update, allowing for accurate tracking
    of when abilities can be used again.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void GuardianDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    m_guardian->UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to maintain
    accurate cooldown tracking. It is typically invoked with the time difference (diff)
    parameter from the main game loop, which represents milliseconds elapsed since
    the last update. The implementation likely uses internal timers or counters to
    track when each ability's cooldown expires.
