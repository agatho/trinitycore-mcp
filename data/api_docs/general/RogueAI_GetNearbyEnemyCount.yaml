  class: RogueAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: uint32 RogueAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the specified range of the
    rogue AI's owner. This method is typically used for decision-making in combat
    behavior, such as determining whether to use stealth abilities or initiate an
    attack. The range parameter defines the maximum distance at which enemies are
    considered 'nearby'. Enemies are counted based on their current position relative
    to the AI's owner and their hostility status. This method does not modify any
    internal state and is read-only.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance in yards within which enemy units will be counted.
      Must be a positive value; negative or zero values may produce unexpected results.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the total count of hostile units found within
    the specified range. A return value of 0 indicates no enemies are within range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 enemyCount = rogueAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Enemy Count
    code: "if (rogueAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(5.0f) > 2)\n{\n    // Use area-of-effect\
      \ ability\n    rogueAI->UseAbility(AbilityType::BladeFlurry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's internal knowledge of nearby units and their
    hostility status. It may not account for units that are invisible or have stealth
    abilities unless those are properly detected by the AI system. Performance is
    generally efficient as it uses spatial queries, but frequent calls with small
    ranges could impact performance in high-density environments.
  warnings: Ensure that the range value passed is appropriate for gameplay balance;
    extremely large ranges may cause performance issues or unintended behavior. The
    method assumes that all enemies within range are hostile and does not distinguish
    between different types of hostility (e.g., neutral vs. aggressive).
