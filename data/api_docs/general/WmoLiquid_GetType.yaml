documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the type identifier of the WMO liquid.
  description: The GetType method returns the type identifier associated with a WmoLiquid
    object. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, WmoLiquid represents
    liquid data within WMO (World Map Object) files, which define terrain features
    like water bodies or lava pools. This type identifier typically corresponds to
    predefined liquid types such as water, lava, or magma, and is used by the game
    engine to determine rendering behavior, collision detection, and interaction properties
    for the liquid. The method provides a constant-time lookup of this type without
    modifying internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the type identifier of the WMO liquid. Common
    values may include identifiers for water (e.g., 0), lava (e.g., 1), or other liquid
    types defined in the game's liquid type definitions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "WmoLiquid* liquid = GetWmoLiquid();\nuint32 type = liquid->GetType();\n\
      if (type == 0)\n{\n    // Handle water\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining Liquid Behavior
    code: "WmoLiquid* liquid = GetWmoLiquid();\nuint32 type = liquid->GetType();\n\
      switch (type)\n{\n    case 0: // Water\n        // Apply water-specific logic\n\
      \        break;\n    case 1: // Lava\n        // Apply lava-specific logic\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle unknown liquid type\n     \
      \   break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that does not perform any computation or I/O
    operations. It directly accesses a cached or stored value within the WmoLiquid
    object, making it highly efficient for frequent calls during gameplay rendering
    or physics calculations.
