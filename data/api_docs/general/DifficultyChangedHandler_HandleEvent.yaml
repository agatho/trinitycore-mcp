  class: DifficultyChangedHandler
  method: HandleEvent
  signature: bool DifficultyChangedHandler::HandleEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Handles group difficulty change events and returns true if the event was
    successfully processed.
  description: The DifficultyChangedHandler::HandleEvent method processes group difficulty
    change events within the TrinityCore framework. This method is invoked when a
    player's group difficulty level changes, such as when entering a dungeon or raid
    with a different difficulty setting. The handler updates relevant game state information
    and ensures that all group members are properly notified of the change. It performs
    validation checks to ensure the event is valid before processing and returns true
    upon successful handling, or false if the event could not be processed due to
    invalid parameters or other issues.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A constant reference to a GroupEvent object containing details about
      the difficulty change event. This includes information such as the group ID,
      old difficulty level, new difficulty level, and associated player data.
  returns: Returns true if the difficulty change event was successfully processed
    and all necessary updates were made; returns false if the event could not be processed
    due to invalid parameters or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DifficultyChangedHandler::HandleEvent
    code: "DifficultyChangedHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\nevent.groupId = 12345;\n\
      event.oldDifficulty = DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_NORMAL;\nevent.newDifficulty = DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC;\n\
      bool result = handler.HandleEvent(event);\nif (result) {\n    // Difficulty\
      \ change successfully processed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore event system
    when group difficulty changes occur. Developers should ensure that all relevant
    game state information is properly synchronized after calling this method. The
    method may perform database operations to persist difficulty changes.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid GroupEvent data as it may
    cause undefined behavior or database corruption. Always validate the event parameters
    before passing them to this handler.
