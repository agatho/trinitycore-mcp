  class: LootDistribution
  method: HandleLootConflicts
  signature: void LootDistribution::HandleLootConflicts(uint32 rollId)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves loot roll conflicts for a specified roll ID by handling contested
    loot distributions in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleLootConflicts method is responsible for managing situations
    where multiple players have rolled on the same item, resulting in a conflict that
    requires resolution. This typically occurs when two or more players roll 100 (the
    maximum roll value) on an item, or when other roll-related conflicts arise during
    the loot distribution process. The method processes these conflicts by ensuring
    proper loot assignment according to the game's loot rules and distribution policies.
    It operates within the TrinityCore framework and is part of the core loot management
    system that handles all aspects of item distribution among players in a group
    or raid context.
  parameters:
  - name: rollId
    description: The unique identifier for the specific loot roll that has resulted
      in a conflict. This ID corresponds to a record in the loot distribution system
      and is used to locate and process the conflicting roll information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleLootConflicts
    code: "void example() {\n    uint32 conflictRollId = 12345;\n    LootDistribution::HandleLootConflicts(conflictRollId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling multiple loot conflicts in a loop
    code: "void processAllConflicts() {\n    std::vector<uint32> conflictRollIds =\
      \ {1001, 1002, 1003};\n    for (uint32 rollId : conflictRollIds) {\n       \
      \ LootDistribution::HandleLootConflicts(rollId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the loot distribution system
    when a conflict is detected. Developers should not call this method directly unless
    implementing custom loot handling logic. The method assumes that the roll ID provided
    corresponds to an actual conflict situation and may have undefined behavior if
    passed an invalid or non-conflicting roll ID.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid rollId may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method should only be invoked when a genuine loot conflict exists,
    as determined by the system's internal conflict detection mechanisms.
