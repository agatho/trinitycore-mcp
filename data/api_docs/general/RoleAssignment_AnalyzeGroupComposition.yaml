  class: RoleAssignment
  method: AnalyzeGroupComposition
  signature: GroupComposition RoleAssignment::AnalyzeGroupComposition(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the composition of a group and returns structured data about its
    members.
  description: The AnalyzeGroupComposition method examines the current state of a
    specified group, collecting detailed information about each member including their
    class, level, role distribution, and other relevant attributes. This function
    is typically used for role assignment systems, raid planning, or group optimization
    within the TrinityCore framework. The method processes all online players in the
    group and categorizes them based on predefined criteria such as specialization,
    gear level, and gameplay role (tank, healer, damage dealer). It returns a GroupComposition
    object that encapsulates this analysis for further processing by other systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupComposition object containing detailed breakdown of the group's
    makeup, including member counts by class, role distribution, average level, and
    other statistical data. Returns an empty GroupComposition if the input group is
    null or contains no valid members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to analyze a group
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    GroupComposition\
      \ composition = roleAssignment.AnalyzeGroupComposition(myGroup);\n    // Use\
      \ composition data for role assignment logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using composition data to determine optimal roles
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup)\n{\n    GroupComposition\
      \ comp = roleAssignment.AnalyzeGroupComposition(raidGroup);\n    if (comp.GetTotalMembers()\
      \ >= 5)\n    {\n        // Logic to assign roles based on composition\n    \
      \    // e.g., ensure at least one tank, healer, and DPS\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full scan of the group's members and may have performance
    implications in high-frequency scenarios. It assumes all group members are valid
    players with complete data. The returned GroupComposition object should be treated
    as read-only for analysis purposes.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null group pointer will result in an empty composition
    being returned. Ensure that the group is valid and has active members before calling
    to avoid incorrect role assignments.
