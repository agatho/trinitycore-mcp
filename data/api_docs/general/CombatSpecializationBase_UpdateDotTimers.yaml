  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::UpdateDotTimers(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the timers for all active damage-over-time (DoT) effects on the combat
    specialization.
  description: The UpdateDotTimers method is responsible for managing and updating
    the duration timers of damage-over-time effects that are currently active on a
    player or creature with a specific combat specialization. This method is typically
    called during each game tick to decrement the remaining duration of DoT spells,
    and it handles the logic for applying damage ticks and removing expired effects.
    It ensures that DoT effects behave correctly according to their defined durations
    and tick intervals within the TrinityCore framework. The method takes a time delta
    (diff) parameter which represents the elapsed milliseconds since the last update,
    allowing for precise timing of spell effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void Player::UpdateCombatSpecialization()\n{\n    if (m_combatSpecialization)\n\
      \        m_combatSpecialization->UpdateDotTimers(diff);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat specialization system and should be called
    regularly during combat updates. It's typically invoked from within the main update
    loop or combat tick handler to maintain accurate DoT effect timing. The implementation
    assumes that all active DoTs have been properly initialized with their duration
    and tick information.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter can lead to incorrect DoT durations
    and damage calculations. Ensure that this method is only called when the combat
    specialization is valid and has active DoT effects to prevent potential null pointer
    dereferences or invalid memory access.
