  class: FlightPathMovementGenerator
  method: LoadPath
  signature: void FlightPathMovementGenerator::LoadPath(Player * owner, uint32 startNode)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads a flight path for the specified player starting at
    the given node.
  description: The LoadPath method prepares a flight path movement generator for a
    player by loading the appropriate flight path data from the database. It sets
    up the internal state of the movement generator to begin following the flight
    path starting from the specified start node. This method is typically called when
    a player begins flying along a predefined route, such as an NPC flight master's
    path. The method ensures that all necessary path data is retrieved and validated
    before movement execution begins. It does not immediately start movement but rather
    configures the generator to be ready for subsequent movement commands.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object that will follow this flight path. Must
      be a valid player instance, cannot be null.
  - name: startNode
    description: The index of the starting node in the flight path. This represents
      the point in the path where movement should begin, typically corresponding to
      a waypoint or location in the flight path data structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Path Loading
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get player reference

      uint32 startNode = 0;

      FlightPathMovementGenerator flightGen;

      flightGen.LoadPath(player, startNode);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading Flight Path with Validation
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint32 startNode = player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == MOTION_TYPE_FLIGHT ? 1 : 0;\nif (player && startNode < MAX_FLIGHT_PATH_NODES)\
      \ {\n    FlightPathMovementGenerator flightGen;\n    flightGen.LoadPath(player,\
      \ startNode);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already been assigned a valid flight
    path and that the path data exists in the database. The method performs no validation
    on the node index beyond basic bounds checking. It is expected to be called before
    initiating actual movement using methods like MoveAlongPath or similar. The method
    does not handle concurrent access from multiple threads, so it should be called
    from the main game thread.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null player pointer as it will likely cause
    a crash. Ensure that the startNode parameter is valid and within the bounds of
    the available flight path nodes to prevent undefined behavior. This method does
    not validate the integrity of the flight path data itself, so corrupted or missing
    path data may result in unexpected movement behavior.
