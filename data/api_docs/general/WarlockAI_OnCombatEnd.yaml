documentation:
  brief: Performs cleanup and state reset operations when a warlock's combat session
    ends
  description: The OnCombatEnd method is called when a WarlockAI instance transitions
    out of combat mode. This method handles necessary cleanup tasks such as resetting
    combat-related flags, clearing active spell casts, and ensuring the AI returns
    to its default non-combat state. It serves as a critical part of the AI lifecycle
    management, ensuring proper resource cleanup and state consistency when the warlock
    exits combat. The method is typically invoked by the core game engine when combat
    ends naturally or through external triggers like player logout or zone changes.

  - title: Basic usage in custom AI implementation
    code: "class MyWarlockAI : public WarlockAI {\npublic:\n    void OnCombatEnd()\
      \ override {\n        // Call base class implementation\n        WarlockAI::OnCombatEnd();\n\
      \        \n        // Custom cleanup logic\n        ResetSpecialAbilities();\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard AI lifecycle and should not be called
    manually unless implementing custom AI behavior. The base implementation ensures
    proper state management for all warlock-specific combat mechanics including summon
    cleanup, spell cooldown resets, and pet behavior restoration.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from outside the AI system as it may
    lead to inconsistent AI states or memory leaks. Always ensure proper inheritance
    when overriding this method to maintain core functionality.
