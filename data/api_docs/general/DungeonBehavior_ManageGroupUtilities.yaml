  signature: void DungeonBehavior::ManageGroupUtilities(Group * group, const DungeonEncounter
    & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Manages group utilities and encounter-related behaviors for dungeon encounters.
  description: The ManageGroupUtilities method handles the coordination and management
    of group-related functionalities during dungeon encounters in TrinityCore. It
    ensures that group members are properly synchronized with encounter mechanics,
    such as loot distribution, instance locking, and player status updates. This method
    is typically invoked when a new dungeon encounter begins or when group composition
    changes during an ongoing encounter. The method operates on the provided Group
    object and applies encounter-specific behaviors based on the DungeonEncounter
    data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group participating
      in the dungeon encounter. Must not be null.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object containing data about the
      current dungeon encounter, including encounter state, rewards, and mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Start
    code: "void OnEncounterStart(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n\
      {\n    dungeonBehavior->ManageGroupUtilities(group, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Group Management with Custom Logic
    code: "void HandleDungeonEncounter(Group* group, const DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n\
      {\n    // Pre-processing logic\n    if (encounter.GetEncounterState() == ENCOUNTER_STATE_IN_PROGRESS)\n\
      \    {\n        dungeonBehavior->ManageGroupUtilities(group, encounter);\n \
      \       // Additional custom behavior\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core dungeon encounter management system and should
    be called only when a valid group and encounter are present. It modifies internal
    group states and may trigger additional event notifications to players.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null,
    as passing an invalid pointer can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The DungeonEncounter
    object must also be properly initialized before calling this method.
