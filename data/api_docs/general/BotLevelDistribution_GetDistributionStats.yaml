  method: GetDistributionStats
  signature: DistributionStats BotLevelDistribution::GetDistributionStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical distribution data for bot levels within the game environment.
  description: The GetDistributionStats method returns a DistributionStats object
    containing aggregated statistics about how bot levels are distributed across the
    game world. This method is typically used by game systems or administrators to
    analyze and understand the current level distribution of bots, which can be important
    for balancing gameplay, monitoring system performance, or adjusting difficulty
    settings. The returned data may include counts, averages, minimums, maximums,
    and other statistical measures relevant to bot-level distribution. No parameters
    are required as the method operates on internal state data already configured
    within the BotLevelDistribution class.
  parameters: []
  returns: A DistributionStats object containing statistical information about the
    current distribution of bot levels. This includes metrics such as total count
    of bots, average level, minimum and maximum levels, and potentially variance or
    standard deviation if supported by the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution levelDist;

      DistributionStats stats = levelDist.GetDistributionStats();

      std::cout << "Average bot level: " << stats.averageLevel << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a read-only operation that does not modify internal
    state. It may cache results for performance reasons, so calling it multiple times
    in quick succession might return the same data unless internal distribution changes
    occur.
