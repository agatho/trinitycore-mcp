documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the emergency interrupt mode in the InterruptManager.
  description: The DeactivateEmergencyInterruptMode method disables the emergency
    interrupt state within the InterruptManager class. This function is typically
    used to reset or clear an active emergency interrupt condition, allowing normal
    interrupt handling to resume. The method does not accept any parameters and performs
    no return operations. It is commonly invoked when a temporary interrupt override
    needs to be lifted, such as after a critical event has been handled or when returning
    to standard gameplay behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptManager* interruptMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetInterruptManager();

      interruptMgr->DeactivateEmergencyInterruptMode();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the emergency interrupt mode is known
    to be active. Calling it inappropriately may lead to inconsistent interrupt handling
    states. The method is expected to be thread-safe as part of the core interrupt
    management system.
