  class: Map
  method: GetSceneObject
  signature: int * Map::GetSceneObject(const int & guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the scene object associated with a given GUID from the map.
  description: The GetSceneObject method retrieves a scene object based on its unique
    identifier (GUID) within the Map class. This method is used to access specific
    scene objects that are stored in the map's scene object collection, allowing developers
    to interact with scene objects for various game mechanics purposes such as triggering
    events or managing object states. The method operates on the assumption that the
    GUID corresponds to a valid scene object within the map context.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the scene object to retrieve. This
      parameter must be a valid GUID that exists in the map's scene object collection.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the scene object associated with the given GUID, or
    nullptr if no such object exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: SceneObject* sceneObj = map->GetSceneObject(guid);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to manage scene objects. Performance considerations should be taken into account
    when accessing scene objects frequently, as the method may involve searching through
    the map's scene object collection.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if the GUID does not correspond to any existing
    scene object, so proper validation should be performed before using the returned
    pointer.
