  signature: bool PositionManager::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos, const MovementContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is safe for a unit to move to based on
    movement context.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates if a specified position is considered
    safe for a unit to navigate to, taking into account various movement constraints
    and contextual factors. This method is typically used in pathfinding and movement
    validation logic within the TrinityCore framework. It checks against environmental
    hazards, collision boundaries, and other game-specific safety criteria defined
    by the MovementContext parameter. The result helps prevent units from moving into
    dangerous or invalid locations during AI behavior execution.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: Reference to an integer representing the position identifier or index
      within the movement system. This value typically corresponds to a specific location
      in the navigation mesh or grid system.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a MovementContext object that contains contextual information
      about the movement request, including unit type, movement flags, environmental
      conditions, and other relevant parameters affecting safety evaluation.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position is deemed safe for movement according
    to the provided context; otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates
    potential hazards or invalidity at that position.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement validation
    code: "if (positionManager.IsPositionSafe(targetPosition, movementContext)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with movement to targetPosition\n    unit->MoveTo(targetPosition);\n\
      } else {\n    // Find alternative path or abort movement\n    unit->SetTarget(nullptr);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI decision making
    code: "bool safeToAdvance = positionManager.IsPositionSafe(nextWaypoint, unit->GetMovementContext());\n\
      if (safeToAdvance && unit->CanMove()) {\n    unit->MoveTo(nextWaypoint);\n \
      \   return true;\n} else {\n    // Trigger fallback behavior\n    unit->ExecuteFallbackStrategy();\n\
      \    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against collision data, terrain height
    differences, and unit-specific movement capabilities. The MovementContext parameter
    is crucial as it defines the safety criteria based on unit type (e.g., flying
    vs ground units) and current game state. Performance-wise, this check should be
    lightweight but may involve spatial queries or cached data lookups.
  warnings: Ensure that the position identifier passed in 'pos' corresponds to a valid
    location within the movement system's coordinate space. Invalid positions could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect safety assessments. The method assumes
    proper initialization of MovementContext with relevant unit state information.
