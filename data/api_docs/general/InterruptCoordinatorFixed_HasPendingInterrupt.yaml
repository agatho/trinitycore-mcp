  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: HasPendingInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptCoordinatorFixed::HasPendingInterrupt(int botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a bot has a pending interrupt scheduled for execution
  description: Determines whether the specified bot (identified by its GUID) has an
    interrupt operation that is currently pending in the interrupt coordinator. This
    method is used to query the state of interrupt handling for a specific bot, typically
    within the context of AI behavior or combat logic. The check does not modify any
    internal state and is generally used to prevent duplicate interrupt operations
    or to synchronize interrupt-related actions with other game systems.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to check for pending interrupts.
      This should be a valid GUID representing a player or NPC bot within the TrinityCore
      instance.
  returns: True if the specified bot has a pending interrupt operation scheduled;
    false otherwise. Returns false if the bot is not found or if no interrupt is currently
    pending.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Pending Interrupt
    code: "if (interruptCoordinator.HasPendingInterrupt(botGuid)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ case where interrupt is already pending\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"AI\", \"Interrupt\
      \ already pending for bot {}\", botGuid);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with scheduling\
      \ a new interrupt\n    interruptCoordinator.ScheduleInterrupt(botGuid, interruptType);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in AI decision-making loops to avoid redundant
    interrupt scheduling. It's important to note that the method only checks for pending
    interrupts and does not perform any interrupt execution itself.
