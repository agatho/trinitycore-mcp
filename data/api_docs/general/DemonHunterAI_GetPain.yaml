documentation:
  brief: Returns the current pain resource value of the demon hunter AI.
  description: The GetPain method retrieves the current amount of Pain resource that
    the demon hunter AI has accumulated. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation,
    Pain is a resource specific to Demon Hunters that fuels their abilities and gameplay
    mechanics. This method provides read-only access to the internal Pain counter
    managed by the DemonHunterAI class, allowing other systems or scripts to query
    the current resource level without modifying it. The returned value typically
    represents the amount of Pain available for spending on abilities such as Eye
    Beam, Fel Rush, or other demon hunter-specific spells that consume Pain.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the current Pain resource value. This value is
    typically non-negative and increases as the demon hunter performs actions that
    generate Pain, such as melee attacks or using certain abilities. The exact maximum
    value depends on game mechanics but is usually capped at a predefined limit.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pain Level Before Casting Ability
    code: "if (DemonHunterAI* ai = dynamic_cast<DemonHunterAI*>(unit->GetAI()))\n\
      {\n    int pain = ai->GetPain();\n    if (pain >= 40)\n    {\n        // Cast\
      \ Eye Beam\n        unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_EYE_BEAM, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitor Pain Resource for Strategy
    code: "void DemonHunterStrategy::Update()\n{\n    if (DemonHunterAI* ai = dynamic_cast<DemonHunterAI*>(me->GetAI()))\n\
      \    {\n        int pain = ai->GetPain();\n        if (pain > 80)\n        {\n\
      \            // Consider using a high-cost ability\n            DoHighCostAbility();\n\
      \        }\n        else if (pain < 20)\n        {\n            // Focus on\
      \ generating Pain\n            GeneratePain();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a const function, meaning it does not modify the internal
    state of the DemonHunterAI object. It should be safe to call from any context
    where read-only access to the Pain resource is needed. The Pain value may fluctuate
    based on combat actions and abilities used by the demon hunter.
  warnings: Ensure that the unit actually has a DemonHunterAI instance before calling
    this method, otherwise the behavior is undefined. This method should not be used
    to directly modify Pain values; use appropriate setter methods or ability execution
    functions instead.
