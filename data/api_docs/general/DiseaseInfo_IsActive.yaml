  signature: bool DiseaseInfo::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a disease effect is currently active on the target.
  description: The IsActive method checks if a disease debuff is currently applied
    and active on the target unit. This method is typically used in combat systems
    to verify the status of disease effects such as 'Poison' or 'Disease' spells that
    have been cast by players or NPCs. The check considers both the existence of the
    disease aura and its active state within the game's tick system. This functionality
    is essential for calculating damage over time (DoT) effects, determining spell
    effectiveness, and managing combat mechanics related to disease-based afflictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a disease effect is currently active on the target, false
    otherwise. The method will return false if no disease aura exists or if the aura
    has expired.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Disease is Active Before Applying New One
    code: "if (!target->GetDiseaseInfo()->IsActive()) {\n    // Apply new disease\
      \ effect\n    target->ApplyDiseaseSpell(spellId);\n} else {\n    // Handle case\
      \ where disease is already active\n    target->RefreshDiseaseDuration();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsActive in Combat Damage Calculation
    code: "void CalculateDiseaseDamage(Unit* attacker, Unit* target) {\n    if (target->GetDiseaseInfo()->IsActive())\
      \ {\n        uint32 damage = target->GetDiseaseInfo()->GetTickDamage();\n  \
      \      attacker->DealDamage(target, damage, NULL, DOT, SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_NORMAL);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal disease tracking system within TrinityCore's
    aura management. The active state may be affected by immunity checks, dispel effects,
    or other game mechanics that can remove or disable disease auras. Developers should
    note that this check is typically performed during combat update cycles and may
    not reflect real-time changes immediately.
  warnings: Be aware that IsActive() only reflects the current active state of the
    disease effect - it does not account for pending or queued effects. Also, calling
    this method on units without disease tracking capabilities may result in undefined
    behavior or return false even when a disease is present.
