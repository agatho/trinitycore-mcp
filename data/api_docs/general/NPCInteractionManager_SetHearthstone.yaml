  signature: bool NPCInteractionManager::SetHearthstone(Creature * innkeeper)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's hearthstone location to the specified innkeeper's location.
  description: The SetHearthstone method configures the player's hearthstone to teleport
    to the location of the provided innkeeper creature. This method is typically invoked
    during NPC interaction when a player selects to set their hearthstone at an inn.
    It validates that the provided creature is indeed an innkeeper and performs the
    necessary game state updates to register the new hearthstone location. The method
    returns true upon successful setting, or false if the operation fails due to invalid
    parameters or game state constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hearthstone was successfully set to the innkeeper's
    location; otherwise, returns false if the operation failed due to invalid input
    or game state restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Setting Hearthstone at an Innkeeper
    code: "if (NPCInteractionManager::SetHearthstone(innkeeperCreature))\n{\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Hearthstone set to the inn.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Failed to set hearthstone.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrinityCore's internal hearthstone system and requires
    that the provided Creature object is properly initialized as an innkeeper with
    valid location data. The method does not perform any direct visual feedback to
    the player; it only updates the game state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Creature pointer passed to this method is valid and points
    to an actual innkeeper NPC, otherwise the behavior may be undefined or cause errors.
    This method should not be called outside of appropriate interaction contexts such
    as quest or gossip handlers.
