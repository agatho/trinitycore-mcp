  signature: bool AdaptiveBehaviorManager::PreferMelee() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the AI should prefer melee combat over ranged attacks.
  description: The PreferMelee method evaluates the current combat situation and returns
    true if the AI should prioritize melee attacks, or false if ranged attacks are
    more appropriate. This decision is typically based on factors such as distance
    to target, available abilities, and the AI's configured behavior preferences.
    The method is commonly used in adaptive AI systems where combat strategy dynamically
    adjusts based on situational awareness.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the AI should prefer melee attacks in the current situation;
    otherwise returns false if ranged attacks are preferred or more suitable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine combat preference
    code: "if (adaptiveBehaviorManager.PreferMelee()) {\n    // Switch to melee attack\
      \ logic\n    unit->SetMeleeAttack(true);\n} else {\n    // Use ranged attack\
      \ logic\n    unit->SetRangedAttack(true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the adaptive AI behavior system and may be called
    frequently during combat updates. The decision-making process considers multiple
    factors including target distance, weapon type, and current threat level.
