  signature: bool Battlefield::IsWarTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battlefield is currently in a war state.
  description: The IsWarTime method checks if the battlefield is currently active
    in a war state, which typically indicates that players can engage in combat and
    the battlefield's objectives are active. This method is commonly used to control
    game logic such as enabling or disabling player actions, displaying relevant UI
    elements, or managing quest states during active battlefields. The result of this
    method directly affects gameplay mechanics related to PvP activities and battlefield
    participation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the battlefield is currently in a war state (i.e., actively
    engaged in combat), false otherwise. This indicates whether players can participate
    in the battlefield's objectives and combat mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check War State
    code: "if (battlefield->IsWarTime())\n{\n    // Allow player to engage in combat\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Battlefield is now active!\");\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Disable combat actions\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Battlefield\
      \ is not currently active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsWarTime in Event Handling
    code: "void Battlefield::OnPlayerEnter(Player* player)\n{\n    if (IsWarTime())\n\
      \    {\n        // Grant war participation buffs\n        player->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_BATTLEFIELD_BUFF, true);\n        player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      War is in progress. You are now engaged.\");\n    }\n    else\n    {\n     \
      \   player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Battlefield is not currently active.\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal battlefield state flags rather than performing
    expensive computations. It's recommended to cache the result if checking this
    condition frequently in performance-critical code paths.
