  class: GroupIntegration
  method: DisableCoordinationForGroup
  signature: void GroupIntegration::DisableCoordinationForGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Disables coordination features for a specified group in the World of Warcraft
    server.
  description: The DisableCoordinationForGroup method removes or deactivates any active
    coordination mechanisms associated with the provided Group object. This typically
    affects how the group interacts with shared objectives, loot distribution, or
    synchronized actions across multiple players. The method is used primarily during
    certain quest sequences, instance encounters, or when temporary group behavior
    changes are required. It ensures that the group's members operate independently
    without relying on centralized coordination logic.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to the Group object for which coordination should be disabled.
      Must not be null; otherwise, the method may cause undefined behavior or crash.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Disabling Coordination for a Player's Current Group
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    GroupIntegration::DisableCoordinationForGroup(playerGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags or state variables within the
    Group class to disable specific coordination systems. It is recommended to call
    this only when necessary, as excessive use may interfere with normal group functionality.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the group parameter will result in undefined
    behavior and could lead to crashes or memory corruption. Always verify that the
    group exists before calling this method.
