documentation:
  brief: Records a reward value within the scoped learning session for performance
    tracking and analytics.
  description: The RecordReward method logs a floating-point reward value associated
    with the current learning session. This functionality is typically used in reinforcement
    learning or behavior modeling scenarios within the game engine to track agent
    performance, training progress, or decision-making outcomes. The method does not
    return any value but stores the reward internally for potential later retrieval
    or analysis. It is expected that this method be called during active learning
    sessions where rewards are being evaluated and recorded for statistical purposes.

    code: 'ScopedLearningSession session;

      float reward = 0.75f;

      session.RecordReward(reward);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with internal game analytics systems to monitor
    learning behavior over time. It may be used in conjunction with other session
    management methods such as Start(), End(), or GetRewards(). Ensure that the reward
    values passed are meaningful for your specific learning algorithm.
