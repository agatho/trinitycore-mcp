  brief: Sends spell start packet to the player's client
  description: The SendSpellStart method is responsible for transmitting the spell
    start packet to the player's client, indicating that a spell has begun casting.
    This method is typically called during spell execution to notify the client of
    the spell's initiation and to display relevant visual effects or animations. It
    plays a crucial role in maintaining synchronization between server-side spell
    logic and client-side visual feedback.

    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo);

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the spell has been initialized but before
    it begins executing. It typically involves sending a packet to the client that
    includes spell information such as spell ID, target GUID, and casting time.
