  brief: Removes the player from their current garrison, clearing all garrison-related
    data and restoring normal gameplay state.
  description: The Garrison::Leave method is responsible for removing a player from
    their active garrison instance. This method typically handles cleanup of garrison-specific
    data, such as mission assignments, building states, and any temporary game state
    modifications related to the garrison. It ensures that when a player leaves their
    garrison, they are properly returned to their normal gameplay environment without
    any lingering garrison-related effects or data corruption. The method is usually
    invoked when a player exits the garrison area or when the garrison session ends,
    ensuring proper synchronization between the player's character state and the game
    world.

    code: "Garrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif (garrison)\n{\n    garrison->Leave();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal cleanup routines that reset garrison-related
    flags and restore the player's original state. It may also send network updates
    to other players in the area to reflect the player's departure from the garrison.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player is actually within a garrison
    context could lead to undefined behavior or data inconsistency. Always verify
    that a valid garrison exists before calling Leave().
