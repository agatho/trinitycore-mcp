documentation:
  brief: Sets a player's skill level for a specific skill.
  description: The SetSkill method allows developers to modify a player's skill level
    in a specific skill. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft development
    to adjust player skill progression, set skill levels to maximum values, or reset
    skills to certain states. It directly affects the player's skill database and
    can be used for various game mechanics including quest rewards, crafting abilities,
    or skill-based gameplay adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The skill ID (e.g., 164 for Blacksmithing, 165 for Leatherworking)
      to modify. This parameter identifies which skill is being adjusted.
  - name: step
    description: The current skill step or level. This represents the current skill
      level of the player's skill.
  - name: newVal
    description: The new skill value to set. This parameter defines the desired skill
      level that the player will have after the operation.
  - name: maxVal
    description: The maximum skill value allowed for this skill. This represents the
      maximum skill level that can be achieved for the skill.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a skill to maximum value
    code: player->SetSkill(164, 0, 450, 450);
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting skill level to specific value
    code: player->SetSkill(165, 0, 300, 300);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates the player's skill database directly and is typically
    used in conjunction with other skill-related methods. It does not send updates
    to the client; changes must be manually broadcasted if needed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it can cause skill level mismatches
    if not handled properly. Also, setting a skill to a value higher than allowed
    may result in invalid skill states or errors.
