  class: TotemAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int TotemAI::Permissible(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the TotemAI class can be used for a given creature.
  description: The Permissible method is used to evaluate if a specific creature instance
    is eligible to use the TotemAI behavior. This method is part of the TrinityCore's
    AI system and is typically called during AI assignment to determine compatibility.
    It returns an integer value indicating the level of permissiveness, where higher
    values indicate stronger suitability for using this AI type. The method helps
    in avoiding incorrect AI assignments and ensures that only appropriate creatures
    (such as totems) are given the TotemAI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating how permissible it is to use TotemAI
    for the creature. A positive value suggests strong compatibility, zero means not
    permissible, and negative values may indicate weak or conditional compatibility
    depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI assignment
    code: "int permissible = totemAI->Permissible(creature);\nif (permissible > 0)\
      \ {\n    // Assign TotemAI to creature\n    creature->SetAI(totemAI);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    like Initialize(), UpdateAI(), and JustDied() within the TotemAI class. The exact
    return value interpretation may vary based on how the base AI system evaluates
    permissible values, but typically follows standard TrinityCore AI conventions.
