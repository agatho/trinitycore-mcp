  class: BotAI
  method: HandleTriggeredAction
  signature: void BotAI::HandleTriggeredAction(const TriggerResult & result)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a triggered action based on the provided trigger result in the
    bot's AI system.
  description: The HandleTriggeredAction method is responsible for executing the appropriate
    actions within the BotAI system when a specific trigger condition has been met.
    It takes a TriggerResult object as input, which contains information about the
    trigger event and its associated data. This method serves as the core handler
    for bot decision-making logic, determining how the AI should respond to various
    in-game events or conditions. The method typically integrates with the broader
    AI state machine to ensure proper execution flow and maintains consistency with
    the bot's overall behavior patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: A const reference to a TriggerResult object containing trigger event
      data and associated parameters that determine how the action should be processed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleTriggeredAction
    code: "void MyBotAI::OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    TriggerResult\
      \ result;\n    result.type = TRIGGER_COMBAT_ENTER;\n    result.data = player->GetGUID();\n\
      \    HandleTriggeredAction(result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system's event handling
    mechanism. Developers should ensure that the TriggerResult object passed to this
    method contains valid data before calling it, as invalid trigger data may lead
    to unexpected behavior or crashes.
