documentation:
  brief: Handles the dead zone logic for a marksmanship hunter's targeting system
  description: The HandleDeadZone method processes the dead zone behavior for a marksmanship
    hunter, which typically involves managing the area around the target where the
    hunter cannot effectively shoot. This method likely adjusts the hunter's aim or
    targeting mechanics to avoid firing within this restricted zone. The implementation
    may involve calculating distances, checking target positions, and modifying shooting
    parameters based on proximity to the dead zone boundaries. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay balance and realistic hunting mechanics
    in the context of marksmanship abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that likely represents a configuration
      value or state flag related to dead zone handling
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dead Zone Handling
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored hunter;

      int deadZoneConfig = 5;

      hunter.HandleDeadZone(&deadZoneConfig);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the hunter's current target and positioning
    to determine appropriate dead zone behavior. The integer parameter may represent
    a configuration value such as dead zone radius, threshold distance, or state flags.
  warnings: The method modifies internal hunter state based on the input parameter,
    so incorrect values could lead to unexpected targeting behavior or gameplay imbalance.
