  class: FollowAction
  method: GetFollowDistance
  signature: float FollowAction::GetFollowDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current follow distance threshold used by the FollowAction
    AI behavior.
  description: The GetFollowDistance method returns the float value representing the
    maximum allowed distance a creature or unit can be from its target before the
    FollowAction triggers repositioning. This distance is typically used in AI pathfinding
    and movement logic to maintain a desired proximity to the target. The returned
    value is usually measured in yards and may vary based on the specific implementation
    of the FollowAction class, potentially influenced by creature type, difficulty
    settings, or other game mechanics. This method is commonly called during AI update
    cycles to determine whether a unit should move closer to or farther from its target.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the follow distance threshold in yards. This
    value defines how close the AI unit should attempt to stay to its target during
    follow behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float distance = followAction->GetFollowDistance();\nif (distance > 5.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Perform actions based on distance\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Follow Distance in AI Logic
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n    \
      \    return;\n\n    float followDistance = me->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator()->GetFollowDistance();\n\
      \    if (me->GetDistance(me->GetVictim()) > followDistance)\n    {\n       \
      \ // Move closer to victim\n        me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(me->GetVictim());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement generators and
    AI state machines. The returned value may be modified by various factors including
    creature AI settings, player actions, or game difficulty levels.
  warnings: Ensure that the FollowAction instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized object could lead to undefined behavior.
    This method should not be called during critical AI update phases without proper
    locking mechanisms if thread safety is a concern.
