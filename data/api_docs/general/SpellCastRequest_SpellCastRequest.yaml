  class: SpellCastRequest
  method: SpellCastRequest
  signature: void SpellCastRequest::SpellCastRequest(int && castRequest, int castingUnitGUID,
    int itemData)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a spell cast request with specified parameters for processing
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The SpellCastRequest constructor initializes a new spell cast request
    object using the provided casting request identifier, unit GUID, and item data.
    This method is typically used in the context of handling spell casting logic within
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation. It sets up internal state
    required to process the spell cast operation, including validating input parameters
    and preparing necessary data structures for execution. The method does not perform
    actual spell casting but rather prepares the request for subsequent processing
    by the core spell system.
  parameters:
  - name: castRequest
    description: An integer identifier representing the specific spell casting request
      to be processed. This value typically corresponds to a spell ID or request type
      within the TrinityCore spell system.
  - name: castingUnitGUID
    description: A unique identifier (GUID) of the unit (player, NPC, etc.) that is
      initiating the spell cast request. This GUID is used to track and validate the
      casting unit throughout the spell execution process.
  - name: itemData
    description: An integer value containing item-related data associated with the
      spell cast request. This may include item ID, charges, or other metadata required
      for proper spell execution when the cast originates from an item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Cast Request Initialization
    code: SpellCastRequest request(12345, 67890, 54321);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing with Dynamic Values
    code: 'int spellId = 12345;

      uint64 casterGuid = player->GetGUID();

      int itemGuid = 54321;

      SpellCastRequest request(std::move(spellId), casterGuid, itemGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal spell handling system in TrinityCore
    and should only be called when a valid spell casting context exists. The parameters
    are expected to be validated before this constructor is invoked. The method uses
    move semantics for the castRequest parameter, indicating it's designed to efficiently
    transfer ownership of the value.
  warnings: Improper initialization of SpellCastRequest parameters can lead to undefined
    behavior or failed spell casts. Ensure that castingUnitGUID refers to a valid
    unit in the current world context before calling this constructor. The itemData
    parameter should be carefully validated as it may affect spell execution logic.
