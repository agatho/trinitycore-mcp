documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the paladin is within melee attack range of a target.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if the PaladinAI instance's current
    target is within the melee combat range of the paladin. This method is crucial
    for determining when to engage in melee attacks or switch to ranged abilities.
    It typically considers the paladin's weapon range, target distance, and any applicable
    combat mechanics such as attack range modifiers or spell effects that might alter
    the effective melee range. The method returns true if the target is within acceptable
    melee distance, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the paladin's current target is within melee range; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat decision making
    code: "if (paladinAI->IsInMeleeRange()) {\n    // Perform melee attack\n    paladinAI->Attack();\n\
      } else {\n    // Switch to ranged or spell-based attack\n    paladinAI->CastSpell(SpellId::Judgement);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal AI state tracking for the current target
    and may be affected by movement, positioning, and combat stance changes. It's
    typically used in conjunction with other AI decision-making methods to determine
    optimal combat behavior.
