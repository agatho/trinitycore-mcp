  signature: void Item::LoadArtifactData(const Player * owner, uint64 xp, uint32 artifactAppearanceId,
    uint32 artifactTier, int & powers)
documentation:
  brief: Loads artifact data for an item based on player ownership and artifact appearance
    ID.
  description: This method initializes artifact data for an item, setting up the artifact
    properties including appearance ID, tier, and power levels based on the player's
    ownership and experience. It is used to configure artifact items within the World
    of Warcraft client, particularly for the Artifact system which allows players
    to upgrade their weapons with different artifact traits and powers. The method
    ensures that artifact items are properly initialized with correct data according
    to the player's current artifact progress and experience.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who owns the item. This determines the
      artifact progression and experience used for initialization.
  - name: xp
    description: The experience points (uint64) that the player has accumulated for
      artifact progression. This value affects how many powers are assigned to the
      artifact.
  - name: artifactAppearanceId
    description: The unique identifier for the artifact appearance, which determines
      the visual representation of the artifact item. This is used to set the correct
      artifact appearance in the game world.
  - name: artifactTier
    description: The tier level of the artifact, which determines how many powers
      are assigned to the artifact based on player's experience and progression.
  - name: powers
    description: Reference to an integer that will be updated with the number of powers
      assigned to the artifact. This parameter is modified in place to reflect the
      artifact's power level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Artifact Data Loading
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      Player* player = new Player();

      uint64 xp = 10000;

      uint32 artifactAppearanceId = 12345;

      uint32 artifactTier = 3;

      int powers = 0;

      item->LoadArtifactData(player, xp, artifactAppearanceId, artifactTier, powers);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Artifact Data Loading with Player Experience
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      Player* player = new Player();

      uint64 xp = player->GetXP();

      uint32 artifactAppearanceId = 54321;

      uint32 artifactTier = 5;

      int powers = 0;

      item->LoadArtifactData(player, xp, artifactAppearanceId, artifactTier, powers);

      // powers now contains the number of artifact powers assigned based on player''s
      experience'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during item creation or initialization when
    artifact data needs to be set for an item. It requires that the player object
    be valid and that the artifact appearance ID be correctly defined. The method
    may involve multiple internal checks and updates to ensure proper artifact progression.
  warnings: The method may fail if the player object is not properly initialized or
    if the artifact appearance ID is invalid. Care must be taken when assigning powers
    to ensure that the correct number of artifact powers are assigned based on experience
    and tier level.
