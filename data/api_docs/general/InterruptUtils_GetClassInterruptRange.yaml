  class: InterruptUtils
  method: GetClassInterruptRange
  signature: float InterruptUtils::GetClassInterruptRange(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the interrupt range value for a specified player class.
  description: The GetClassInterruptRange method retrieves the default interrupt range
    associated with a given player class. This value is used in combat mechanics to
    determine how far away an enemy must be for a spell or ability to be interrupted
    by incoming damage. The method maps player class identifiers to predefined float
    values representing these ranges, which are typically used in spell interruption
    calculations and game balance mechanics within TrinityCore's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the interrupt range for the specified player
    class. This value indicates the maximum distance (in yards) at which an interrupt
    can occur. Returns 0.0 if the provided class ID is invalid or not supported.
  examples:
  - title: Get interrupt range for Warrior class
    code: 'float range = InterruptUtils::GetClassInterruptRange(CLASS_WARRIOR);

      // Returns the interrupt range for warriors, typically around 8.0 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate and use interrupt range in combat logic
    code: "uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();\nfloat interruptRange = InterruptUtils::GetClassInterruptRange(playerClass);\n\
      if (interruptRange > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Use interruptRange for spell interruption\
      \ checks\n    // Example: check if target is within range\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal class mappings defined in TrinityCore's
    core configuration or hardcoded values. The returned values are typically based
    on game balance requirements and may vary between different World of Warcraft
    expansions or custom server configurations.
  warnings: Ensure that the player class parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid class IDs may return 0.0 which could lead to incorrect interrupt behavior
    in combat calculations.
