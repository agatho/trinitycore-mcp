  method: UpdateBotSpecialization
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::UpdateBotSpecialization(uint32_t botGuid,
    uint8_t newSpecialization)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the specialization of a bot identified by its GUID in the performance
    analytics system.
  description: The UpdateBotSpecialization method is responsible for updating the
    specialization assignment of a specific bot within the TrinityCore bot performance
    analytics framework. This method takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID) and a
    new specialization value, then records or modifies the specialization data associated
    with that bot. The specialization typically represents the class role or talent
    build assigned to the bot, which can be used for performance tracking, statistical
    analysis, or in-game behavior adjustments. This method is part of the broader
    analytics system designed to monitor and evaluate bot performance across different
    gameplay specializations.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose specialization is being
      updated. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the TrinityCore
      instance.
  - name: newSpecialization
    description: The new specialization value to assign to the bot. This typically
      represents a class role or talent tree identifier, with valid values usually
      ranging from 0 to the maximum number of specializations supported by the game
      class.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a Warrior Bot's Specialization
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.UpdateBotSpecialization(12345, 1); // Sets bot with GUID 12345 to
      Arms specialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Multiple Bots' Specializations
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001,\
      \ 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid : botGuids) {\n    analytics.UpdateBotSpecialization(guid,\
      \ 2); // Set all bots to Fury specialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures that store bot
    performance metrics. It may trigger updates to related analytics tables or caches.
    Ensure the provided GUID corresponds to an existing bot entity to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Passing an invalid botGuid could lead to data corruption or access violations.
    The newSpecialization value should be validated against supported specialization
    values for the bot's class to prevent invalid state transitions.
