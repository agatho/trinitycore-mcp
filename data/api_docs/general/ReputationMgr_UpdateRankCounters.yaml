documentation:
  brief: Updates internal counters based on reputation rank changes for a player
  description: The UpdateRankCounters method is responsible for maintaining accurate
    internal tracking of reputation ranks within the ReputationMgr class. When a player's
    reputation with a faction changes from one rank to another, this method updates
    the necessary counters and flags to reflect the new state. It ensures that the
    game's reputation system correctly tracks how many times a player has achieved
    specific rank milestones and handles any associated logic such as reward tracking
    or achievement progression. The method operates on the internal state of the ReputationMgr
    instance and does not directly interact with external systems beyond updating
    its own counters.
  parameters:
  - name: old_rank
    description: The previous reputation rank value before the change, typically ranging
      from 0 (Hated) to 7 (Exalted)
  - name: new_rank
    description: The new reputation rank value after the change, typically ranging
      from 0 (Hated) to 7 (Exalted)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Updating Reputation Rank Counters
    code: 'ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();

      int oldRank = repMgr->GetFactionRank(factionId);

      // ... reputation change logic ...

      int newRank = repMgr->GetFactionRank(factionId);

      repMgr->UpdateRankCounters(oldRank, newRank);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the reputation system when
    faction standings are modified. Developers should be aware that it modifies internal
    counters and may trigger additional logic related to rank-based rewards or achievements.
    The method assumes valid rank values between 0 and 7, though no explicit validation
    is performed.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid rank values (outside the 0-7 range) could
    lead to unexpected behavior in the reputation tracking system. Ensure that old_rank
    and new_rank parameters are properly validated before calling this method.
