documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the current energy percentage of an energy combo resource.
  description: The GetEnergyPercent method computes the percentage of energy currently
    available in an energy combo resource, relative to its maximum capacity. This
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft-style games to display resource bars or
    determine skill availability for abilities that consume energy. The method performs
    a simple arithmetic calculation to convert the current energy value into a percentage
    and returns the result as an integer between 0 and 100. It does not modify any
    internal state and is safe to call multiple times without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current energy level as a percentage (0-100).
    Returns 0 if no energy is available, or 100 if the resource is at maximum capacity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 energyPercent = player->GetEnergyComboResource()->GetEnergyPercent();\n\
      if (energyPercent >= 50)\n{\n    // Player has at least half of their energy\
      \ available\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_ENERGY_BASED_ABILITY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Bar Update
    code: "void UpdateEnergyBar(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 percent = player->GetEnergyComboResource()->GetEnergyPercent();\n\
      \    // Update UI element to show percent\n    uiElement->SetProgress(percent);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the energy combo resource has valid internal values
    for current and maximum energy. It is recommended to verify that the resource
    object is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the EnergyComboResource instance is not null before invoking
    this method. Calling GetEnergyPercent on a destroyed or uninitialized resource
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes in debug builds.
