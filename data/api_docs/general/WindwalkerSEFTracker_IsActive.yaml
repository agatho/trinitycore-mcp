  class: WindwalkerSEFTracker
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool WindwalkerSEFTracker::IsActive() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the WindwalkerSEFTracker is currently active and tracking a valid
    state.
  description: The IsActive method determines whether the WindwalkerSEFTracker instance
    is in an active state, meaning it is currently tracking or managing a valid Windwalker
    Spirit Essence Form (SEF) state. This method typically checks internal flags or
    conditions that indicate if the tracker has been initialized and is actively monitoring
    the player's SEF status. The result of this check is crucial for determining whether
    further operations related to SEF tracking should be performed, such as applying
    effects, updating cooldowns, or triggering events. It ensures that only valid
    and active tracking sessions are considered in game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the WindwalkerSEFTracker is currently active and tracking
    a valid SEF state; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check tracker status
    code: "if (windwalkerTracker.IsActive()) {\n    // Perform actions related to\
      \ active SEF tracking\n    DoSEFTracking();\n} else {\n    // Handle inactive\
      \ state\n    ResetSEFState();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a lightweight check that accesses internal flags or
    state variables. It should be used frequently in game loops or event handlers
    to ensure proper tracking behavior without performance overhead.
