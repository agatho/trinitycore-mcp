  class: PlayerProfile
  method: GetArchetype
  signature: PlayerArchetype PlayerProfile::GetArchetype() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the archetype associated with the player profile.
  description: The GetArchetype method returns the PlayerArchetype enum value that
    represents the character's class specialization or role within the game. This
    archetype is typically determined during character creation and can influence
    various gameplay mechanics such as available abilities, starting stats, and certain
    quest interactions. The returned value corresponds to predefined archetypes in
    the TrinityCore framework and is used internally by the server to manage class-specific
    behaviors and configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A PlayerArchetype enum value representing the character's archetype. Possible
    values include various class specializations or roles such as Warrior, Mage, Rogue,
    etc., depending on the game's implementation and expansion content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "PlayerArchetype archetype = playerProfile->GetArchetype();\nif (archetype\
      \ == PlayerArchetype::WARRIOR)\n{\n    // Handle warrior-specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Archetype
    code: "PlayerArchetype archetype = playerProfile->GetArchetype();\nswitch (archetype)\n\
      {\n    case PlayerArchetype::MAGE:\n        // Apply mage-specific modifications\n\
      \        break;\n    case PlayerArchetype::ROGUE:\n        // Apply rogue-specific\
      \ modifications\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other archetypes\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in game logic to determine character capabilities
    and behavior. It's important to note that archetype values may vary based on the
    specific TrinityCore build and expansion support. The method is thread-safe as
    it only reads immutable data from the player profile.
  warnings: Ensure that any code relying on this method handles all possible enum
    values, including potential future additions to the PlayerArchetype enum. Avoid
    making assumptions about archetype behavior beyond what's explicitly defined in
    the game mechanics.
