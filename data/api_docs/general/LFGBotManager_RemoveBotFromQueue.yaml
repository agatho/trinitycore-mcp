  class: LFGBotManager
  method: RemoveBotFromQueue
  signature: void LFGBotManager::RemoveBotFromQueue(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified bot player from the LFG queue.
  description: The RemoveBotFromQueue method removes a given bot player from the Looking
    for Group (LFG) queue system. This function is typically used by the LFGBotManager
    to manage bot participation in group finding activities. The method ensures that
    the specified bot is no longer considered for group matching and will not be assigned
    to any LFG instances or dungeons. It performs necessary cleanup operations to
    maintain queue integrity and prevents further processing of this bot's LFG requests.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot to be removed from
      the LFG queue. Must not be null and must represent a valid bot player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      LFGBotManager::instance()->RemoveBotFromQueue(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Checking
    code: "if (myBot != nullptr)\n{\n    LFGBotManager::instance()->RemoveBotFromQueue(myBot);\n\
      \    // Bot is now removed from LFG queue\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player pointer is valid and represents
    an actual bot. The implementation likely involves removing the bot from internal
    data structures tracking queued players, updating queue state, and potentially
    notifying other systems about the removal.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method may result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid Player object before
    calling this function.
