  class: Creature
  method: GetDebugInfo
  signature: std::string Creature::GetDebugInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns debug information about the creature including its GUID, entry ID,
    and spawn parameters.
  description: The GetDebugInfo method retrieves comprehensive debug information about
    a Creature object, including its unique identifier (GUID), entry ID, and various
    spawn-related parameters. This method is primarily used for debugging purposes
    within the TrinityCore framework to help developers understand the creature's
    current state and behavior. The returned string contains formatted data that can
    be used to identify and track specific creatures in the game world, making it
    valuable for both development and troubleshooting activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a formatted string containing debug information about the creature
    including GUID, entry ID, and spawn parameters. The string format typically includes
    the creature's unique identifier and related spawn data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debug Information Retrieval
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      std::string debugInfo = creature->GetDebugInfo();

      // Output: "GUID: 12345, Entry: 1234, Spawn: 0"

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging purposes and may include
    additional information depending on the creature's current state. The returned
    string format can vary based on implementation details and may contain multiple
    data points in a structured manner.
  warnings: The debug information returned by this method should not be used for production
    code or game logic, as it's primarily designed for development and debugging purposes.
    Using this method in performance-critical code sections could impact server performance.
