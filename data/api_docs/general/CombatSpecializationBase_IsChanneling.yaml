documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is currently channeling a spell.
  description: The IsChanneling method checks if the combat specialization base object
    (typically a player or creature) is currently engaged in channeling a spell. This
    state typically occurs when a spell effect is being continuously applied over
    time, such as with healing over time effects, damage over time spells, or certain
    aura applications. The method returns true if the unit is actively channeling
    and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for game mechanics that depend
    on tracking active spell states, such as preventing certain actions during channeling,
    managing resource costs, or determining valid combat interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently channeling a spell; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsChanneling()) {\n    // Player\
      \ is channeling, prevent movement or casting\n    player->SendSpellFailed(0,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NOPATH);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Logic
    code: "void PlayerCombatAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->GetCombatSpecialization()->IsChanneling())\
      \ {\n        // Adjust behavior during channeling\n        DoCast(SPELL_CHANNELING_AURA);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal spell state tracking within the TrinityCore
    framework. It may not reflect channeling states immediately after a spell is cast
    but rather when the spell's channeling effect is active. The implementation typically
    checks for active aura effects or spell cast states that indicate ongoing channeling.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only reflects the current channeling state and
    does not account for potential interruptions or cancellations that may occur in
    the same game tick. Always consider using additional checks if precise timing
    of channeling events is required.
