  signature: NPCFlags2 Unit::GetNpcFlags2() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the NPC flags2 value for the unit, which determines specific NPC
    behavior and interaction capabilities.
  description: The GetNpcFlags2 method returns the NPCFlags2 value associated with
    a Unit object, representing a specific set of flags that define how the NPC interacts
    with players and other game entities. This value is used to determine whether
    an NPC can be interacted with through various means such as quest givers, vendor
    interactions, or gossip options. The method is commonly used in conjunction with
    other NPC-related functions to properly configure NPC behavior within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a NPCFlags2 value that represents specific flags for NPC interaction
    capabilities. This value can be used to determine what kind of interactions are
    possible with the NPC, such as whether it's a quest giver, vendor, or has other
    special behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetNPC();\nNPCFlags2 flags = unit->GetNpcFlags2();\n\
      if (flags & NPC_FLAG2_QUESTGIVER)\n{\n    // This NPC is a quest giver\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other NPC flag-related methods
    to determine complete NPC behavior. It's important to note that the NPCFlags2
    value may be modified by various game mechanics or scripts during runtime, so
    it should be checked regularly when needed.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying NPC flags directly as it can affect gameplay
    balance and interactions. Also, ensure that the unit object is valid before calling
    this method to avoid access violations.
