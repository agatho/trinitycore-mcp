documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's group health is critically low based on predefined
    thresholds.
  description: The IsGroupHealthCritical method evaluates the current health status
    of all group members to determine if the overall group health has fallen below
    a critical threshold. This method is typically used by AI systems or combat logic
    to trigger defensive behaviors, alert players, or initiate emergency healing protocols.
    It considers the health percentage of each group member and applies a weighted
    calculation to assess the collective group health state. The method does not modify
    any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combined health of all group members falls below the
    critical threshold, indicating that immediate action may be required. Returns
    false if the group's health is considered acceptable or above the defined critical
    level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI
    code: "if (analyzer.IsGroupHealthCritical()) {\n    // Trigger emergency healing\
      \ or defensive stance\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_EMERGENCY_HEAL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Group Management System
    code: "void CombatManager::CheckGroupStatus() {\n    if (combatAnalyzer.IsGroupHealthCritical())\
      \ {\n        // Notify all group members\n        SendGroupWarning(\"Group health\
      \ is critically low!\");\n        // Activate backup strategies\n        ActivateEmergencyProtocols();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the current state of group members' health and may
    not account for incoming heals or damage over time. The critical threshold value
    is likely configurable through game settings or constants within the CombatStateAnalyzer
    class. Performance-wise, this method should be called sparingly during high-frequency
    combat updates to avoid unnecessary computational overhead.
  warnings: The method assumes that group members are properly initialized and tracked
    by the system. If used outside of a valid group context, results may be unpredictable.
    Additionally, the critical health threshold might vary depending on player level
    or encounter difficulty, so developers should verify these values in their specific
    game environment.
