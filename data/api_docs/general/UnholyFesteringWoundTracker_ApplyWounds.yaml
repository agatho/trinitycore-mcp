  class: UnholyFesteringWoundTracker
  method: ApplyWounds
  signature: void UnholyFesteringWoundTracker::ApplyWounds(int guid, uint32 count)
documentation:
  brief: Applies festering wounds to a target based on the provided GUID and count.
  description: The ApplyWounds method is responsible for applying festering wound
    effects to a specified target in the game world. This method takes a unique identifier
    (GUID) of the target and a count indicating how many wounds should be applied.
    It is typically used in the context of Unholy Death Knight abilities, specifically
    related to the Festering Wound mechanic that causes periodic damage over time.
    The method likely modifies the target's aura state or applies a debuff that accumulates
    damage ticks based on the specified count.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply festering
      wounds to. This is typically a player or creature GUID used to identify the
      specific target in the game world.
  - name: count
    description: The number of festering wounds to apply to the target. This determines
      how many wound effects are active on the target, potentially affecting damage
      accumulation and tick behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ApplyWounds
    code: 'UnholyFesteringWoundTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyWounds(12345, 3); // Applies 3 festering wounds to target with
      GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying wounds to a player target
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    UnholyFesteringWoundTracker\
      \ tracker;\n    tracker.ApplyWounds(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), 5);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the Death Knight's Unholy specialization mechanics.
    The actual implementation may involve updating aura stacks, damage tick calculations,
    or maintaining internal state for wound tracking. Developers should ensure that
    GUIDs are valid and that the target exists before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling ApplyWounds with an invalid GUID or non-existent target can lead
    to crashes or unexpected behavior. Ensure proper validation of the target unit
    before invoking this method. The count parameter should be validated to prevent
    excessive wound accumulation which may cause performance issues or game balance
    problems.
