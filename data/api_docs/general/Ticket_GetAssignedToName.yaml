  class: Ticket
  method: GetAssignedToName
  signature: int Ticket::GetAssignedToName() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the player to whom the ticket is assigned.
  description: The GetAssignedToName method returns the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the player who is currently assigned to handle the support ticket. This identifier
    is used internally by the TrinityCore server to track which gm or player account
    is responsible for resolving the ticket. The method does not perform any validation
    on whether the assigned player actually exists in the database, and it simply
    returns the stored value from the ticket's internal data structure. This function
    is typically called when displaying ticket information in the GM interface or
    when checking assignment status during ticket resolution.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the player assigned to handle this
    ticket. Returns 0 if no player is assigned to the ticket.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Ticket* ticket = sTicketMgr->GetTicketByGuid(ticketGuid);\nif (ticket)\n\
      {\n    uint32 assignedTo = ticket->GetAssignedToName();\n    if (assignedTo\
      \ != 0)\n    {\n        // Ticket is assigned to player with GUID 'assignedTo'\n\
      \        printf(\"Ticket assigned to player GUID: %u\\n\", assignedTo);\n  \
      \  }\n    else\n    {\n        // Ticket is not assigned to any player\n   \
      \     printf(\"Ticket is unassigned.\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns an integer value which represents the GUID of the assigned
    player, not their name. The actual player name would need to be retrieved separately
    using the GUID through the player manager or database lookup.
