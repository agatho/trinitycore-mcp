    event)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all registered subscribers of a bot spawn event
  description: The NotifySubscribers method dispatches a given bot spawn event to
    all currently registered subscribers within the BotSpawnEventBus. This method
    is typically used in World of Warcraft TrinityCore environments to propagate events
    related to bot creation, initialization, or spawning. It ensures that any system
    components interested in monitoring or reacting to bot spawn activities are informed
    accordingly. The method operates synchronously and will iterate through all registered
    listeners, invoking their event handling callbacks with the provided event data.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: A shared pointer to a BotSpawnEvent object containing details about
      the bot spawning event that needs to be broadcasted to subscribers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSpawnEvent> spawnEvent = std::make_shared<BotSpawnEvent>(botGuid,
      botName);

      bus.NotifySubscribers(spawnEvent);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Event Data
    code: 'auto event = std::make_shared<BotSpawnEvent>(playerGuid, "TestBot");

      event->SetSpawnLocation({100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f});

      bus.NotifySubscribers(event);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that subscribers have been properly registered via the
    appropriate registration mechanism (e.g., Subscribe()). The event object passed
    to this method must remain valid for the duration of the notification process.
    If multiple threads are involved, care should be taken to ensure thread safety
    when modifying subscriber lists or accessing shared event data.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null shared_ptr; doing so will likely result
    in a crash or undefined behavior. Also, avoid modifying the subscriber list during
    notification to prevent potential race conditions or iterator invalidation issues.
