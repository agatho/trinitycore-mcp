  signature: bool PhaseInfoStruct::IsAllowedInArea(uint32 areaId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified area ID is allowed for the current phase.
  description: The IsAllowedInArea method checks if a given area ID is permitted within
    the current phase context. This functionality is crucial for determining which
    areas players can access based on their current phase, such as during quest progression
    or event-based content. The method evaluates the internal phase restrictions against
    the provided area identifier to return a boolean result indicating access permission.
    It's commonly used in conjunction with phase management systems to control player
    visibility and interaction within different game zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified area ID is allowed in the current phase,
    false otherwise. The method does not throw exceptions but may return false for
    invalid or restricted areas.
  examples:
  - title: Check Area Access in Current Phase
    code: "uint32 currentArea = player->GetAreaId();\nif (phaseInfo.IsAllowedInArea(currentArea))\
      \ {\n    // Player can access this area\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      You may enter this area.\");\n} else {\n    // Player cannot access this area\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Access denied to this area.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal phase data structures that are typically populated
    during phase initialization or when phase changes occur. The performance impact
    is minimal as it performs a simple lookup operation, but frequent calls may indicate
    inefficient phase management logic.
