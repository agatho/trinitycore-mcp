  brief: Clears all charm-related flags from the pet's AI state
  description: The ClearCharmInfoFlags method resets all charm-related state flags
    within the PetAI class, effectively removing any active charm or control states
    that have been applied to the pet. This method is typically invoked when a pet's
    charm status is removed or when transitioning between different AI states. The
    operation ensures that the pet returns to its normal behavior pattern without
    any lingering charm effects. This method does not directly interact with the pet's
    database entry but modifies internal AI state flags used for behavior management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear charm flags when releasing a pet
    code: "void Player::ReleasePet()\n{\n    if (Pet* pet = GetPet())\n    {\n   \
      \     pet->GetAI()->ClearCharmInfoFlags();\n        // Additional release logic...\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI state management system and should
    only be called when appropriate charm state transitions occur. It's typically
    invoked automatically by the core when charm effects expire or are explicitly
    removed.
  warnings: Calling this method inappropriately may result in inconsistent AI behavior
    or unexpected pet actions. Ensure that charm-related flags are properly managed
    to avoid conflicts with other AI systems.
