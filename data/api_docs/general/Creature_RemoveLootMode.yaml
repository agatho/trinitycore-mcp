  class: Creature
  method: RemoveLootMode
  signature: void Creature::RemoveLootMode(uint16 lootMode)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific loot mode from the creature's loot list.
  description: This method removes a specified loot mode from the creature's loot
    list, effectively disabling that particular loot mode for the creature. The method
    is typically used in scenarios where certain loot modes need to be excluded from
    the creature's drop list, such as when implementing custom loot rules or modifying
    default loot behavior. It operates on the creature's internal loot system and
    affects how loot is generated during the creature's death.
  parameters:
  - name: lootMode
    description: The loot mode to remove from the creature's loot list. This represents
      a specific loot mode that can be removed, typically corresponding to a particular
      type of loot (e.g., 1 for default loot, 2 for heroic loot, etc.).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Default Loot Mode
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->RemoveLootMode(1); // Remove default loot mode'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly impacts the creature's
    loot behavior. It may affect how loot is generated during creature death and could
    interfere with existing loot tables if not properly handled.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect loot generation or removal
    of important loot modes, potentially causing issues with quest progression or
    loot distribution.
