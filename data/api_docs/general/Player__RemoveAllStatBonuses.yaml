  brief: Removes all stat bonuses from the player character
  description: This method removes all stat bonuses that have been applied to the
    player character, effectively resetting the character's stats to their base values.
    It is typically used during character level-up or when removing temporary buffs
    that affect attributes such as strength, agility, intellect, and stamina. The
    method ensures that no stat bonuses remain active on the player, allowing for
    accurate calculation of base stats.

    managing character stat updates. It should be used carefully as it may affect
    gameplay balance if not handled properly.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect stat calculations and
    potentially affect gameplay mechanics such as combat performance or spell casting.
