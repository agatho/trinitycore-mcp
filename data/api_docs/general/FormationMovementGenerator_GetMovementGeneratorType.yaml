  class: FormationMovementGenerator
  method: GetMovementGeneratorType
  signature: int FormationMovementGenerator::GetMovementGeneratorType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement generator type identifier for formation-based movement.
  description: The GetMovementGeneratorType method retrieves the unique integer identifier
    associated with the FormationMovementGenerator class. This identifier is used
    internally by the TrinityCore AI system to distinguish different types of movement
    generators and ensure proper behavior during creature movement operations. The
    returned value typically corresponds to a predefined enum or constant that represents
    formation-based movement logic within the game's movement system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the movement generator type identifier for formation-based
    movement. This value is used by the AI system to categorize and manage different
    movement behaviors in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "FormationMovementGenerator* movementGen = new FormationMovementGenerator();\n\
      int type = movementGen->GetMovementGeneratorType();\n// type will contain the\
      \ identifier for formation movement\nif (type == FORMATION_MOVEMENT)\n{\n  \
      \  // Handle formation movement logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization and movement management.
    The exact integer value returned may vary depending on the implementation within
    TrinityCore's movement generator system, but it should consistently identify formation-based
    movement across all instances of this class.
