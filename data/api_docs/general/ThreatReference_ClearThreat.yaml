  class: ThreatReference
  method: ClearThreat
  signature: void ThreatReference::ClearThreat()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all threat values from the ThreatReference object, effectively clearing
    the threat list for the associated unit.
  description: The ClearThreat method removes all threat entries from the ThreatReference
    object, resetting the threat state for the unit it references. This is typically
    used when a creature or player should no longer have any threat on a target, such
    as when switching targets, despawning, or when threat is intentionally cleared
    during combat mechanics. The method ensures that the threat list is emptied without
    leaving any residual entries that could affect AI behavior or combat calculations.
    It's commonly called internally by the core AI system when managing mob targeting
    and threat distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing threat on a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      ThreatReference* threatRef = creature->GetThreatManager().GetThreatReference();

      threatRef->ClearThreat();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the core AI system and should generally
    not be called directly from custom scripts unless you're implementing specific
    threat management logic. The operation is atomic and does not trigger any additional
    callbacks or events.
  warnings: Calling ClearThreat on a ThreatReference that is actively being used by
    the AI system may cause unexpected behavior in target switching or combat mechanics.
    Ensure that this method is only called when it's safe to clear all threat without
    affecting ongoing combat states.
