  class: MailSender
  method: MailSender
  signature: void MailSender::MailSender(uint32 senderEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a mail sender with the specified entry ID for use in sending
    mails.
  description: The MailSender constructor initializes a mail sender object using the
    provided sender entry ID. This entry typically corresponds to a creature or game
    object that acts as the sender of a mail message. The method sets up internal
    state required for mail operations, including validating the sender entry and
    preparing necessary data structures for sending mails in the TrinityCore framework.
    This constructor is usually called when creating a new mail system instance or
    when configuring a specific mail sender for a particular game context.
  parameters:
  - name: senderEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the creature or game object that
      will act as the mail sender. This value typically corresponds to an entry in
      the creature_template table and must be a valid, existing game object entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic MailSender Initialization
    code: 'MailSender sender(12345);

      // Initializes a mail sender with entry ID 12345 (e.g., a mail box or NPC)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using MailSender with Creature Entry
    code: 'uint32 mailBoxEntry = 10001;

      MailSender postmasterSender(mailBoxEntry);

      // Creates a mail sender for a postmaster or mailbox with entry ID 10001'
    language: cpp
  notes: The MailSender constructor does not perform any validation on the provided
    entry ID. It is assumed that the caller provides a valid entry that exists in
    the game database. The actual mail sending functionality requires additional setup
    and calls to other methods in the mail system.
  warnings: Using an invalid or non-existent senderEntry may lead to undefined behavior
    or runtime errors when attempting to send mails. Always ensure that the entry
    ID corresponds to a valid creature or game object in the database before calling
    this constructor.
