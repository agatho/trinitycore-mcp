  signature: void EconomyManager::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the economy manager system, cleaning up resources and stopping
    all active economy-related processes.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the EconomyManager
    subsystem within TrinityCore. This method ensures that all active economy-related
    processes are halted, resources are properly released, and any pending transactions
    or operations are either completed or rolled back. It typically gets invoked during
    server shutdown sequences to prevent data corruption or inconsistent states. The
    method does not accept any parameters and performs no return value operations.
    It is designed to be thread-safe and should only be called when the server is
    in a state where it can safely terminate subsystems without affecting ongoing
    player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: EconomyManager::Shutdown();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during server shutdown or maintenance procedures.
    Calling it during active gameplay may result in unexpected behavior or data loss.
    The method internally handles cleanup of all economy-related data structures and
    ensures that no dangling references remain.
  warnings: Do not invoke this method while players are actively engaged in economy
    transactions, as it may cause transaction failures or data inconsistencies. Ensure
    the server is in a safe state before calling Shutdown to avoid disrupting player
    experience.
