  method: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::InterruptCoordinatorFixed(const InterruptCoordinatorFixed
    & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Constructs a new InterruptCoordinatorFixed object as a copy of an existing
    InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance.
  description: The InterruptCoordinatorFixed constructor is a copy constructor that
    initializes a new InterruptCoordinatorFixed object with the values from an existing
    InterruptCoordinatorFixed object. This method is typically used when creating
    a duplicate of an interrupt coordinator, which manages the interruption logic
    for various game events such as spell casting or ability usage. The copied object
    will have identical state and configuration to the source object, ensuring consistent
    behavior in interrupt handling scenarios within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The existing InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance to be copied. This
      parameter represents the source object whose state will be replicated in the
      newly constructed object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying an InterruptCoordinatorFixed Instance
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed originalCoordinator;

      // ... configure originalCoordinator ...

      InterruptCoordinatorFixed newCoordinator(originalCoordinator); // Copy constructor
      usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. The copied object will
    share the same interrupt handling logic and state as the source object, but will
    be an independent instance in memory.
