  brief: Initializes a new PvP combat profile for a player
  description: The PvPCombatProfile constructor initializes a new PvP combat profile,
    setting up internal data structures and default values required for tracking player
    versus player combat statistics and behaviors. This method is typically called
    when a player enters PvP combat mode or when a new PvP profile needs to be created
    for gameplay tracking purposes. The initialization process includes setting up
    timers, counters, and state variables necessary for accurate PvP combat logging
    and scoring.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new PvP combat profile
    code: 'PvPCombatProfile profile;

      profile.PvPCombatProfile(); // Initializes the profile'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically invoked automatically by the TrinityCore framework
    when a player enters PvP zones or engages in PvP combat. Developers should not
    need to manually call this constructor unless implementing custom PvP logic or
    testing scenarios.
