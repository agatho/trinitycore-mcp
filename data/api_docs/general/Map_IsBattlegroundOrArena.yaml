documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current map is a battleground or arena.
  description: This method checks if the map instance represents a battleground or
    arena type map. It returns true if the map is classified as either a battleground
    or arena, and false otherwise. The method is commonly used in game logic to distinguish
    between player versus player content and player versus player content that requires
    special handling. This functionality is essential for determining appropriate
    game mechanics such as scoring, rewards, and player interaction rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map is a battleground or arena, false otherwise. The
    method does not return null values as it is a boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (map->IsBattlegroundOrArena())\n{\n    // Handle battleground/arena\
      \ specific logic\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It relies on
    internal map flags to determine the type, making it efficient for frequent checks
    during gameplay.
  warnings: No significant warnings. This method should not be used as a replacement
    for more specific map type checks in complex scenarios where precise categorization
    is needed.
