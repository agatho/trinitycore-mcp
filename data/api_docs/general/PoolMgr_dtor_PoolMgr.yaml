  signature: void PoolMgr::~PoolMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the PoolMgr instance and cleans up all associated pooled resources.
  description: The ~PoolMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up all
    memory and resources allocated by the PoolMgr singleton. This includes releasing
    all pool objects, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring no memory leaks
    occur during shutdown. The destructor is automatically invoked when the PoolMgr
    instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures that all pooled
    entities are correctly deallocated and that the system state remains consistent
    upon destruction.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at program exit
    code: "int main() {\n    // PoolMgr is created as a singleton\n    // ...\n  \
      \  return 0; // Destructor automatically called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor should not be called manually unless explicitly managing
    the singleton instance. The PoolMgr is typically managed as a global singleton,
    so manual destruction is rare. Ensure all references to pooled objects are cleared
    before the destructor runs to prevent dangling pointers.
