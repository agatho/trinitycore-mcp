  signature: void GuildIntegration::MentorJuniorMembers(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Mentors junior guild members by assigning them to a senior member for guidance.
  description: The MentorJuniorMembers method facilitates the guild mentorship system
    in TrinityCore, where a senior guild member (mentor) is assigned to guide junior
    members. This method likely iterates through all junior guild members and assigns
    them to an appropriate mentor based on guild hierarchy or configuration settings.
    The assignment process may involve updating player records within the guild structure
    and potentially triggering in-game notifications or quest assignments related
    to mentoring. It's designed to support the game's social integration and character
    progression mechanics by encouraging experienced players to help newer ones.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player identifier (GUID) of
      the junior member to be mentored. The value is expected to be a valid player
      GUID within the guild context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mentor Assignment
    code: 'int juniorPlayerGuid = 12345;

      GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.MentorJuniorMembers(&juniorPlayerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guild member database and may require
    the player to be part of a guild. It might also involve checking for existing
    mentorship assignments to prevent conflicts.
  warnings: Ensure that the player GUID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual
    guild member, otherwise undefined behavior or errors may occur.
