  class: Player
  method: ActivateTalentGroup
  signature: void Player::ActivateTalentGroup(const ChrSpecializationEntry * spec)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a talent specialization group for the player, enabling the use
    of specified talents.
  description: The ActivateTalentGroup method is used to enable a specific talent
    specialization group for a player character. This method typically activates one
    of the two available talent specializations (Destruction, Affliction, Demonology,
    or Havoc for Warlocks; Balance, Feral, Guardian, or Restoration for Druids; etc.)
    and allows the player to use talents from that specialization. It is commonly
    used in conjunction with other methods like ResetTalents to manage talent points
    and specialization changes during gameplay. The method does not directly modify
    the player's talent points but rather sets up the active specialization group
    for the character.
  parameters:
  - name: spec
    description: Pointer to the ChrSpecializationEntry structure that defines which
      specialization group to activate. This parameter specifies the particular specialization
      to enable, typically corresponding to one of the player's available talent specializations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Activating a Warlock Specialization
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();


      // Assuming we have a valid ChrSpecializationEntry pointer for a Warlock specialization

      ChrSpecializationEntry* spec = GetChrSpecializationEntry(10);

      player->ActivateTalentGroup(spec);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when changing
    specializations. It should be used in conjunction with ResetTalents to ensure
    proper talent point management. The method does not directly affect the player's
    talent points but rather activates a specific specialization group.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect specialization activation,
    potentially causing confusion during gameplay or leading to incorrect talent point
    distribution. Ensure that the spec parameter corresponds to an actual valid specialization.
