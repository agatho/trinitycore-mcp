  class: Unit
  method: GetInsideAreaTriggers
  signature: const int & Unit::GetInsideAreaTriggers() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of area triggers currently inside the unit's collision
    volume.
  description: This method retrieves the count of area triggers that are currently
    intersecting with the unit's collision volume. It is used primarily for game mechanics
    involving area of effect spells, environmental effects, and collision detection.
    The method returns an integer value representing the number of active area triggers
    within the unit's bounds. This functionality is essential for determining whether
    a unit is affected by certain area-based spells or environmental hazards.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the count of area triggers currently inside
    the unit's collision volume. A value of 0 indicates no active area triggers, while
    positive values indicate the number of triggers currently intersecting with the
    unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int triggerCount = unit->GetInsideAreaTriggers();\nif (triggerCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is inside area triggers\n    // Perform appropriate actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other collision detection
    methods. The value returned may change dynamically as area triggers are added
    or removed from the unit's collision volume. Performance considerations include
    frequent calls to this method during combat situations, which may impact frame
    rate.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in combat situations, as frequent
    calls can impact performance. Also note that this method returns a reference to
    an internal value, so modifying the returned value directly could affect the unit's
    state.
