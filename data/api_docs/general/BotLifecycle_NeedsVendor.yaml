  method: NeedsVendor
  signature: bool BotLifecycle::NeedsVendor() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot requires vendor interaction for item management
    or resource replenishment.
  description: The NeedsVendor method evaluates the current state of the bot to determine
    if it needs to visit a vendor for purchasing items, repairing equipment, or restocking
    consumables. This method typically checks the bot's inventory levels, equipment
    condition, and resource requirements against predefined thresholds. It is commonly
    used in bot AI logic to trigger vendor-related behaviors such as pathfinding to
    the nearest vendor, initiating purchase sequences, or scheduling restock operations.
    The result of this check directly influences the bot's decision-making process
    within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot requires vendor interaction based on its current
    inventory state and resource needs; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Loop
    code: "if (bot->GetLifecycle()->NeedsVendor()) {\n    bot->MoveToNearestVendor();\n\
      \    bot->PerformVendorInteraction();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot State Management
    code: "void BotAI::Update() {\n    if (m_botLifecycle->NeedsVendor()) {\n    \
      \    m_state = BotState::VENDOR;\n        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with\
      \ other AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks on inventory and equipment state
    without triggering expensive database operations. The exact conditions for returning
    true are implementation-specific and typically involve thresholds defined in bot
    configuration files or global constants.
  warnings: The method should not be called excessively in tight loops as it might
    indirectly trigger state updates or database queries that could impact performance.
    Always cache the result when multiple checks are needed within a single AI cycle.
