  method: GetRandCharExclude
  signature: int AuctionBotConfig::GetRandCharExclude(int exclude) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a random character index excluding the specified value for auction
    bot configuration.
  description: The GetRandCharExclude method generates and returns a random integer
    representing a character index, while ensuring that the provided exclude value
    is not returned. This method is typically used in auction bot functionality to
    avoid selecting specific characters or indices during random operations. The implementation
    likely uses a random number generator seeded appropriately for consistent behavior
    within the auction bot system. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is designed to be called repeatedly with different exclude values to generate
    sequences of unique character indices.
  parameters:
  - name: exclude
    description: The integer value that should be excluded from the random selection.
      This represents a character index that should not be returned by the method.
  returns: An integer representing a randomly selected character index, guaranteed
    to be different from the exclude parameter. The return value typically falls within
    the valid range of character indices supported by the auction bot configuration
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int randomIndex = auctionBotConfig.GetRandCharExclude(5); // Returns random
      index not equal to 5
    language: cpp
  - title: Generating Multiple Unique Indices
    code: 'int first = auctionBotConfig.GetRandCharExclude(-1); // Get first random
      index

      int second = auctionBotConfig.GetRandCharExclude(first); // Get second random
      index, different from first'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger auction bot configuration system that
    manages character assignments for automated auction activities. The exclude parameter
    allows the caller to avoid previously selected indices when generating sequences
    of random values. Implementation may involve internal state tracking or use of
    a pseudo-random number generator with appropriate seeding.
  warnings: Ensure that the exclude value is within valid bounds expected by the system,
    otherwise behavior may be undefined or cause unexpected results. Repeated calls
    with the same exclude value may lead to infinite loops if all possible values
    are excluded.
