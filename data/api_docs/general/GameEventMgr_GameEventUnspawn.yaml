documentation:
  brief: Removes all game event objects and creatures from the world for the specified
    event ID.
  description: The GameEventUnspawn method is responsible for cleaning up and removing
    all spawned game event entities, including creatures, game objects, and other
    associated elements, from the game world for a given event ID. This function ensures
    that any resources allocated during the activation of a game event are properly
    released and that the world state is restored to its pre-event condition. It typically
    gets called when a game event ends or needs to be manually terminated before its
    natural conclusion. The method operates on the event ID provided as a parameter,
    which identifies the specific game event whose spawned elements should be removed.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to unspawn. This integer
      value corresponds to the ID defined in the game event database entries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Unspawn a game event by ID
    code: GameEventMgr::instance()->GameEventUnspawn(1234);
    language: cpp
  - title: Unspawn all active events before server shutdown
    code: "for (int16 i = 0; i < sGameEventMgr->GetEventSize(); ++i)\n{\n    if (sGameEventMgr->IsActiveEvent(i))\n\
      \        sGameEventMgr->GameEventUnspawn(i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not remove the event definition itself from memory; it only
    unspawns the objects associated with that event. It is generally safe to call
    this method multiple times for the same event ID, though it will have no effect
    on already-unspawned events. The method may cause a performance impact if many
    game objects are active during an event, as it iterates through and removes each
    one.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent event ID may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Ensure that the event ID is valid and corresponds
    to an active event before calling this function. Additionally, be cautious when
    unspawning events during active gameplay, as it might cause visual glitches or
    inconsistencies if not handled carefully.
