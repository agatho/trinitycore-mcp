  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: CreateCharacterForAccount
  signature: int BotCharacterSelector::CreateCharacterForAccount(uint32 accountId,
    const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot character for the specified account ID using the provided
    request data.
  description: The CreateCharacterForAccount method is responsible for generating
    a new bot character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes an account identifier
    and a request object that defines the parameters for character creation. This
    method integrates with the core game systems to ensure proper initialization of
    the bot character, including setting up default attributes, inventory, and other
    essential properties. The method performs validation on the input data to prevent
    invalid character creation attempts and returns a status code indicating success
    or failure of the operation.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account for which the bot character is being
      created. Must be a valid, existing account ID in the database.
  - name: request
    description: Reference to an integer request parameter that contains configuration
      data or flags for character creation. The specific meaning of this value depends
      on the implementation and may control aspects such as character class, race,
      or other predefined settings.
  returns: Returns an integer status code indicating the result of the character creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values
    may represent various error conditions such as invalid account ID, insufficient
    resources, or failed validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Character Creation
    code: "int result = botSelector->CreateCharacterForAccount(12345, 0);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Character created successfully\n    printf(\"Bot character\
      \ created for account 12345\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle error based on return\
      \ value\n    printf(\"Failed to create bot character: %d\\n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Character Creation with Custom Request
    code: "int customRequest = 100; // Example flag for specific character type\n\
      int result = botSelector->CreateCharacterForAccount(98765, customRequest);\n\
      if (result >= 0) {\n    printf(\"Bot character created with request %d\\n\"\
      , customRequest);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Error creating character: %d\\n\"\
      , result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with database operations to store the new character
    data. Developers should ensure that the account ID exists before calling this
    method, as invalid IDs may lead to undefined behavior or database errors. The
    request parameter's interpretation is implementation-specific and should be documented
    in the broader context of bot management systems.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the accountId can result
    in database corruption or failed operations. The request parameter must be carefully
    managed to avoid unintended character configurations. This method may not be thread-safe,
    so concurrent calls from multiple threads should be synchronized.
