  brief: Modifies cooldowns for spells by category.
  description: This method adjusts the cooldown period of spells that belong to the
    same category as the current spell. It is commonly used in conjunction with other
    cooldown-related effects to modify how frequently a player can use certain types
    of abilities. The method typically affects the cooldown duration of spells within
    the same category, potentially reducing or increasing the time between uses.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell effect system and should be used carefully
    during spell processing to avoid unintended side effects. It may interact with
    other cooldown modifiers in complex ways depending on the specific spell being
    processed.
  warnings: Using this method without proper context can lead to incorrect cooldown
    behavior, especially if multiple cooldown effects are applied simultaneously.
    Care must be taken to ensure that the category is correctly identified and that
    the effect does not interfere with other spell mechanics.
