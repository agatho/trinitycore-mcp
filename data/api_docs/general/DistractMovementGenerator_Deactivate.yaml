  class: DistractMovementGenerator
  method: Deactivate
  signature: void DistractMovementGenerator::Deactivate(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the distract movement generator, stopping any ongoing distraction
    behavior.
  description: The Deactivate method is used to halt the execution of a distract movement
    generator. This typically occurs when the AI system needs to stop a creature from
    being distracted by an external stimulus, such as when the target is no longer
    valid or when the distraction effect should be removed. The method ensures that
    any active movement or behavior related to the distraction is properly terminated
    and cleaned up. It is part of the movement generator pattern used in TrinityCore's
    AI system for controlling NPC behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter, likely used for internal state management
      or flags during deactivation process.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deactivation Usage
    code: 'DistractMovementGenerator* distractGen = new DistractMovementGenerator();

      int flag = 0;

      distractGen->Deactivate(&flag);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the AI system when a distraction
    needs to be cancelled or when the movement generator is being destroyed. The parameter
    may be used for debugging or tracking internal states, but its exact usage depends
    on implementation details within TrinityCore's AI framework.
  warnings: Improper use of this method could lead to inconsistent AI behavior or
    memory leaks if not properly integrated with the rest of the movement generator
    lifecycle management system.
