  class: ThreatReference
  method: GetTauntState
  signature: TauntState ThreatReference::GetTauntState() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current taunt state of the threat reference.
  description: The GetTauntState method returns the current taunt state of a ThreatReference
    object, which indicates whether the target is currently taunted by an attacker.
    This is used in AI behavior to determine if a mob should continue attacking a
    specific target or switch targets. The returned TauntState enum typically represents
    different states such as TAUNTED, NOT_TAUNTED, or TAUNT_EXPIRED. This method does
    not modify any internal state and can be called safely during combat routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: A TauntState enumeration value indicating the current taunt status of the
    threat reference. Possible values include TAUNTED (target is currently taunted),
    NOT_TAUNTED (target is not taunted), and TAUNT_EXPIRED (taunt has expired).
  examples:
  - title: Check if a target is taunted before attacking
    code: "if (threatRef->GetTauntState() == TAUNTED)\n{\n    // Target is taunted,\
      \ continue attacking\n    attacker->Attack(threatRef->GetTarget());\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    // Target is not taunted, consider switching targets\n    attacker->SelectNewTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use taunt state in AI decision making
    code: "void AIUpdate(Unit* target)\n{\n    ThreatReference* threatRef = target->GetThreatManager().GetThreatReference(target);\n\
      \    if (threatRef)\n    {\n        TauntState state = threatRef->GetTauntState();\n\
      \        switch (state)\n        {\n            case TAUNTED:\n            \
      \    // Maintain current target\n                break;\n            case NOT_TAUNTED:\n\
      \                // Consider taunting or switching targets\n               \
      \ break;\n            case TAUNT_EXPIRED:\n                // Target no longer\
      \ taunted, may be safe to attack\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with threat management systems
    within the TrinityCore AI framework. The returned TauntState value should not
    be modified directly as it reflects the current state of taunt mechanics in the
    game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the ThreatReference object is valid before calling this method,
    as accessing a null reference may lead to undefined behavior. Also note that taunt
    states can change rapidly during combat, so caching results may lead to stale
    data.
