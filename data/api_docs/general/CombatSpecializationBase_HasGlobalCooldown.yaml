  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::HasGlobalCooldown() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat specialization has an active global cooldown.
  description: The HasGlobalCooldown method checks if the current combat specialization
    is currently under a global cooldown effect. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    implementation, this typically relates to abilities or spells that are subject
    to a global cooldown period after being used. This method is commonly used in
    spell and ability processing logic to prevent immediate reactivation of skills
    during cooldown phases. The check is performed against the specialization's internal
    cooldown state and does not consider individual ability cooldowns.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat specialization has an active global cooldown,
    false otherwise. This indicates whether any abilities within this specialization
    are currently restricted from being used due to a global cooldown timer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Processing
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->HasGlobalCooldown()) {\n    // Prevent\
      \ spell casting or show cooldown message\n    SendSpellFailed(player, spellId,\
      \ SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Before Ability Activation
    code: "CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();\nif\
      \ (!spec->HasGlobalCooldown()) {\n    // Proceed with ability execution\n  \
      \  spec->ActivateAbility(spellId);\n} else {\n    // Handle cooldown state\n\
      \    SendSpellFailed(player, spellId, SPELL_FAILED_NOT_READY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell casting validation and ability
    activation checks. It's important to note that global cooldowns are usually managed
    per-player or per-specialization rather than per-individual ability. The implementation
    may also consider the player's current state (e.g., dead, stunned) when determining
    if a global cooldown should be applied.
  warnings: This method should not be used as a sole determinant for spell casting
    success. Always combine with other validation checks like mana requirements, target
    validity, and spell-specific restrictions. Additionally, global cooldowns may
    be suppressed in certain game states or by specific buffs/debuffs.
