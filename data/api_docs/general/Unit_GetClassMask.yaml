  class: Unit
  method: GetClassMask
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetClassMask() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the class mask value of the unit, indicating its character class.
  description: The GetClassMask method retrieves the class mask associated with a
    Unit object, which represents the character class of the entity. This value is
    used internally by TrinityCore to determine the type of class a unit belongs to,
    such as Warrior, Paladin, Rogue, etc. The method is commonly used in game logic
    for identifying and handling different class types within the game mechanics.
    It returns a uint32 value representing the bitmask of the class, which can be
    used for comparison or filtering purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the class mask of the unit. This value
    corresponds to the bitmask of the character class, such as 1 for Warrior, 2 for
    Paladin, 4 for Hunter, etc., allowing developers to identify and distinguish different
    classes within the game.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 classMask = unit->GetClassMask();\nif (classMask & CLASS_MASK_WARRIOR)\
      \ {\n    // Handle warrior class\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other class-related methods
    and should be used carefully when checking against specific class masks. Performance
    considerations are minimal as this is a simple getter method.
  warnings: The returned value may not be directly usable for comparison without proper
    masking operations; developers should ensure that the bitmask values are correctly
    interpreted to avoid logic errors.
