  class: Item
  method: SetItemZoneFlag
  signature: void Item::SetItemZoneFlag(ItemZoneFlags flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the zone flag for an item, determining its applicable zone context.
  description: The SetItemZoneFlag method assigns a specific zone flag to an Item
    object, which controls the zone-based behavior and restrictions of the item. This
    flag influences how the item interacts with zone-specific game mechanics such
    as zone-based quest completion, area triggers, or zone-based item requirements.
    The method is typically used during item creation or modification processes to
    ensure proper zone context is maintained. It affects the item's usability within
    specific zones and may impact its interaction with zone-based content.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetItemZoneFlag(ZONE_FLAG_0);

      // Sets item to zone flag 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = Item::CreateItem(12345, player);

      item->SetItemZoneFlag(ZONE_FLAG_1);

      // Sets item to zone flag 1 for specific zone context'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item-related methods
    such as SetOwnerGUID or SetSlot. The implementation may vary depending on the
    item's type and whether it's a temporary or permanent item. Performance considerations
    are minimal, but thread safety should be noted when modifying items during gameplay.
  warnings: Improper use of zone flags can lead to items being unusable in certain
    zones or failing to meet zone-specific requirements. Care must be taken when setting
    zone flags for items that may interact with specific zone-based content.
