  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: DeactivateStrategy
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::DeactivateStrategy(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates a behavior strategy based on the provided flags.
  description: The DeactivateStrategy method within the AdaptiveBehaviorManager class
    is responsible for disabling or deactivating specific behavior strategies within
    the AI system. This method takes a set of flags that define which strategies should
    be deactivated. The implementation likely manages an internal state or list of
    active strategies and modifies this based on the provided flag values. This functionality
    allows for dynamic control over AI behaviors during runtime, enabling conditional
    activation or deactivation of different strategic components depending on game
    conditions or events.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask value that specifies which behavior strategies to deactivate.
      Each bit in the flag represents a different strategy or behavior component within
      the AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deactivate a single strategy
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      behaviorManager->DeactivateStrategy(0x01); // Deactivates the first strategy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Deactivate multiple strategies
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = ...;

      uint32 strategyFlags = 0x01 | 0x04 | 0x10; // Deactivates strategies 1, 3, and
      5

      behaviorManager->DeactivateStrategy(strategyFlags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal strategy registry or list. The
    flag system suggests that multiple strategies can be controlled simultaneously
    through bitwise operations. It's important to understand the specific flag values
    used by the AI system to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect flag values may cause unexpected deactivation of strategies,
    potentially leading to AI behavior anomalies. Ensure that flag values align with
    the expected strategy definitions in the AI subsystem.
