documentation:
  brief: Applies artifact powers from an item to the player's artifact
  description: This method applies artifact powers from a specified item to the player's
    artifact, enabling or disabling artifact power effects based on the apply parameter.
    It is used in conjunction with artifact system mechanics to manage artifact power
    application and removal. The method handles artifact power application through
    item-based artifact powers, allowing for dynamic artifact power management during
    gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to the Item object from which artifact powers are applied.
      Must be a valid item with artifact power properties.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      artifact powers. When true, artifact powers are applied; when false, they are
      removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Artifact Power Application
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* artifactItem = player->GetItemBySlot(0);

      player->ApplyArtifactPowers(artifactItem, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Artifact Power Removal Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Item* artifactItem = player->GetItemBySlot(12);

      player->ApplyArtifactPowers(artifactItem, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in artifact system implementation and requires
    proper item validation. The method may trigger artifact power updates and could
    affect player's artifact progression.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to artifact power inconsistencies
    or incorrect artifact progression. Ensure that the item parameter is valid before
    calling this method.
