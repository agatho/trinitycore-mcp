documentation:
  brief: Moves a MapManager object to another MapManager instance, transferring ownership
    of its resources.
  description: The MapManager move constructor transfers all resources from the source
    MapManager object to the current object. This operation is typically used when
    creating new MapManager instances or reassigning existing ones in a performance-critical
    context. The source object becomes invalid after the move and should not be used.
    This constructor is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics, allowing
    efficient resource transfer without deep copying. In the context of TrinityCore,
    this method supports efficient management of map-related data structures during
    server initialization or when handling dynamic map loading/unloading.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move MapManager to new variable
    code: 'MapManager&& sourceManager = std::move(sMapMgr);

      MapManager newManager(std::move(sourceManager));'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in function parameter
    code: "void ProcessMapManager(MapManager&& mgr) {\n    MapManager localMgr(std::move(mgr));\n\
      \    // Use localMgr\n}\n// Usage:\nProcessMapManager(std::move(sMapMgr));"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework.
    Developers should be aware that after a move operation, the source object's state
    becomes undefined and must not be accessed. The move constructor is noexcept and
    provides strong exception safety guarantees.
  warnings: Do not attempt to use the source MapManager object after moving it. Using
    moved-from objects can lead to undefined behavior. This constructor should only
    be used when you are certain that the source object will not be used afterward.
