  signature: int PvPCombatAI::GetWarlockDefensiveCooldowns(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of defensive cooldowns currently active on the warlock
    player.
  description: The GetWarlockDefensiveCooldowns method is used within the PvPCombatAI
    class to determine how many defensive abilities are currently on cooldown for
    a warlock player. This information is crucial for AI decision-making in PvP scenarios,
    as it helps the AI understand the warlock's available defensive options and plan
    accordingly. The method takes a pointer to a player object and returns an integer
    representing the count of active defensive cooldowns. It is typically used during
    combat analysis to evaluate the warlock's defensive capabilities at any given
    moment.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the warlock whose defensive
      cooldowns are being evaluated. This parameter must point to a valid player object,
      otherwise the behavior is undefined.
  returns: An integer value representing the number of defensive cooldowns currently
    active on the specified warlock player. A return value of 0 indicates no defensive
    cooldowns are active, while higher values indicate increasing numbers of active
    defensive abilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* warlock = ...; // Assume this is a valid warlock player\nint cooldownCount\
      \ = pvpAI->GetWarlockDefensiveCooldowns(warlock);\nif (cooldownCount == 0)\n\
      {\n    // Warlock has no defensive cooldowns active, AI can consider using defensive\
      \ abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage in Combat Decision Making
    code: "void PvPCombatAI::EvaluateWarlockDefensiveOptions(Player* warlock)\n{\n\
      \    int defensiveCooldowns = GetWarlockDefensiveCooldowns(warlock);\n    switch\
      \ (defensiveCooldowns)\n    {\n        case 0:\n            // No cooldowns,\
      \ consider using defensive abilities\n            break;\n        case 1:\n\
      \            // One cooldown active, be cautious with additional defensive usage\n\
      \            break;\n        default:\n            // Multiple cooldowns active,\
      \ avoid further defensive actions\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PvPCombatAI system and assumes that the player
    object passed in is a valid warlock class. The implementation likely checks for
    specific warlock defensive abilities such as 'Dark Pact', 'Unending Breath', or
    other defensive spells that have cooldowns. Performance-wise, this method should
    be relatively lightweight since it only counts active cooldowns rather than calculating
    their exact remaining time.
  warnings: Ensure the player pointer passed to this method is valid and points to
    a warlock class player object. Passing an invalid or non-warlock player may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect results. The method does not validate whether
    the player is actually in combat, so calling it outside of combat scenarios might
    return inaccurate information.
