documentation:
  brief: Assigns all member variables from another WorldSession object to this instance
  description: The assignment operator for WorldSession performs a deep copy of all
    member variables from the right-hand side WorldSession object to the left-hand
    side (this) object. This operation is typically used when duplicating session
    state or transferring session data between objects. The method ensures that all
    session-related data including player information, connection state, and client
    settings are properly copied. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this
    operator is crucial for managing session lifecycle operations such as session
    swapping during character login transitions or when handling multiple concurrent
    connections from the same client.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current WorldSession object (this) after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Usage
    code: 'WorldSession session1;

      WorldSession session2;

      // ... initialize session2 ...

      session1 = session2; // Copies all data from session2 to session1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'WorldSession session1, session2, session3;

      // ... initialize sessions ...

      session1 = session2 = session3; // Chained assignment

      // Both session1 and session2 now contain the same data as session3'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely performs deep copying of complex member variables including
    pointers to player objects, packet buffers, and connection-related data structures.
    The implementation may include special handling for thread-safe operations since
    WorldSession objects are accessed from multiple threads in TrinityCore's multi-threaded
    architecture.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this assignment operator with active sessions as
    it may cause unexpected behavior if the source session is actively processing
    packets or has ongoing network communication. The copied session may inherit state
    that could conflict with current game operations.
