  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: SetFollowState
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::SetFollowState(FollowState state)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the follow state of the leader-follower behavior to control movement
    and positioning.
  description: The SetFollowState method updates the current state of a leader-follower
    behavior, determining how the follower should react to the leader's movements.
    This method is typically used in AI systems where creatures or NPCs need to maintain
    a specific relationship with a leader entity. The follow state controls whether
    the follower should move towards the leader, stay in place, or perform other actions
    related to following. It is commonly invoked during combat or quest-related events
    when dynamic positioning becomes necessary.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: The new follow state to set for the behavior. Valid values include
      FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW, FOLLOW_STATE_IDLE, FOLLOW_STATE_RETURN, and others depending
      on implementation. This parameter determines how the follower will behave in
      relation to the leader.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a follower to follow the leader
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = unit->GetAI()->GetLeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pausing follower movement
    code: 'LeaderFollowBehavior* behavior = unit->GetAI()->GetLeaderFollowBehavior();

      behavior->SetFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_IDLE);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system and should only be called on units that
    have a valid LeaderFollowBehavior instance. The behavior state change may trigger
    internal callbacks or events within the AI framework.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the unit has a valid leader-follower
    behavior can result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that GetLeaderFollowBehavior()
    returns a non-null pointer before calling SetFollowState().
