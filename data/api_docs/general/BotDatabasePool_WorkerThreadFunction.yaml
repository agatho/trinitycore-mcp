  signature: void BotDatabasePool::WorkerThreadFunction()
documentation:
  brief: Processes database operations in a dedicated worker thread for bot-related
    data.
  description: The WorkerThreadFunction method serves as the main execution loop for
    a background thread responsible for handling database operations within the BotDatabasePool.
    This function continuously processes queued database tasks, ensuring that bot-related
    data persistence and retrieval does not block the main game thread. It manages
    the lifecycle of database connections, executes SQL statements, and handles result
    processing for various bot management operations such as saving player data, loading
    configurations, or updating bot states. The method operates in a loop until the
    thread is signaled to terminate, making it a critical component for maintaining
    efficient asynchronous database access in the TrinityCore environment.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void example() {\n    // This method is typically called internally by\
      \ the BotDatabasePool\n    // when starting a worker thread, not directly by\
      \ developers.\n    BotDatabasePool* pool = BotDatabasePool::Instance();\n  \
      \  // The worker thread starts automatically upon pool initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to run in a dedicated thread and should never be
    called from the main game thread. It uses thread synchronization primitives to
    safely access shared resources. The function assumes that database connections
    are properly initialized before execution begins.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from application code as it's intended
    for internal use only. Improper usage may lead to race conditions or deadlocks
    in database operations.
