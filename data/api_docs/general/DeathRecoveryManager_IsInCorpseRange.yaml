documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player is within the corpse recovery range.
  description: The IsInCorpseRange method determines whether the player character
    is currently within the valid range to recover their corpse after death. This
    check is typically used in conjunction with death-related mechanics and corpse
    management systems within TrinityCore's game logic. The method evaluates the player's
    current position relative to their last death location and returns true if they
    are within the configurable corpse recovery distance, otherwise false. This functionality
    is crucial for ensuring players can only recover their corpses when they are close
    enough to the death location.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is within the corpse recovery range of their
    last death location; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death handling
    code: "if (player->GetDeathRecoveryManager()->IsInCorpseRange()) {\n    // Player\
      \ can recover their corpse\n    player->RecoverCorpse();\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ is too far from corpse\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You are too far\
      \ from your corpse to recover it.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs distance calculations between the player's current
    position and their last death location. The actual range value is probably configurable
    through server settings or game rules. The implementation may involve spatial
    partitioning or grid-based checks for performance optimization.
