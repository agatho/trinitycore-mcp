  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetElapsedTimeForMovement
  signature: uint32 AreaTrigger::GetElapsedTimeForMovement() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the elapsed time in milliseconds since the area trigger
    started its movement.
  description: The GetElapsedTimeForMovement method computes the amount of time that
    has passed since the area trigger began executing its movement animation or path.
    This is typically used to synchronize visual effects, sounds, or other game events
    with the progress of the area trigger's motion. The returned value represents
    a millisecond timestamp relative to when the movement commenced. This method is
    commonly invoked during the update loop of area triggers to determine how far
    along in their animation sequence they currently are.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of milliseconds that have elapsed
    since the area trigger started its movement. Returns 0 if no movement has been
    initiated or if the area trigger is not currently animating.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void AreaTrigger::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    uint32 elapsed = GetElapsedTimeForMovement();\n\
      \    if (elapsed >= 5000) // 5 seconds\n    {\n        // Trigger event after\
      \ 5 seconds of movement\n        DoSomething();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Elapsed Time for Animation Synchronization
    code: "void AreaTrigger::HandleMovement()\n{\n    uint32 elapsed = GetElapsedTimeForMovement();\n\
      \    float progress = static_cast<float>(elapsed) / 1000.0f; // Convert to seconds\n\
      \    \n    // Adjust visual effect based on movement progress\n    SetVisualEffectIntensity(progress);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal timing mechanism of the area trigger's
    movement state. It assumes that the movement has already been initialized and
    is actively running. The value returned should be treated as a relative time delta
    rather than an absolute timestamp, especially when dealing with multiple concurrent
    area triggers.
  warnings: Do not use this method before calling StartMovement() or if the area trigger
    is in a non-moving state; it may return unexpected values or zero. Also note that
    this function does not account for server lag or time dilation effects, so results
    should be interpreted carefully in time-sensitive scenarios.
