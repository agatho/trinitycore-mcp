documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active loot sessions in the coordination system
  description: The GetActiveLootSessions method retrieves the total number of currently
    active loot coordination sessions within the TrinityCore instance. This count
    represents all ongoing loot distributions where players are actively participating
    in the loot rolling process or waiting for loot to be assigned. The method provides
    a way to monitor the current load on the loot coordination system and can be used
    for debugging, performance monitoring, or administrative purposes. It does not
    modify any state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of active loot sessions currently
    managed by the LootCoordination system. Returns zero if no sessions are active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Active Loot Sessions
    code: "int activeSessions = sLootCoordination->GetActiveLootSessions();\nif (activeSessions\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"loot\", \"Currently %d active loot sessions\",\
      \ activeSessions);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used for monitoring purposes and does not perform
    any locking or thread synchronization internally. It should be safe to call from
    any thread context, though the value may change between when it's called and when
    it's used if other threads are modifying loot sessions.
