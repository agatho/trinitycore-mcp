documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell is classified as dangerous within the
    MechanicAwareness system
  description: The IsDangerousSpell method evaluates whether a given spell ID corresponds
    to a spell that is considered dangerous by the MechanicAwareness system. This
    classification typically involves spells that can cause significant harm, disrupt
    gameplay mechanics, or pose risks to player safety. The method checks against
    an internal database or lookup table of dangerous spells and returns true if the
    spell is found in this list, false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used
    in AI behavior systems, threat assessments, and game state management to make
    decisions based on spell danger levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID is classified as dangerous; otherwise
    returns false. The method does not throw exceptions or return null values.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a spell is dangerous
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->IsDangerousSpell(12345)) {\n    // Handle dangerous\
      \ spell case\n    printf(\"Spell 12345 is dangerous\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in AI decision making for threat assessment
    code: "uint32 currentSpellId = unit->GetCurrentSpell();\nif (mechanicAwareness->IsDangerousSpell(currentSpellId))\
      \ {\n    // AI should avoid engaging or take defensive action\n    ai->SetState(AI_STATE_DEFENSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal lookup table or database of spell IDs
    that are marked as dangerous. The implementation may be optimized for fast lookups,
    possibly using hash tables or binary search structures. Developers should be aware
    that the list of dangerous spells can vary between game versions and expansions.
  warnings: Ensure that spell IDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to
    actual spells in the game database. Invalid spell IDs might not be properly handled
    and could lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues if the internal lookup
    mechanism is not robust.
