  class: MapDb2Entries
  method: IsInstanceIdBound
  signature: bool MapDb2Entries::IsInstanceIdBound() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map entry is bound to a specific instance ID.
  description: The IsInstanceIdBound method checks if the current MapDb2Entries object
    represents a map that is bound to a specific instance ID. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to identify maps that are part of dynamic instances,
    such as raid dungeons or battlegrounds, where each instance has its own unique
    identifier. The method returns true if the map entry is associated with an instance
    ID, indicating that it should not be shared across multiple instances. This functionality
    is crucial for proper instance management and ensures that players are correctly
    placed in their respective instance environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry is bound to a specific instance ID, indicating
    that it represents a dynamic instance. Returns false if the map is not instance-bound
    and can be shared across multiple instances or is a static world map.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Instance Binding for a Map
    code: "MapDb2Entries* mapEntry = sMapDB2Store.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (mapEntry\
      \ && mapEntry->IsInstanceIdBound()) {\n    // This map is instance-bound, likely\
      \ a raid or battleground\n    printf(\"Map %d is bound to an instance ID\\n\"\
      , mapEntry->GetId());\n} else {\n    // This map can be shared across instances\n\
      \    printf(\"Map %d is not instance-bound\\n\", mapEntry->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with instance management systems
    to ensure proper player placement and instance lifecycle handling. The implementation
    likely checks internal flags or data members within the MapDb2Entries structure
    that indicate instance binding status.
