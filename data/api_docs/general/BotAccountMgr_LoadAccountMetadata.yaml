  class: BotAccountMgr
  method: LoadAccountMetadata
  signature: void BotAccountMgr::LoadAccountMetadata()
documentation:
  brief: Loads metadata for all bot accounts from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadAccountMetadata method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with metadata associated with bot accounts stored in the database.
    This includes information such as account identifiers, permissions, settings,
    and other relevant configuration data needed for managing bot behavior within
    the TrinityCore framework. The method is typically invoked during server startup
    or when bot account data needs to be refreshed. It ensures that all bot-related
    functionality has access to up-to-date account metadata without requiring repeated
    database queries.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: BotAccountMgr::instance()->LoadAccountMetadata();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization to avoid redundant
    database reads. The metadata is cached in memory for fast access, so subsequent
    calls will not re-query the database unless explicitly invalidated.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper invalidation may lead
    to inconsistent or duplicated data in memory. Ensure that no active bot sessions
    are running before invoking this method if data consistency is critical.
