  signature: HunterSpec HunterAI::GetCurrentSpecialization() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current specialization of the hunter AI.
  description: The GetCurrentSpecialization method returns the HunterSpec enum value
    representing the current specialization of the hunter AI. This method is used
    to determine which hunter specialization (Beast Mastery, Marksmanship, or Survival)
    is currently active for the AI-controlled hunter. The returned value can be used
    to make decisions about ability selection, strategy, and behavior in different
    combat scenarios. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely
    informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A HunterSpec enum value indicating the current specialization of the hunter
    AI. Possible values are typically BeastMastery, Marksmanship, or Survival depending
    on the implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "HunterSpec spec = ai->GetCurrentSpecialization();\nif (spec == HunterSpec::BeastMastery)\n\
      {\n    // Handle Beast Mastery specific logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Selection Based on Specialization
    code: "HunterSpec spec = ai->GetCurrentSpecialization();\nswitch (spec)\n{\n \
      \   case HunterSpec::BeastMastery:\n        // Use pet abilities and focus on\
      \ control\n        break;\n    case HunterSpec::Marksmanship:\n        // Focus\
      \ on high damage single target attacks\n        break;\n    case HunterSpec::Survival:\n\
      \        // Emphasize survivability and trap usage\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently to ensure up-to-date specialization
    information, especially when the AI's specialization might change during combat.
    The implementation likely caches the specialization value for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI is properly initialized before calling this method,
    as calling it on an uninitialized or invalid AI instance may result in undefined
    behavior. This method should not be used to modify the hunter's specialization
    directly.
