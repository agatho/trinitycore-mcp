  signature: bool BotHealthCheck::IsSystemDeadlocked() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the bot system has encountered a deadlock condition.
  description: The IsSystemDeadlocked method determines whether the bot system has
    entered a deadlock state, which typically occurs when the system is unable to
    make progress due to circular dependencies or resource contention. This check
    is essential for maintaining system stability and preventing infinite waits in
    bot operations. The method performs internal state checks to detect such conditions
    without blocking execution. It is commonly used as part of health monitoring and
    recovery mechanisms within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot system is currently in a deadlock state, indicating
    that progress cannot be made due to resource contention or circular dependencies;
    otherwise returns false if the system is operating normally.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Deadlock Detection
    code: "if (botHealthCheck.IsSystemDeadlocked()) {\n    // Handle deadlock scenario\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Bot system detected deadlock, attempting recovery...\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be non-blocking and should not introduce significant
    performance overhead. It relies on internal synchronization primitives and state
    tracking mechanisms that are part of the TrinityCore bot management system.
