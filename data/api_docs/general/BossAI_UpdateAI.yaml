documentation:
  brief: Updates the boss AI behavior based on elapsed time and combat state
  description: The UpdateAI method is a core component of the BossAI class that handles
    the artificial intelligence logic for boss creatures in TrinityCore. It processes
    combat behaviors, spell casting, target selection, and other AI-driven actions
    based on the time difference (diff) parameter. This method is called regularly
    by the game loop to maintain dynamic boss behavior during encounters. The implementation
    typically includes checks for player proximity, health thresholds, and cooldown
    management for abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: Time elapsed since last update in milliseconds. Used to determine
      when to trigger AI actions, spell casts, or behavior changes based on timing
      requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic BossAI Update Implementation
    code: "void BossAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Process spell casting logic\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Handle AI actions based on time difference\n    if\
      \ (diff >= 1000)\n    {\n        // Execute boss-specific AI behavior\n    \
      \    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is automatically called by the core game engine during each update
    cycle. Developers should ensure that all AI logic within this method executes
    efficiently to avoid performance bottlenecks. The diff parameter represents actual
    game time, not CPU execution time, making it suitable for timing-based behaviors.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from custom AI code as it's managed by
    the core engine. Modifications to AI behavior should be made through override
    methods or event handlers rather than changing the base UpdateAI implementation.
