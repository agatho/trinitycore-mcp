  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadEventScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes all event scripts from the database into memory for
    execution.
  description: The LoadEventScripts method is responsible for retrieving all event
    script entries from the database tables and loading them into internal data structures
    within the ObjectMgr class. This method ensures that all scripted events, such
    as those triggered by game events, creature interactions, or quest completions,
    are properly registered and ready for execution when their conditions are met.
    It typically runs during server startup or when event data is refreshed, parsing
    database records and constructing in-memory representations of event scripts to
    support real-time event handling during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadScriptingData()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadEventScripts();\n\
      \    // Other loading operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server startup or when reloading
    event data. It performs database queries to fetch all relevant event script entries
    and constructs internal lookup structures for efficient event execution. The method
    may involve locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during concurrent access.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method can lead to missing event triggers
    or runtime errors. Ensure that all referenced database tables exist and contain
    valid data before calling this method. Any malformed script entries in the database
    may cause partial loading failures.
