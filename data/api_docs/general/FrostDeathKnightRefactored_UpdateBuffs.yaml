  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void FrostDeathKnightRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost death knight's buffs and aura states based on current game
    conditions and player status.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs, auras, and temporary effects that are applicable to a frost death
    knight class character. This includes checking for buff expiration, applying new
    buffs based on talent trees or equipped items, updating aura durations, and ensuring
    the player's combat state reflects current buff statuses. The method typically
    integrates with the core TrinityCore AI system to maintain proper spell and effect
    management during combat and non-combat scenarios. It may also handle interactions
    between different buffs, such as stacking rules or mutual exclusivity, and ensures
    that the death knight's abilities remain properly enhanced according to their
    current state.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void FrostDeathKnightAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other\
      \ AI logic\n    m_frostDK->UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of update logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle or when significant
    state changes occur, such as entering combat or changing gear. It may perform
    multiple internal checks and could have performance implications if called too
    frequently without proper throttling.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method directly from spell effects unless necessary,
    as it might interfere with the natural spell casting flow and aura management
    system. The method assumes that the death knight object is in a valid state and
    properly initialized.
