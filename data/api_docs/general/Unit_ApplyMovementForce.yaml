documentation:
  brief: Applies a movement force to a unit, affecting its position and velocity
  description: The ApplyMovementForce method is used to apply a force to a Unit object,
    which can influence its movement behavior in the game world. This method allows
    for precise control over how units move, particularly in scenarios involving physics-based
    movement or when dealing with transport mechanisms. The function typically affects
    the unit's velocity and position based on parameters such as magnitude, direction,
    and type of force applied.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the specific force being applied, used to distinguish
      between different forces or effects
  - name: origin
    description: The origin point from which the force is applied, typically representing
      a location in the world space
  - name: magnitude
    description: The strength of the force being applied, determining how much influence
      the force has on movement
  - name: type
    description: Type of force being applied (e.g., 0 = direct, 1 = indirect), affecting
      how the force is processed and applied
  - name: direction
    description: Direction in which the force is applied, typically represented as
      a vector or angle for movement direction
  - name: transportGuid
    description: GUID of the transport object that the unit is attached to, if applicable,
      used to ensure proper positioning relative to transport
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->ApplyMovementForce(12345, 67890, 1.5f, 0, 1, 0);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it can affect unit behavior in complex
    ways; ensure proper handling of transport GUIDs to avoid incorrect positioning.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in unexpected movement behavior
    or positioning errors, especially when dealing with transport objects.
