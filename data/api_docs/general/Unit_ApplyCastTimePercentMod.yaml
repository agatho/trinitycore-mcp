  class: Unit
  method: ApplyCastTimePercentMod
  signature: void Unit::ApplyCastTimePercentMod(float val, bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a percentage modifier to the cast time of spells.
  description: This method modifies the casting time of spells by applying a percentage
    adjustment. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft to alter spell casting duration,
    such as when a character's casting time is reduced or increased due to various
    effects like buffs, debuffs, or abilities. The method operates on the unit's current
    cast time and applies the specified percentage modifier to all applicable spells.
    This functionality is essential for managing game mechanics related to spell casting,
    including cooldowns and timing adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: The percentage value to apply to the cast time. Positive values increase
      cast time, while negative values decrease it. A value of 100 means no change
      in cast time.
  - name: apply
    description: Determines whether to apply or remove the modifier. If true, the
      modifier is applied; if false, it is removed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->ApplyCastTimePercentMod(50.0f, true);

      // This reduces cast time by 50% for all spells on the unit'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->ApplyCastTimePercentMod(-25.0f, false);

      // This removes a 25% reduction from cast time, effectively increasing it by
      25%'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to manage casting time adjustments. It should be called carefully as it affects
    the timing of all spells that are affected by the modifier. The implementation
    involves updating internal spell cast time calculations, and may require synchronization
    if multiple threads are involved.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect spell casting behavior,
    potentially causing game balance issues or unexpected behavior in combat. Care
    should be taken when applying negative values to avoid unintended side effects
    such as increased casting time.
