  method: GetTransportOrientation
  signature: float Vehicle::GetTransportOrientation() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the orientation angle of the vehicle's transport in radians.
  description: The GetTransportOrientation method retrieves the current angular orientation
    of the vehicle's transport component. This value represents the yaw angle (rotation
    around the Z-axis) of the vehicle's movement direction, expressed in radians.
    The returned value is typically used for calculating movement vectors, determining
    facing directions, or synchronizing visual orientation with physics-based movement.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, this method accesses internal
    transport state data that tracks the vehicle's rotational position relative to
    its parent transport object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the transport orientation in radians. This value
    typically ranges from 0.0 to 2*PI (approximately 6.283), where 0.0 represents
    north-facing direction and increases clockwise. The value may wrap around at 2*PI
    or -2*PI depending on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Orientation Check
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    float orientation\
      \ = vehicle->GetTransportOrientation();\n    // Use orientation for movement\
      \ calculations or debugging\n    sLog->outString(\"Vehicle orientation: %f radians\"\
      , orientation);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Orientation to Calculate Movement Direction
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    float orientation\
      \ = vehicle->GetTransportOrientation();\n    float cosO = cosf(orientation);\n\
      \    float sinO = sinf(orientation);\n    // Use cosO and sinO to calculate\
      \ forward movement vector\n    Vector3 direction(cosO, sinO, 0.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called on vehicle objects that are part of a transport
    system. The orientation value reflects the current state of the vehicle's movement
    and may change dynamically during transport operations. Implementation uses internal
    physics calculations and may be affected by transport updates or vehicle state
    changes.
  warnings: The returned value is in radians, not degrees, so be careful when performing
    trigonometric calculations. Also, this method should only be called on valid vehicle
    objects that are currently mounted and have a valid transport component; otherwise
    the behavior may be undefined.
