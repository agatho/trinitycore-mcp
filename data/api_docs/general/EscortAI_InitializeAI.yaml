documentation:
  brief: Initializes the EscortAI behavior for a creature, setting up escort-related
    AI states and configurations.
  description: The InitializeAI method is responsible for setting up the initial state
    and configuration of an EscortAI instance. This method is typically called during
    the creation or activation of a creature that is meant to perform escort quests.
    It initializes internal variables such as waypoint data, escort state flags, and
    NPC behavior settings required for proper escort functionality. The method ensures
    that the creature's AI is ready to handle escort-related events like starting
    the escort, managing waypoints, and responding to player interactions during the
    quest. This initialization process is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior
    across different escort scenarios in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.

  - title: Basic EscortAI Initialization
    code: "class MyEscortNPC : public Creature\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeAI()\
      \ override\n    {\n        EscortAI::InitializeAI();\n        // Additional\
      \ custom initialization can follow\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the creature's lifecycle, typically
    during its creation or when it becomes active as an escort target. It is important
    to ensure that all required waypoint data is loaded before calling this method
    to avoid runtime errors. The method does not perform any complex AI calculations
    but rather sets up the necessary state for subsequent AI operations.
  warnings: Calling InitializeAI multiple times on the same instance may lead to undefined
    behavior or corrupted internal state. Ensure that no other AI initialization routines
    are called after this method unless explicitly documented as safe. This method
    should never be called on creatures that are not intended to serve as escort targets.
