  method: TargetIconChangedHandler
  signature: void TargetIconChangedHandler::TargetIconChangedHandler(BotAI * botAI)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a TargetIconChangedHandler instance with the provided BotAI context.
  description: The TargetIconChangedHandler constructor initializes the handler with
    a BotAI object, which is essential for managing target icon changes within the
    AI framework. This handler likely monitors or responds to changes in target icons
    (such as those displayed on the minimap or in the player's interface) that may
    affect bot behavior or decision-making. The BotAI parameter provides access to
    the AI context and associated data structures needed for processing these events.
  parameters:
  - name: botAI
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that this handler will use to access
      AI-related functionality and state information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of TargetIconChangedHandler
    code: TargetIconChangedHandler handler(botAI);
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or setup beyond
    storing the provided BotAI pointer. It is expected that additional methods will
    be called to register or activate the handler for specific events.
