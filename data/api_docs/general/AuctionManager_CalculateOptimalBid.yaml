  class: AuctionManager
  method: CalculateOptimalBid
  signature: uint64 AuctionManager::CalculateOptimalBid(uint32 itemId, uint64 currentBid,
    uint64 buyoutPrice)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal bid amount for an auction item based on current bid
    and buyout price.
  description: The CalculateOptimalBid method determines the most strategic bid value
    a player should place on an auction item. It considers the current bid amount
    and the item's buyout price to compute a bid that maximizes the chances of winning
    while minimizing overpaying. This method is typically used by the Auction House
    system to suggest competitive bids to players. The calculation logic may take
    into account factors such as bid increments, market dynamics, and auction house
    rules. The method assumes valid input parameters and does not perform explicit
    validation.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction item being bid on. Must correspond
      to a valid item in the game database.
  - name: currentBid
    description: The current highest bid amount for the auction item. Should be a
      positive value representing copper coins.
  - name: buyoutPrice
    description: The buyout price of the auction item. Must be greater than or equal
      to the current bid amount.
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the calculated optimal bid amount in
    copper coins. The returned value is always greater than the current bid and follows
    standard auction house bidding rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint64 optimalBid = auctionManager->CalculateOptimalBid(12345, 100000, 500000);
      // Item ID 12345, current bid 10g, buyout 50g
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House Logic
    code: "uint64 CalculateBidForPlayer(uint32 itemId, uint64 currentBid, uint64 buyoutPrice)\n\
      {\n    AuctionManager* auctionMgr = sAuctionMgr;\n    return auctionMgr->CalculateOptimalBid(itemId,\
      \ currentBid, buyoutPrice);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of the core auction house logic and may be used
    internally by the server when processing bids or suggesting values to players.
    The exact algorithm for calculating the optimal bid is not specified in the public
    API but typically involves incrementing the current bid by a minimum amount (usually
    1% of the buyout price or fixed increments) to remain competitive.
  warnings: Ensure that the currentBid parameter does not exceed the buyoutPrice,
    as this could lead to invalid bidding scenarios. The method assumes valid inputs
    and does not perform error checking on parameter values.
