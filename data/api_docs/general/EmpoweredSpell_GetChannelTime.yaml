  class: EmpoweredSpell
  method: GetChannelTime
  signature: int EmpoweredSpell::GetChannelTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the channel time duration of an empowered spell in milliseconds.
  description: The GetChannelTime method returns the total duration, in milliseconds,
    that a player must channel an empowered spell. This value is typically used to
    determine how long a spell effect persists while the caster maintains focus on
    the spell. The returned value represents the base channel time as defined by the
    spell's properties within the TrinityCore database. This method does not account
    for any modifiers or buffs that may affect channel time during gameplay, and it
    returns the raw configured value from the spell definition.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the channel time duration in milliseconds. A return
    value of zero indicates either no channeling is required or the spell data has
    not been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int channelTime = empoweredSpell->GetChannelTime();\nif (channelTime >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Use channelTime to determine how long the spell will channel\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Spell channels for \" << channelTime << \" milliseconds\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void HandleEmpoweredSpellCast(Player* player, EmpoweredSpell* spell)\n\
      {\n    int channelTime = spell->GetChannelTime();\n    if (channelTime > 0)\n\
      \    {\n        // Start a channeling timer based on the returned value\n  \
      \      player->SetChannelSpell(spell);\n        player->SetChannelTime(channelTime);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses spell data directly from the database configuration
    and should be used carefully in performance-critical sections. The returned value
    is static and does not change during runtime unless the spell definition itself
    is modified.
  warnings: Ensure that the EmpoweredSpell object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as accessing an uninitialized or invalid object may lead to undefined
    behavior. This method returns zero for spells that do not have a defined channel
    time in the database.
