  brief: Initializes and loads quest strategies for bot AI behavior.
  description: The LoadQuestStrategies method is responsible for initializing and
    loading all available quest strategies that define how bot AIs should approach
    and complete quests. This method typically reads configuration data or strategy
    definitions from internal databases or configuration files, setting up the necessary
    data structures for bot quest handling. It ensures that bots have appropriate
    strategies for different quest types, such as quest acceptance, objective completion,
    and quest hand-in behaviors. The method is usually called during the initialization
    phase of bot AI systems to prepare them for quest-related activities.

  notes: This method is typically invoked during the startup or initialization sequence
    of bot AI systems. It may involve reading from configuration files or database
    tables that store quest strategy definitions. The method should be called before
    any bot attempts to engage with quests to ensure proper strategy loading.
