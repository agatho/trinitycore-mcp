documentation:
  brief: Handles a client request to query the current countdown timer status.
  description: The HandleQueryCountdownTimer method processes incoming client requests
    to retrieve information about active countdown timers in the game world. This
    typically occurs when players interact with time-sensitive events, such as arena
    matches, battlegrounds, or other timed activities. The method validates the request
    and sends back a response packet containing the current timer state, including
    remaining time and associated event identifiers. It is part of the general session
    handling functionality within TrinityCore's WorldSession class.

  - title: Basic usage in session handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueryCountdownTimer(WorldPackets::Misc::QueryCountdownTimer&\
      \ queryCountdownTimer)\n{\n    // Process the countdown timer query\n    SendPacket(queryCountdownTimer);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during gameplay when a player's client requests
    current time-sensitive event information. It should be handled efficiently to
    avoid performance bottlenecks in high-traffic scenarios.
