  class: ArenaAI
  method: IsTeamWinning
  signature: bool ArenaAI::IsTeamWinning(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player's team is currently winning in an arena match.
  description: The IsTeamWinning method evaluates the current state of an arena battle
    to determine if the player's team holds a winning advantage. This method is typically
    used by AI logic within the TrinityCore framework to make strategic decisions
    during arena combat, such as when to switch tactics or when to engage in aggressive
    play. The method considers various factors including health percentages, damage
    dealt, and overall team performance metrics to assess the likelihood of victory
    for the player's faction. It returns a boolean value indicating the outcome of
    this assessment.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be set to the player's GUID if the
      method determines the team is winning. This parameter allows the calling code
      to identify which specific player's team status is being evaluated.
  returns: Returns true if the player's team is currently winning in the arena match,
    false otherwise. When returning true, the player parameter is updated with the
    GUID of the relevant player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check team status
    code: "int playerId = 0;\nbool isWinning = ai->IsTeamWinning(&playerId);\nif (isWinning)\n\
      {\n    // Player's team is winning, adjust strategy\n    printf(\"Team is winning,\
      \ player ID: %d\\n\", playerId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player's team is losing\
      \ or tied\n    printf(\"Team is not winning\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result for tactical decision making
    code: "int playerGuid = 0;\nif (ai->IsTeamWinning(&playerGuid))\n{\n    // Increase\
      \ aggression, focus on finishing off opponents\n    ai->SetAggression(AggressionLevel::HIGH);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Defend more aggressively, preserve health\n    ai->SetAggression(AggressionLevel::LOW);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal arena state tracking and may not reflect real-time
    changes immediately. It should be called periodically during arena combat to maintain
    accurate team status awareness. The player parameter is only updated when the
    method returns true, otherwise its value remains unchanged.
  warnings: The method assumes that the ArenaAI instance has been properly initialized
    with valid arena data. Calling this method outside of an active arena match may
    produce unpredictable results or cause undefined behavior. Ensure proper synchronization
    if accessed from multiple threads.
