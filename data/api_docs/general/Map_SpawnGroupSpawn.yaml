  class: Map
  method: SpawnGroupSpawn
  signature: bool Map::SpawnGroupSpawn(uint32 groupId, bool ignoreRespawn, bool force,
    int * spawnedObjects)
documentation:
  brief: Spawns all objects in a specified spawn group within the map.
  description: The SpawnGroupSpawn method is responsible for spawning all game objects
    that belong to a specific spawn group within the current map. This method handles
    the activation of objects based on their spawn group ID, which is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage object spawning and despawning.
    It allows for control over whether respawn behavior should be ignored and provides
    flexibility in forcing object spawning regardless of their current state. The
    method returns true if all objects in the group were successfully spawned, false
    otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: The unique identifier of the spawn group to be spawned. This ID corresponds
      to a specific set of game objects that are managed by the spawn system.
  - name: ignoreRespawn
    description: When set to true, ignores the normal respawn behavior of objects,
      allowing them to spawn even if they would normally be despawned due to respawn
      conditions.
  - name: force
    description: If true, forces all objects in the group to spawn regardless of their
      current state or whether they are already spawned. This parameter is useful
      for ensuring complete control over object spawning.
  - name: spawnedObjects
    description: Pointer to an integer that will be updated with the number of objects
      successfully spawned. If null, this value is ignored.
  returns: Returns true if all objects in the spawn group were successfully spawned;
    otherwise false. This indicates whether the spawning operation completed without
    error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spawn Group Usage
    code: "Map* map = GetMap();\nbool result = map->SpawnGroupSpawn(12345, false,\
      \ true, nullptr);\nif (result)\n{\n    // All objects in group 12345 were spawned\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Tracking Spawned Objects
    code: "Map* map = GetMap();\nint spawnedCount = 0;\nbool result = map->SpawnGroupSpawn(12345,\
      \ true, false, &spawnedCount);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Process spawnedCount\
      \ to understand how many objects were spawned\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spawn group management
    systems and may be called during map initialization or when specific game events
    occur. It's important to note that this method does not handle the spawning of
    creatures, only game objects. Performance considerations include checking if the
    spawn group exists before calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where you're trying to spawn
    a group that doesn't exist or is not properly defined. Also, be cautious when
    using force=true as it may lead to unexpected behavior if objects are already
    spawned and the system tries to re-spawn them.
