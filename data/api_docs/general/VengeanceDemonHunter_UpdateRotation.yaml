  class: VengeanceDemonHunter
  method: UpdateRotation
  signature: void VengeanceDemonHunter::UpdateRotation(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Vengeance Demon Hunter's rotation based on the current target.
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the appropriate combat rotation for a Vengeance Demon Hunter AI. This method evaluates
    the current target, available abilities, resource levels, and combat state to
    decide which spells or actions should be performed next in the rotation sequence.
    It typically integrates with the AI system to make real-time tactical decisions
    during combat encounters. The method is called regularly by the AI framework as
    part of the demon hunter's behavior update cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current target. This
      parameter defines the enemy the Vengeance Demon Hunter will focus on during
      rotation execution. Must be a valid Unit pointer; null pointers may cause undefined
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Update rotation with current target\n    _vengeanceDemonHunter->UpdateRotation(mVictim);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void VengeanceDemonHunter::UpdateRotation(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || !target->IsAlive())\n        return;\n\n    // Check if we have valid resources\
      \ and abilities\n    if (HasEnoughResources() && CanCastNextAbility())\n   \
      \ {\n        ExecuteRotationSequence(target);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n    \
      \    // Handle resource management or defensive actions\n        HandleDefensiveActions(target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should not block
    execution for extended periods. It's recommended to keep the logic lightweight
    and avoid heavy computations within this function. The method assumes that the
    target is valid and alive before attempting any rotation decisions.
  warnings: Passing a null or invalid Unit pointer to this method can result in crashes
    or undefined behavior. Always validate the target parameter before calling UpdateRotation.
    Additionally, ensure that the AI framework properly manages the timing of calls
    to prevent excessive CPU usage during combat.
