  class: TerrainMgr
  method: InitializeParentMapData
  signature: void TerrainMgr::InitializeParentMapData(const int & mapData)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes parent map data for terrain management within the World of Warcraft
    server environment.
  description: The InitializeParentMapData method sets up essential data structures
    and configurations required for managing terrain information across different
    maps in TrinityCore. This method is typically invoked during server startup or
    map loading processes to ensure that all necessary terrain-related resources are
    properly initialized before gameplay begins. It prepares internal data caches
    and establishes connections to map-specific terrain databases, enabling efficient
    retrieval and processing of elevation, heightmap, and other geographic data required
    for player movement, collision detection, and environmental rendering.
  parameters:
  - name: mapData
    description: Reference to an integer representing the map identifier or data handle
      used to initialize parent map data structures. This parameter specifies which
      map's terrain data should be initialized within the terrain manager system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'TerrainMgr* terrainManager = TerrainMgr::Instance();

      int mapId = 0; // Eastern Kingdoms

      terrainManager->InitializeParentMapData(mapId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::LoadTerrainData()\n{\n    TerrainMgr* terrainMgr = TerrainMgr::Instance();\n\
      \    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_MAPS; ++i)\n    {\n        if (Map::IsValidMapId(i))\n\
      \        {\n            terrainMgr->InitializeParentMapData(i);\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the terrain manager instance has
    been properly constructed and initialized. The method performs no validation on
    the input parameter, so callers must ensure that the map data reference points
    to a valid map identifier. It is recommended to call this method during server
    initialization phase before any player interactions occur.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized mapData reference
    may result in undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure all required dependencies
    are loaded prior to invoking this function, as it may rely on other subsystems
    like database connections or file I/O operations.
