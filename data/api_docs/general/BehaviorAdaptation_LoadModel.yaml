  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: LoadModel
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::LoadModel(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Loads a model for a bot using its GUID and a specified filename.
  description: The LoadModel method initializes or updates the visual model of a bot
    within the TrinityCore environment. It takes the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    bot and a filename pointing to the model resource, allowing the system to associate
    the appropriate 3D model with the bot entity. This functionality is typically
    used in AI-driven bot systems where visual representation needs to be dynamically
    assigned or changed based on game context or configuration. The method does not
    return any value but modifies internal state related to the bot's appearance.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose model is to be loaded.
      This value must correspond to a valid existing bot in the game world.
  - name: filename
    description: A string specifying the path or name of the model file to load. The
      filename should point to a valid resource within the game's model directory
      structure.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of LoadModel
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation behavior;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      std::string modelFile = "npc/bot_model.m2";

      behavior.LoadModel(botGuid, modelFile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the game's model loading subsystem and
    may trigger asynchronous resource loading. Ensure that the provided filename is
    valid and accessible to avoid runtime errors or missing models.
