  signature: GroupRole GroupCoordinator::GetBestRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable role for the group coordinator based
    on current group composition and requirements.
  description: The GetBestRole method evaluates the current state of the group coordinator,
    including member roles, class distributions, and group objectives, to determine
    the optimal role assignment. This method is typically used during group formation
    or reorganization to ensure balanced team composition. The returned GroupRole
    represents the role that best fits the current group dynamics and mission requirements.
    The method does not modify any internal state but rather computes and returns
    a recommended role based on heuristics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupRole enum value indicating the most appropriate role for the group
    coordinator. Possible values include LEADER, TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, or NONE if
    no suitable role can be determined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupRole role = groupCoordinator.GetBestRole();\nif (role != GroupRole::NONE)\n\
      {\n    // Assign the recommended role to a player\n    std::cout << \"Recommended\
      \ role: \" << static_cast<int>(role) << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on group composition and may be called
    frequently during group management operations. It's recommended to cache the result
    if the group state hasn't changed between multiple calls.
