  brief: Initializes a new BotLifecycleManager instance as a copy of an existing one
  description: The BotLifecycleManager constructor is responsible for creating a new
    instance of the BotLifecycleManager class by copying the state and configuration
    from an existing BotLifecycleManager object. This copy constructor ensures that
    all internal data members, including bot management settings, lifecycle states,
    and associated configurations, are properly duplicated to maintain consistency
    across multiple instances. In the context of TrinityCore's bot system, this method
    facilitates the creation of bot managers with identical properties, which is essential
    for maintaining uniform behavior when managing multiple bot instances or when
    duplicating existing bot configurations.

  - title: Copying an Existing BotLifecycleManager
    code: 'BotLifecycleManager originalManager;

      // Configure originalManager...

      BotLifecycleManager newManager(originalManager); // Copy constructor usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a copy constructor, so it performs a shallow copy of the internal
    state. Any pointers or references within the BotLifecycleManager should be handled
    carefully to avoid dangling references or unexpected behavior when modifying the
    copied instance.
