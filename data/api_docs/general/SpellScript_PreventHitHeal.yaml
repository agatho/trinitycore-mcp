documentation:
  brief: Prevents the spell from healing the target.
  description: The PreventHitHeal method is used within SpellScript implementations
    to block a healing effect from being applied to the target. When called, it ensures
    that any healing portion of the spell will not be executed, effectively nullifying
    the heal. This method is typically invoked during the spell's hit phase, usually
    within a custom spell script handler such as AfterHit or OnHit. It is commonly
    used in scenarios where a spell should have a healing component but needs to be
    prevented from actually healing under certain conditions, such as when the target
    is immune to healing effects or when the heal should only occur if specific criteria
    are met.

    code: "class MyHealSpellScript : public SpellScript\n{\npublic:\n    void HandleAfterHit()\
      \ override\n    {\n        if (GetHitTarget()->HasAura(12345)) // If target\
      \ has a specific aura\n            PreventHitHeal(); // Prevent the heal from\
      \ applying\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects healing effects that are part of the spell's hit
    calculation. It does not prevent damage or other effects. The method should be
    called before any healing is applied to ensure it takes effect.
  warnings: Calling PreventHitHeal() after healing has already occurred will have
    no effect. Ensure this method is used in an appropriate phase of the spell lifecycle,
    such as during AfterHit or OnHit handlers.
