  signature: void CombatStateAnalyzer::UpdateGroupMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates group combat metrics for all players in the current group
  description: The UpdateGroupMetrics method calculates and updates various combat-related
    statistics for all members of the player's group. This includes tracking damage
    dealt, healing done, time spent in combat, and other relevant metrics that contribute
    to group performance analysis. The method is typically invoked during combat events
    or at regular intervals to maintain up-to-date group combat data. It ensures that
    group-based combat analytics remain current and accurate for reporting and performance
    evaluation purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerEnterCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    CombatStateAnalyzer::UpdateGroupMetrics();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Periodic Group Metrics Update
    code: "void UpdateGroupCombatStats()\n{\n    // Called every 5 seconds during\
      \ active combat\n    CombatStateAnalyzer::UpdateGroupMetrics();\n}\n\n// In\
      \ a periodic update loop\nvoid PeriodicUpdate()\n{\n    if (IsInCombat())\n\
      \        UpdateGroupCombatStats();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a group context.
    The implementation may involve iterating through all group members and updating
    their individual combat state, which could have performance implications during
    high-frequency combat events. Consider calling this method less frequently during
    intense combat situations to avoid performance degradation.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a valid group context may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect metrics. Ensure that the player is actually part of a group
    before invoking this method. The method assumes all group members are properly
    initialized and available for metric calculation.
