documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LanguageMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the LanguageMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the language management system exists
    throughout the TrinityCore server runtime. This method provides global access
    to the language configuration and translation services used by the game. The returned
    pointer is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the server's operation and
    should not be deleted by callers. This method is thread-safe and can be called
    from any context within the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of LanguageMgr. The return value is
    never null during normal server operation, as the singleton is initialized during
    server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Language Manager for Translation
    code: 'LanguageMgr* langMgr = LanguageMgr::instance();

      std::string translatedText = langMgr->GetLocalizedStringById(12345);

      // Use translatedText in player communication'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Language Configuration
    code: 'LanguageMgr* langMgr = LanguageMgr::instance();

      uint32 defaultLanguage = langMgr->GetDefaultLanguage();

      bool isLanguageSupported = langMgr->IsLanguageSupported(LANG_ENGLISH);

      // Configure game behavior based on language settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: The LanguageMgr singleton is initialized during server startup and destroyed
    at shutdown. This method should not be used to create new instances of LanguageMgr,
    as doing so would violate the singleton pattern. The implementation uses a static
    local variable for thread-safe lazy initialization.
  warnings: Do not attempt to delete or manage the returned pointer manually, as it
    is owned by the singleton system. Calling this method from within a destructor
    or during server shutdown may result in undefined behavior if the singleton has
    already been destroyed.
