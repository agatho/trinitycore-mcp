  signature: bool GridMap::loadHolesData(FILE * in, uint32 offset, uint32 size)
documentation:
  brief: Loads hole data from a file into the grid map for collision detection.
  description: The loadHolesData method reads hole information from a specified file
    stream and populates the grid map's internal data structures with collision hole
    definitions. This functionality is crucial for accurately representing areas where
    players or creatures cannot walk, such as gaps in the terrain or voids. The method
    requires a valid file handle, offset, and size parameters to correctly parse the
    binary data containing hole coordinates and dimensions. It typically executes
    during map loading phases when terrain data is being initialized.
  parameters:
  - name: in
    description: Pointer to an open FILE object from which the hole data will be read.
      Must be a valid file handle opened in binary mode.
  - name: offset
    description: Byte offset within the file where the hole data begins. Specifies
      the starting position for reading hole information.
  - name: size
    description: Number of bytes to read from the file starting at the specified offset.
      Defines the total size of the hole data section.
  returns: Returns true if the hole data was successfully loaded and parsed; false
    otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid file handle, incorrect data format,
    or insufficient data in the file.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of loadHolesData
    code: "FILE* file = fopen(\"map0_holes.bin\", \"rb\");\nif (file != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    GridMap* map = new GridMap();\n    bool success = map->loadHolesData(file,\
      \ 0, 1024);\n    fclose(file);\n    if (!success)\n        printf(\"Failed to\
      \ load hole data\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Loading holes with error handling
    code: "FILE* file = fopen(\"map0_holes.bin\", \"rb\");\nif (file != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    GridMap* map = new GridMap();\n    uint32 offset = 100;\n    uint32 size\
      \ = 2048;\n    if (!map->loadHolesData(file, offset, size))\n    {\n       \
      \ fprintf(stderr, \"Error loading hole data at offset %u\\n\", offset);\n  \
      \      fclose(file);\n        delete map;\n        return false;\n    }\n  \
      \  fclose(file);\n    // Proceed with further initialization\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the grid map initialization process.
    The hole data format is expected to be a binary structure containing coordinate
    information and dimensions for each collision hole. The method assumes that the
    file pointer is positioned correctly at the start of the hole data section before
    calling.
  warnings: Ensure that the FILE* parameter points to a valid, open file with appropriate
    permissions. Passing an invalid or closed file handle will result in undefined
    behavior. Also, the offset and size parameters must accurately reflect the actual
    location and length of the hole data within the file.
