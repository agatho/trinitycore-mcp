  signature: bool BotScheduler::IsPeakHour(uint32 hour) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified hour falls within peak gameplay hours.
  description: The IsPeakHour method evaluates whether a given hour of the day is
    considered a peak hour for player activity in World of Warcraft. This functionality
    is typically used by bot scheduling systems to optimize when automated players
    perform actions, aligning with times when real players are most active. The method
    likely uses predefined time ranges or configurable settings to determine peak
    periods, which may vary based on server type, region, or game events. It returns
    true if the hour falls within these defined peak periods, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified hour is considered a peak hour for player
    activity; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if current hour is a peak hour
    code: "uint32 currentHour = time(nullptr) % 24;\nif (botScheduler.IsPeakHour(currentHour))\
      \ {\n    // Schedule intensive bot activities\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Current\
      \ hour is a peak hour. Starting optimized bot behavior.\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Perform standard bot operations\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Current hour is not\
      \ a peak hour. Proceeding with normal bot behavior.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on configurable settings or hardcoded time ranges
    that define what constitutes 'peak hours'. It may be used in conjunction with
    other scheduling logic to dynamically adjust bot behavior based on server activity
    patterns. The implementation might cache results or use a lookup table for performance
    optimization.
  warnings: Ensure that the hour parameter is within valid range (0-23). While the
    method signature suggests it takes a uint32, invalid values could lead to unexpected
    behavior if not properly validated by the calling code.
