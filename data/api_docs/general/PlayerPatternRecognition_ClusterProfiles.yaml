documentation:
  brief: Clusters player behavior profiles to identify patterns and group similar
    play styles.
  description: The ClusterProfiles method analyzes collected player data to group
    players with similar behavioral characteristics into distinct clusters. This functionality
    is typically used for player segmentation, game balance analysis, or personalized
    content delivery. The method processes various metrics such as movement patterns,
    interaction frequency, and gameplay choices to determine cluster assignments.
    It operates on pre-collected profile data that must be available in the PlayerPatternRecognition
    instance before calling this method.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Profile Clustering
    code: 'PlayerPatternRecognition recognizer;

      // Assume profiles are already loaded into recognizer

      recognizer.ClusterProfiles();

      // Profiles are now clustered based on behavioral similarities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that player profile data has been previously populated
    and validated. The clustering algorithm may use k-means or similar techniques
    internally to group players. Performance can be affected by the number of profiles
    being processed, with larger datasets taking longer to cluster.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior population of player profiles will result
    in empty or invalid clustering results. Ensure all necessary data is loaded before
    invoking ClusterProfiles to avoid unexpected behavior.
