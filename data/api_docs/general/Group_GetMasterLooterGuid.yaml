  class: Group
  method: GetMasterLooterGuid
  signature: int Group::GetMasterLooterGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player designated as the master
    looter for the group.
  description: The GetMasterLooterGuid method retrieves the GUID of the player who
    is currently set as the master looter for the group. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    groups (raids or parties) can have a designated master looter responsible for
    distributing loot according to group rules. This method allows code to query which
    player holds this role. The returned value represents a unique identifier used
    internally by the game engine to track players and their associated data. It is
    important to note that if no master looter has been assigned, or if the master
    looter has left the group, the method may return an invalid or default GUID value.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the master looter player. If no valid
    master looter exists in the group, this value will typically be zero or a special
    invalid GUID constant.
  examples:
  - title: Check Master Looter GUID
    code: "void CheckMasterLooter(Group* group)\n{\n    uint64 mlGuid = group->GetMasterLooterGuid();\n\
      \    if (mlGuid != 0)\n    {\n        // Master looter is set\n        Player*\
      \ mlPlayer = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(mlGuid);\n        if (mlPlayer)\n  \
      \      {\n            // Use the master looter player object\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Master looter: %s\", mlPlayer->GetName().c_str());\n        }\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        // No master looter set\n        sLog->outString(\"No master\
      \ looter assigned.\");\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is commonly used in loot-related systems to determine the authority
    of a player to distribute items. The GUID returned should be validated before
    use, as it may not always correspond to an active player if the master looter
    has left the group or been removed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity.
    If the group's master looter has disconnected or left the group, the GUID might
    be invalid and attempting to access the player object could cause issues.
