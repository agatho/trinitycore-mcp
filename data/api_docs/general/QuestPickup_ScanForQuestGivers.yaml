  method: ScanForQuestGivers
  signature: int QuestPickup::ScanForQuestGivers(Player * bot, float scanRadius)
documentation:
  brief: Scans for quest givers within a specified radius around the player.
  description: The ScanForQuestGivers method searches for all valid quest givers (such
    as NPCs or objects) located within the given scan radius of the provided player
    character. It evaluates the proximity and validity of potential quest givers to
    determine how many are available for interaction. This method is typically used
    in AI-driven questing systems or automated quest pickup logic where the bot needs
    to identify nearby quest givers without manually checking each one. The scan considers
    only those quest givers that are within the specified range and are currently
    active for quest assignment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character performing
      the scan.
  - name: scanRadius
    description: Floating point value indicating the maximum distance (in yards) to
      search for quest givers around the player.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of valid quest givers found
    within the specified scan radius. A return value of zero indicates no eligible
    quest givers were located.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby quest givers
    code: int count = questPickup->ScanForQuestGivers(player, 20.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using result to decide next action in questing AI
    code: "int givers = questPickup->ScanForQuestGivers(bot, 30.0f);\nif (givers >\
      \ 0) {\n    // Proceed with quest pickup logic\n} else {\n    // Move to a new\
      \ location or wait\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query using the game's internal object manager
    and collision detection system. It may have performance implications when scanning
    large areas or with many active quest givers nearby. The scan radius is typically
    limited by server-side configurations and client-side rendering distances.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed into this method is valid and not
    null, otherwise undefined behavior will occur. Also, be cautious of using very
    large scan radii as it may cause performance degradation or unexpected results
    due to server limitations on object queries.
