  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: SwitchTarget
  signature: bool TargetAssistAction::SwitchTarget(Player * bot, Unit * newTarget)
documentation:
  brief: Switches the target of a bot player to a new unit target.
  description: The SwitchTarget method is used in TrinityCore's AI system to change
    the current target of a bot player to a specified unit. This method is typically
    invoked by AI actions that need to redirect the bot's attention or combat focus.
    It handles the necessary internal state updates and ensures that the bot's targeting
    behavior aligns with the new target. The method performs validation checks on
    the provided target to ensure it is valid and eligible for targeting before making
    the switch.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose target will
      be switched.
  - name: newTarget
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will become the new target of the
      bot. Must be a valid unit or nullptr.
  returns: Returns true if the target switch was successful, false otherwise. The
    method may return false if the new target is invalid, unreachable, or if the bot's
    current state prevents the target change.
  examples:
  - title: Basic target switching example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Get bot player\nUnit* newTarget = ...; // Get new\
      \ target unit\nif (TargetAssistAction::SwitchTarget(bot, newTarget)) {\n   \
      \ // Target successfully switched\n    bot->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY,\
      \ LANG_UNIVERSAL, \"Target changed!\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to switch target\n\
      \    bot->SendChatMessage(CHAT_MSG_MONSTER_SAY, LANG_UNIVERSAL, \"Failed to\
      \ change target.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI framework and should only be called from within
    AI logic. It assumes that the bot has a valid AI context and that the new target
    is accessible. The method may internally trigger events or callbacks related to
    target changes.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'newTarget' parameter is not null and represents a valid
    unit before calling this method. Passing an invalid or destroyed unit pointer
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
