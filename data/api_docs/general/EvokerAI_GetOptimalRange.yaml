  class: EvokerAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float EvokerAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the evoker AI based on
    current target.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which an
    evoker AI unit should engage its target for maximum effectiveness. This calculation
    takes into account various factors such as the evoker's spell range capabilities,
    target movement patterns, and combat positioning. The method is typically used
    by the AI system to decide when to cast spells or move closer to a target. It
    returns a float value representing the distance in yards. The method may internally
    reference the current target stored within the AI instance and adjust its calculation
    based on target type and status.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal attack range in yards. This value
    indicates the recommended distance from the evoker to its target for effective
    combat engagement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "float optimalRange = evokerAI->GetOptimalRange();\nif (evokerAI->GetDistanceToTarget()\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    evokerAI->Move closer to target;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches or recalculates the optimal range each time it's
    called, making it suitable for dynamic combat situations where target positioning
    changes frequently. The implementation may consider spell range limitations and
    evoker abilities when determining the return value.
