  method: SetPrivateObjectOwner
  signature: void WorldObject::SetPrivateObjectOwner(const ObjectGuid & owner)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the private object owner GUID for a WorldObject instance.
  description: The SetPrivateObjectOwner method assigns a unique identifier (GUID)
    to define the owner of a private object within the WorldObject hierarchy. This
    is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage ownership
    of game entities such as pets, vehicles, or other controlled objects. The method
    directly modifies an internal member variable that tracks the object's owner.
    It does not perform any validation on the provided GUID and assumes it represents
    a valid ObjectGuid. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper ownership
    relationships in the game world, particularly for player-controlled entities.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: The ObjectGuid representing the new owner of this WorldObject. Must
      be a valid GUID that identifies a game entity such as a player or creature.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Owner for a Pet
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Creature* pet = ...;

      pet->SetPrivateObjectOwner(player->GetGUID());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning Vehicle Owner
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      Vehicle* vehicle = ...;

      vehicle->SetPrivateObjectOwner(player->GetGUID());

      // This ensures the vehicle is properly associated with the player''s control'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal state variable and should be used
    carefully. It is typically called during object creation or ownership transfer
    events. The GUID passed must represent a valid entity in the game world, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or uninitialized ObjectGuid values
    as it may lead to crashes or incorrect ownership tracking. Ensure that the owner
    GUID refers to an existing entity before calling this method.
