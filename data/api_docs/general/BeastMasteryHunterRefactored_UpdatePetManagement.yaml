documentation:
  brief: Updates the management state of the hunter's beast pet based on current game
    conditions and player actions.
  description: The UpdatePetManagement method is responsible for maintaining the active
    state and behavior of a hunter's beast pet within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method evaluates various factors such as pet health, mana levels, target status,
    and player commands to determine appropriate pet actions. It ensures that the
    pet responds correctly to combat situations, follows the hunter during movement,
    and maintains proper positioning relative to the player. The method also handles
    pet summoning, dismissing, and reassignment of control based on the hunter's current
    abilities and the game state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    m_hunter->UpdatePetManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked manually unless implementing custom pet behavior. The method relies
    on internal state tracking of the hunter's pet, so it must be called after any
    changes to pet status or player commands have been processed.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the proper AI update context may result
    in inconsistent pet behavior or unexpected game state. Avoid calling this method
    during combat initialization or when pet states are being modified by other systems
    simultaneously.
