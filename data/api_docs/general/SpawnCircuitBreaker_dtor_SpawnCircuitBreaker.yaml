documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SpawnCircuitBreaker instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SpawnCircuitBreaker class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance.
    This method is automatically invoked when a SpawnCircuitBreaker object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's world management
    system, this may involve unregistering the circuit breaker from internal tracking
    systems, releasing references to spawned entities, or resetting any state that
    was managed during the object's lifetime. The destructor ensures proper resource
    deallocation and prevents memory leaks.

    code: 'SpawnCircuitBreaker* breaker = new SpawnCircuitBreaker();

      // ... use the breaker ...

      delete breaker; // Triggers ~SpawnCircuitBreaker()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object's scope
    ends or is explicitly deleted. It is important to ensure that no other objects
    hold references to this instance after deletion to avoid dangling pointer issues.
