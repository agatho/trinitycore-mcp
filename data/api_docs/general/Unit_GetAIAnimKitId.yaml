  class: Unit
  method: GetAIAnimKitId
  signature: uint16 Unit::GetAIAnimKitId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the AI animation kit ID associated with the unit.
  description: The GetAIAnimKitId method retrieves the animation kit identifier that
    is used by the unit's AI system to determine which animations should be played
    during various AI states. This value is typically set during the unit's initialization
    and can be used to identify specific animation behaviors for creatures or NPCs
    within the game world. The method returns a uint16 value representing the animation
    kit ID, which is essential for proper AI behavior implementation in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents a uint16 identifier that corresponds to an
    animation kit used by the unit's AI system. This value typically maps to specific
    animation sequences or behaviors within the game mechanics and can be used to
    determine how the unit should animate during different AI states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 animKitId = unit->GetAIAnimKitId();\nif (animKitId != 0)\n{\n  \
      \  // Use the animation kit ID for AI behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    to determine the complete animation behavior of a unit. The returned value may
    be zero if no animation kit has been assigned, which could indicate that the unit
    is not using any specific AI animation sequences.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return zero if no animation
    kit has been set, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the unit's behavior.
    The value should be validated before use in AI-related code.
