  class: ZoneChoice
  method: ZoneChoice
  signature: void ZoneChoice::ZoneChoice(const ZonePlacement * p, float suit)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a ZoneChoice object with specified placement and suitability
    values.
  description: The ZoneChoice constructor initializes a ZoneChoice object using a
    provided ZonePlacement pointer and a suitability score. This method sets up internal
    state for zone selection logic, likely used in AI pathfinding or zone-based decision
    making within the TrinityCore framework. The suitability parameter influences
    how strongly this choice is considered during zone evaluation processes. The method
    does not return any value but prepares the object for subsequent operations involving
    zone placement and selection.
  parameters:
  - name: p
    description: Pointer to a ZonePlacement object that defines the placement configuration
      for this zone choice. Must not be null for valid initialization.
  - name: suit
    description: Float value representing the suitability score of this zone choice.
      Higher values indicate better suitability for selection in zone-based algorithms.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic ZoneChoice Initialization
    code: 'ZonePlacement placement;

      ZoneChoice choice(&placement, 0.8f);

      // Initializes a zone choice with suitability score of 0.8'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using ZoneChoice in AI Logic
    code: 'ZonePlacement* placement = new ZonePlacement();

      placement->SetPosition(100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);

      ZoneChoice choice(placement, 0.95f);

      // Used in AI pathfinding to evaluate zone suitability'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore AI system for
    managing zone-based decision making. The ZonePlacement object should be properly
    initialized before passing to this constructor. Memory management of the ZonePlacement
    pointer must be handled appropriately by the caller.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'p' parameter will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the ZonePlacement object remains valid throughout the
    lifetime of the ZoneChoice instance.
