documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AuctionHouseBot class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AuctionHouseBot
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the auction house bot exists throughout
    the server's runtime. This method provides global access to the auction house
    bot functionality without requiring explicit instantiation. The returned pointer
    can be used to interact with the auction house bot's core features such as item
    listing, bidding, and management. This is particularly useful in TrinityCore's
    auction house system where the bot automates various marketplace operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single instance of the AuctionHouseBot class. Returns
    a valid pointer if the singleton has been initialized, or nullptr if the instance
    has not yet been created.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "AuctionHouseBot* ahBot = AuctionHouseBot::instance();\nif (ahBot != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the auction house bot instance\n    ahBot->Update();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Instance Validity
    code: "AuctionHouseBot* bot = AuctionHouseBot::instance();\nif (bot && bot->IsEnabled())\n\
      {\n    // Perform auction house operations\n    bot->ProcessAuctions();\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // Handle case where bot is not initialized or disabled\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Auction House Bot not available\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is typically created during server startup or on first access. The singleton ensures
    thread safety in TrinityCore's context, though developers should still consider
    potential race conditions during initialization. This method is commonly used
    throughout the auction house subsystem to access bot functionality.
  warnings: The returned pointer may be null if called before the singleton has been
    initialized. Always check for null before using the returned instance. Since this
    is a singleton, modifying state through this instance affects all parts of the
    code that use it, so be cautious with operations that might have global side effects.
