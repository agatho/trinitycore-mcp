  class: ClassAI
  method: GetOptimalPosition
  signature: int ClassAI::GetOptimalPosition(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal position for an AI-controlled unit to
    move towards a target.
  description: The GetOptimalPosition method determines the best location for an AI-controlled
    unit to navigate to in order to engage or approach a specified target. This method
    is typically used within the context of NPC behavior and pathfinding logic, where
    the AI must make decisions about movement based on various factors such as distance,
    obstacles, threat level, and combat positioning. The method evaluates the current
    state of the AI unit and its target to compute an optimal coordinate or position
    that aligns with strategic gameplay mechanics. It may consider factors like line
    of sight, terrain, and tactical positioning to ensure effective engagement.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or position
      index. This parameter specifies which entity the AI should calculate optimal
      positioning relative to.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the calculated optimal position index
    or identifier. A positive value typically indicates a successful calculation,
    while negative values may indicate failure or invalid input parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetOptimalPosition
    code: "int targetId = 12345;\nint optimalPos = ai->GetOptimalPosition(&targetId);\n\
      if (optimalPos >= 0) {\n    // Proceed with movement to optimal position\n \
      \   printf(\"Optimal position calculated: %d\\n\", optimalPos);\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to calculate optimal position\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making framework and should be called
    within appropriate game loop contexts. The target parameter must point to a valid
    entity identifier; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Implementation may vary depending
    on specific AI type and current combat state.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer for the target parameter can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the target entity exists and is accessible
    before calling this method.
