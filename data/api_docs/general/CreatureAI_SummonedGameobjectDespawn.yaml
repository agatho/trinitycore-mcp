documentation:
  brief: Removes a summoned game object from the world when invoked by the creature
    AI.
  description: The SummonedGameobjectDespawn method is used to destroy and remove
    a previously summoned GameObject from the game world. This method is typically
    called by CreatureAI implementations when a summoned object should be dismissed
    or removed, such as after a spell effect has completed or when the creature's
    AI logic determines the object is no longer needed. It ensures proper cleanup
    of the GameObject and removes it from all relevant systems including the map,
    grid, and object managers. The method does not perform any validation on the input
    GameObject pointer; it assumes the provided GameObject was previously summoned
    by this AI instance.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the GameObject that should be despawned. This GameObject
      must have been previously summoned using a valid summoning mechanism such as
      CreatureAI::SummonGameObject().
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in creature AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustDied()\
      \ override {\n        // Despawn any summoned GameObjects\n        if (summonedGO)\n\
      \            SummonedGameobjectDespawn(summonedGO);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Despawning multiple summoned objects
    code: "class BossAI : public CreatureAI {\nprivate:\n    std::vector<GameObject*>\
      \ summonedObjects;\npublic:\n    void DoDespawnAllSummons() {\n        for (auto&\
      \ go : summonedObjects)\n            if (go)\n                SummonedGameobjectDespawn(go);\n\
      \        summonedObjects.clear();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly calls the GameObject's RemoveFromWorld() function internally,
    which handles all necessary cleanup including removing from the map's object grids
    and notifying other systems. It is safe to call this method multiple times on
    the same GameObject, though it will have no effect after the first call. The GameObject
    pointer should not be accessed after calling this method as it may lead to dangling
    pointer issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid GameObject pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crash. Always verify that the GameObject exists
    and was summoned by this AI instance before calling this method. Additionally,
    if the GameObject is part of an active spell effect or has ongoing events, despawning
    it immediately may cause unexpected behavior in those systems.
