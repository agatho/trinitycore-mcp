  signature: bool Unit::IsWithinMeleeRangeAt(const int & pos, const Unit * obj) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit is within melee range of another unit.
  description: This method checks if the calling unit is within the standard melee
    range of the specified target unit. It evaluates the distance between units and
    returns true if the target is within melee range, false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used in combat mechanics to determine if a unit can attack another
    unit directly, such as when checking if an enemy is close enough to perform melee
    attacks or if a player can interact with an NPC. The method considers both the
    position of the calling unit and the target unit's position to calculate distance.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position parameter represents the target unit's location in world
      coordinates. This is typically used for checking if a unit is within melee range
      of another unit.
  - name: obj
    description: The obj parameter represents the target unit object that the calling
      unit is checking against. This parameter defines the unit whose position is
      being compared to determine if it's within melee range.
  returns: Returns true if the calling unit is within melee range of the specified
    target unit, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsWithinMeleeRangeAt(0, targetUnit)) {\n    // Do something\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the standard melee range calculation which typically includes
    a margin for accuracy. Performance considerations include checking distance calculations
    and avoiding unnecessary calls when not needed.
  warnings: The method may return false if the target unit is too far away or if the
    calling unit's position is not properly updated, which can lead to incorrect combat
    behavior in certain scenarios.
