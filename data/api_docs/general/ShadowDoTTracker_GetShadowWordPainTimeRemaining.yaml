  class: ShadowDoTTracker
  method: GetShadowWordPainTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 ShadowDoTTracker::GetShadowWordPainTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: 'Returns the time remaining in milliseconds for the Shadow Word: Pain DoT
    on a target.'
  description: 'The GetShadowWordPainTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left
    for the Shadow Word: Pain spell effect on a specified target. This method is typically
    used by shadow priests to track the status of their DoT (Damage over Time) spell
    on enemies. The returned value represents the time in milliseconds until the effect
    expires. If the target does not have Shadow Word: Pain applied, the method may
    return 0 or an undefined value depending on implementation. This functionality
    is crucial for optimal spell rotation and resource management during combat.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: 'The global unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to check
      for Shadow Word: Pain duration.'
  returns: 'A uint32 value representing the time remaining in milliseconds for the
    Shadow Word: Pain DoT effect on the specified target. Returns 0 if the effect
    is not active or if the target is invalid.'
  examples:
  - title: 'Check Shadow Word: Pain Duration on Target'
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nif (target)\n{\n    uint32 timeRemaining\
      \ = shadowDotTracker->GetShadowWordPainTimeRemaining(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      \    if (timeRemaining > 0)\n    {\n        // Shadow Word: Pain is active,\
      \ print remaining time\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Shadow Word: Pain has %u ms remaining.\", timeRemaining);\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        // Shadow Word: Pain is not active\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Shadow Word: Pain is not active on target.\");\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method assumes that the ShadowDoTTracker instance has proper tracking
    data for the specified GUID. The method should only be called with valid unit
    GUIDs to avoid undefined behavior. Performance is generally good as it's a lookup
    operation, but frequent calls may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the target GUID passed to this method corresponds to an actual
    unit in the game world. Passing invalid or non-existent GUIDs may lead to incorrect
    results or crashes. The returned time value is in milliseconds and should be handled
    accordingly when performing time-based calculations.
