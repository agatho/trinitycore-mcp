  class: ResourceCalculator
  method: GetManaCostCache
  signature: int & ResourceCalculator::GetManaCostCache()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the cached mana cost value used for spell calculations
    in the ResourceCalculator.
  description: The GetManaCostCache method retrieves a reference to an internal cached
    mana cost value stored within the ResourceCalculator class. This cache is typically
    populated during spell initialization or resource calculation phases and is used
    to optimize performance by avoiding repeated computations of the same mana cost
    values. The returned reference allows direct access and modification of the cached
    value, which can be useful for dynamic adjustments based on player state, buffs,
    or game mechanics such as mana regeneration rates or spell modifiers. This method
    is commonly invoked during spell casting sequences to quickly retrieve precomputed
    mana requirements without recalculating them each time.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to an integer representing the cached mana cost value. The
    returned value can be modified directly, which will update the internal cache
    state. This allows for dynamic adjustments to mana costs during gameplay, such
    as applying temporary modifiers or updating values based on character conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing and Modifying Cached Mana Cost
    code: 'ResourceCalculator calculator;

      int& manaCost = calculator.GetManaCostCache();

      manaCost = 500; // Update the cached value directly

      int currentCost = calculator.GetManaCostCache(); // Retrieve updated value'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Cached Mana Cost in Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void CastSpell(Player* player, SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    ResourceCalculator\
      \ calc;\n    int& cachedMana = calc.GetManaCostCache();\n    \n    if (player->GetPower(POWER_MANA)\
      \ >= cachedMana) {\n        player->ModifyPower(POWER_MANA, -cachedMana);\n\
      \        // Proceed with spell casting\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal member variable of the ResourceCalculator
    class. Modifying this value directly affects the cached state and should be done
    carefully to maintain consistency with game logic. The cache may be invalidated
    or updated by other methods in the class, so direct modifications should consider
    potential side effects on related calculations.
  warnings: Direct modification of the returned reference can lead to inconsistent
    state if not properly synchronized with other parts of the resource calculation
    system. Be cautious when modifying cached values during active spell processing
    as it may affect subsequent calculations or validations.
