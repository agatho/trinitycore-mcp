  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: HandleQuestChainProgression
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestChainProgression(Player * bot, uint32 completedQuestId)
documentation:
  brief: Processes quest chain progression when a player completes a quest in a quest
    chain.
  description: The HandleQuestChainProgression method manages the advancement of quest
    chains within the TrinityCore framework. When a player completes a quest that
    is part of a larger quest chain, this method ensures that subsequent quests in
    the chain are properly triggered or made available to the player. It handles the
    logic for updating quest states, checking prerequisites, and potentially awarding
    rewards or advancing quest objectives. This method is typically invoked internally
    by the core quest system when a quest completion event occurs, ensuring seamless
    progression through interconnected quests.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who completed
      the quest. This player's quest state and inventory will be updated accordingly.
  - name: completedQuestId
    description: The unique identifier (ID) of the quest that was just completed.
      This ID is used to determine if the quest is part of a chain and what subsequent
      quests should be activated.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Completion Handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    // Assume\
      \ questId is the ID of a completed quest\n    QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestChainProgression(player,\
      \ questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Quest Logic
    code: "class MyQuestHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void CompleteQuestAndAdvanceChain(Player*\
      \ player, uint32 questId)\n    {\n        // Perform custom quest completion\
      \ logic\n        player->PlayerTalkClass->SendCloseGossip();\n        \n   \
      \     // Trigger chain progression\n        QuestTurnIn::HandleQuestChainProgression(player,\
      \ questId);\n        \n        // Additional reward processing\n        player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_REWARD,\
      \ 1);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest system's ability to track quest
    dependencies and chain relationships. It assumes that the quest data in the database
    is correctly configured with proper chain links. The method may recursively process
    multiple quests if a chain has several sequential steps.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without verifying quest completion or chain
    integrity can lead to inconsistent quest states. Ensure that the player's quest
    log and objective states are properly synchronized before calling this method.
