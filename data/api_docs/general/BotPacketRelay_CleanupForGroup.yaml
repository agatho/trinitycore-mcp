  method: CleanupForGroup
  signature: void BotPacketRelay::CleanupForGroup(Player * bot, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Removes bot-related packet relay entries for a specified bot and group
  description: The CleanupForGroup method is responsible for cleaning up packet relay
    data associated with a specific bot within a given group. This function ensures
    that stale or obsolete relay entries are removed from the system, preventing memory
    leaks and maintaining the integrity of the packet relay mechanism. It typically
    gets invoked when a bot leaves a group or when group membership changes occur.
    The method operates on internal data structures that track which bots are relaying
    packets for which groups, ensuring proper cleanup without affecting other active
    group members or relay operations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose packet relay
      entries should be cleaned up. Must not be null.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group context for which
      cleanup should occur. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized

      Group* myGroup = ...; // Assume group is initialized

      BotPacketRelay::CleanupForGroup(myBot, myGroup);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Cleanup in Group Leave Scenario
    code: "void OnPlayerLeaveGroup(Player* player, Group* group)\n{\n    if (player->IsBot())\n\
      \    {\n        BotPacketRelay::CleanupForGroup(player, group);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal hash maps or lists that store
    packet relay mappings. It's important to ensure that both the bot and group pointers
    are valid before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior. The cleanup
    process may involve iterating through relay entries and removing those associated
    with the specified bot and group combination.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers for either parameter will likely
    result in a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure proper validation of input parameters
    before invocation. This method should only be called when it's safe to modify
    internal relay structures, as concurrent access could lead to race conditions.
