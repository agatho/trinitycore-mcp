  signature: void WorldSession::SendLfgRoleCheckUpdate(const lfg::LfgRoleCheck & pRoleCheck)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG role check update packet to the player's client.
  description: This method serializes and sends a LfgRoleCheck structure to the connected
    player's client, notifying them of changes in the Looking for Group (LFG) role
    check process. It is typically used when a player's potential roles or availability
    changes during a group finding operation. The packet informs the client about
    which roles are available, who is participating, and any updates to the role selection
    process. This method directly interacts with the network layer to deliver real-time
    LFG status updates to players.
  parameters:
  - name: pRoleCheck
    description: A constant reference to an LfgRoleCheck structure containing the
      current role check state information including player roles, group composition,
      and availability status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending Role Check Update
    code: 'lfg::LfgRoleCheck roleCheck;

      // ... populate roleCheck with data ...

      worldSession->SendLfgRoleCheckUpdate(roleCheck);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided LfgRoleCheck structure is valid and
    properly initialized. The actual packet serialization and sending occurs through
    the WorldSession's underlying network communication system. This method should
    only be called when there are actual changes to report, as excessive calls may
    impact performance.
