  method: GetAlwaysVisiblePhaseShift
  signature: const PhaseShift & PhasingHandler::GetAlwaysVisiblePhaseShift()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the always visible phase shift associated with the phasing handler.
  description: The GetAlwaysVisiblePhaseShift method retrieves a constant reference
    to the PhaseShift object that defines the always visible phase settings for this
    phasing handler. This phase shift is typically used to ensure certain game objects,
    areas, or events remain visible to players regardless of their normal phase restrictions.
    The returned PhaseShift object contains information about which phases are always
    active and how they interact with the player's current phase state. This method
    is commonly used in scenarios where specific content should be accessible under
    all circumstances, such as global world events or persistent quest markers.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a PhaseShift object that represents the always
    visible phase settings for this phasing handler. The returned object contains
    phase information that ensures certain game elements remain visible regardless
    of normal phasing rules.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Always Visible Phase Shift
    code: "const PhaseShift& alwaysVisiblePhase = phasingHandler->GetAlwaysVisiblePhaseShift();\n\
      if (alwaysVisiblePhase.HasPhase(1234))\n{\n    // This phase is always visible\n\
      \    // Perform actions accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PhaseShift object should not be modified directly as it represents
    a constant configuration. Modifications to the phase shift should be handled through
    appropriate phasing system APIs. This method does not perform any dynamic calculations
    and always returns the same reference, making it safe for repeated calls.
