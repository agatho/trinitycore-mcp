  class: CustomTabardInfo
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CustomTabardInfo::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player *
    owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes custom tabard information to a packet buffer for player creation.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the custom tabard data associated
    with a player into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for transmission to another player.
    This method is typically used when sending tabard information during player initialization
    or updates. The data includes details such as faction-specific tabard designs,
    colors, and patterns that are visible to other players in the game world. It ensures
    that tabard information is properly formatted and encoded before being sent over
    the network.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the tabard data will be written.
      This buffer is typically used for constructing network packets.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose tabard information is being serialized.
      This represents the player who owns the tabard data.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this tabard information.
      Used for determining visibility and access rights of the tabard data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in player creation context
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // some player

      Player* receiver = ...; // another player

      CustomTabardInfo tabardInfo;

      tabardInfo.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's networking system and should only
    be called when preparing data for network transmission. The implementation assumes
    that the Player objects passed in are valid and have initialized tabard information.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will cause crashes. This method
    does not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond basic null checks.
