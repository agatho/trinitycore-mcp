  class: InstanceMap
  method: SetInstanceScenario
  signature: void InstanceMap::SetInstanceScenario(InstanceScenario * scenario)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the scenario instance for this map.
  description: The SetInstanceScenario method assigns a scenario object to the current
    instance map, allowing the map to manage and track scenario-specific data and
    behavior. This is typically used during scenario creation or loading phases where
    a scenario needs to be associated with an instance map. The method does not validate
    whether the scenario is compatible with the map type, so it's expected that proper
    checks are performed before calling this method. Once set, the scenario object
    can be retrieved using GetInstanceScenario() and will influence how the map behaves
    during scenario events.
  parameters:
  - name: scenario
    description: Pointer to the InstanceScenario object to associate with this map.
      Must not be null.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetInstanceScenario
    code: 'InstanceScenario* myScenario = new InstanceScenario();

      instanceMap->SetInstanceScenario(myScenario);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting scenario with null check
    code: "if (myScenario != nullptr)\n{\n    instanceMap->SetInstanceScenario(myScenario);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly assigns the scenario pointer without performing any
    deep copy or reference counting. The caller is responsible for managing the lifetime
    of the InstanceScenario object to ensure it remains valid while the map is using
    it.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior
    or crashes. Ensure that the scenario object is properly initialized and valid
    before assignment. Also, avoid calling this method multiple times on the same
    map without first clearing or cleaning up previous scenario references.
