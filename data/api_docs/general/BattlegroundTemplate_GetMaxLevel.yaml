  class: BattlegroundTemplate
  method: GetMaxLevel
  signature: uint8 BattlegroundTemplate::GetMaxLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum allowed player level for this battleground template.
  description: The GetMaxLevel method retrieves the upper limit of player levels that
    are permitted to join a specific battleground type. This value is defined within
    the battleground template configuration and is used during player registration
    and queue processing to ensure level-appropriate matchmaking. The returned value
    represents the highest level at which players can participate in the battleground
    without being excluded due to level restrictions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the maximum allowed player level for this battleground
    template. Players above this level will be unable to join the battleground unless
    they have special permissions or exceptions.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve max level for a battleground
    code: 'BattlegroundTemplate* bgTemplate = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattlegroundTemplate(BATTLEGROUND_AV);

      uint8 maxLevel = bgTemplate->GetMaxLevel();

      TC_LOG_INFO(LOG_FILTER_BATTLEGROUND, "Maximum level for AV: %u", maxLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground initialization and player
    queue validation. The value returned should be consistent with the game's level
    cap and any specific restrictions defined in the battleground template configuration.
