  class: AssassinationDotTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 AssassinationDotTracker::GetTimeRemaining(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the remaining time in milliseconds for a specified dot spell on
    the target.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method returns the duration remaining for a specific
    damage-over-time (DoT) spell that has been applied to the target. This method
    is typically used by assassination rogue classes to track debuffs like Garrote,
    Rupture, or other harmful periodic effects. It allows the AI or script logic to
    determine how much time is left before a DoT effect expires, which can be crucial
    for timing abilities such as finishing moves, applying new dots, or managing resource
    usage. The method assumes that the spell ID corresponds to a valid dot spell that
    has been applied to the target and returns 0 if no active dot of the specified
    type exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the time remaining in milliseconds for the specified DoT spell.
    If the spell is not currently active on the target, or if an invalid spell ID
    is provided, it returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check Remaining Time of Garrote
    code: "uint32 garroteTime = dotTracker->GetTimeRemaining(703); // Garrote spell\
      \ ID\nif (garroteTime < 2000) {\n    // Apply new Garrote or use finishing move\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Time Remaining for Ability Timing
    code: "uint32 ruptureTime = dotTracker->GetTimeRemaining(1943); // Rupture spell\
      \ ID\nif (ruptureTime > 5000) {\n    // Use Envenom or other abilities that\
      \ benefit from active dots\n} else if (ruptureTime < 1000) {\n    // Refresh\
      \ Rupture before it expires\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AssassinationDotTracker class, which manages tracking
    of DoT effects for rogue assassination builds. The implementation likely relies
    on internal spell tracking mechanisms within TrinityCore's combat system. It should
    be called only when the target is valid and has active DoTs to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided spellId corresponds to a valid DoT spell that
    can be tracked by this class. Calling this method with an invalid or non-DoT spell
    ID may return unexpected values or 0. This method does not validate whether the
    target is currently in combat or affected by the specified spell.
