  method: ExecuteBalancedStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecuteBalancedStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns roles to group members using a balanced strategy to optimize team
    composition.
  description: The ExecuteBalancedStrategy method performs role assignment within
    a World of Warcraft group by analyzing member classes, levels, and other relevant
    attributes to distribute roles such as tank, healer, and damage dealer in a balanced
    manner. This ensures optimal team performance for dungeons, raids, or PvP scenarios.
    The method evaluates each group member's capabilities and assigns them to roles
    that best fit the overall team composition, aiming to maintain a balanced distribution
    of class types and specializations. It is typically invoked when a new group is
    formed or when role reassignment is needed for tactical reasons.

  - title: Basic Role Assignment Execution
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecuteBalancedStrategy(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that group members have valid class and level information.
    It may modify internal role state variables of group members. The strategy considers
    player specialization, class balance, and overall team needs to achieve optimal
    distribution.
  warnings: Calling this method on a group with insufficient members or without proper
    initialization may result in improper role assignments. Ensure that the Group
    object passed is valid and contains initialized players before calling this method.
