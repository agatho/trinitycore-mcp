  class: Player
  method: SetSkillStartingRank
  signature: void Player::SetSkillStartingRank(uint32 pos, uint16 starting)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the starting rank for a player's skill at the specified position.
  description: This method configures the initial skill level that a player will have
    when learning a specific skill. The skill is identified by its position in the
    skill list, and the starting rank determines the minimum skill level the player
    will possess upon learning the skill. This method is typically used during character
    creation or when modifying skill levels for players. The skill must be valid and
    the starting rank should be within acceptable limits for the game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position of the skill in the skill list, typically representing
      the index of the skill within the player's skill array.
  - name: starting
    description: The starting rank value that will be set for the skill. This value
      represents the minimum skill level the player will have when learning the skill,
      and must be a valid uint16 value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting skill starting rank
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillStartingRank(5, 10);

      // Sets the skill at position 5 to start at rank 10'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the player's skill management system and should be
    used carefully during character creation or when modifying skills. It affects
    how skills are initialized in the game world, and may influence gameplay mechanics
    related to skill progression.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect skill initialization,
    potentially affecting gameplay balance and player experience. Care must be taken
    to ensure that the starting rank value is valid and appropriate for the skill
    being modified.
