  signature: bool AuctionManager::BuyAuction(Player * bot, uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to purchase an auction item using the specified player bot and auction
    ID.
  description: The BuyAuction method facilitates the purchasing of items listed in
    the auction house by a player bot. It takes an auction ID and attempts to complete
    the transaction, deducting the required gold from the bot's inventory and delivering
    the item. This method is typically used in automated systems or AI-driven bots
    to manage in-game economics and inventory. The method returns true if the purchase
    is successful, or false if it fails due to insufficient funds, invalid auction
    ID, or other game-related constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to buy
      the auction item.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction entry to be purchased. Must correspond
      to a valid active auction in the auction house.
  returns: True if the auction item was successfully purchased; false otherwise. Failure
    may occur due to insufficient funds, invalid auction ID, or other game logic constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Auction Purchase
    code: "Player* myBot = ...;\nuint32 auctionId = 12345;\nbool success = sAuctionMgr->BuyAuction(myBot,\
      \ auctionId);\nif (success)\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"auction\", \"Successfully\
      \ purchased auction item %u.\", auctionId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      auction\", \"Failed to purchase auction item %u.\", auctionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the auction house system and may trigger
    various game events such as gold deduction, item delivery, and auction house updates.
    It is recommended to validate the auction ID and player's funds before calling
    this method to avoid unnecessary failures.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player object is a valid bot instance and not
    a real player. Also, be aware that purchasing an auction item may have immediate
    consequences on the bot's inventory and gold balance, so proper error handling
    should be implemented.
