documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's battleground or battlefield raid group and subgroup.
  description: This method assigns a player to a specific battleground or battlefield
    raid group, allowing them to participate in the corresponding instance. The method
    handles the player's group assignment within the context of battlegrounds and
    battlefields, ensuring proper positioning and coordination during combat. It is
    typically used when players are entering or leaving battleground instances, and
    helps maintain the integrity of group assignments during these events.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group to which the player belongs, representing the raid group
      in battlegrounds or battlefields. This parameter defines the player's participation
      in a specific battleground instance.
  - name: subgroup
    description: The subgroup index within the group, indicating the player's position
      within the raid. Values range from 0 to 15, with -1 indicating no subgroup assignment.

    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Group* group = new Group();

      player->SetBattlegroundOrBattlefieldRaid(group, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      Group* group = new Group();

      player->SetBattlegroundOrBattlefieldRaid(group, 15);

      of the raid'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during battleground or battlefield entry and
    exit events. It should be called when a player enters a battleground instance,
    ensuring proper group assignment for combat participation. The method does not
    directly handle player movement or teleportation, but rather manages the group
    assignment within the context of battlegrounds.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect group assignments during
    battleground events, potentially causing players to be placed in wrong subgroups
    or groups. Care should be taken when assigning subgroups to ensure correct positioning
    within raid groups.
