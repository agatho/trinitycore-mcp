documentation:
  brief: Restores the AI behavior of a Unit after it has been disabled.
  description: The RestoreDisabledAI method re-enables the artificial intelligence
    functionality for a Unit that was previously disabled using DisableAI(). This
    method is typically used to resume normal AI behavior during combat or other game
    events. The unit's AI state is restored to its previous configuration, allowing
    the unit to resume its intended behavior patterns such as targeting, movement,
    and spell casting. This method should only be called on units that have had their
    AI disabled previously.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to restore AI after disabling
    code: 'Unit* target = ...;

      target->DisableAI();

      // ... some logic ...

      target->RestoreDisabledAI();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the unit's AI was previously disabled using DisableAI().
    It does not perform any validation to ensure this precondition is met. The restoration
    process may involve reinitializing AI state variables and resetting behavior flags.
  warnings: Calling RestoreDisabledAI() on a unit whose AI has not been disabled may
    result in undefined behavior or unexpected AI actions. Always ensure that DisableAI()
    was called before calling this method.
