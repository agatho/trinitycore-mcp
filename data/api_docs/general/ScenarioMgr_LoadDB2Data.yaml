  method: LoadDB2Data
  signature: void ScenarioMgr::LoadDB2Data()
documentation:
  brief: Loads scenario data from the database into memory for active scenarios.
  description: The LoadDB2Data method initializes and loads scenario-related data
    from the DB2 files into the ScenarioMgr's internal data structures. This method
    is typically invoked during server startup or when reloading scenario configurations.
    It processes scenario templates, criteria, and related metadata necessary for
    tracking player progress and completing scenario objectives within the game world.
    The method ensures that all scenario definitions are available for use by players
    and that the scenario system can properly handle scenario-related events and rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeScenarios()\n{\n    sScenarioMgr->LoadDB2Data();\n\
      \    // Scenario data is now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    a full reload of scenario data is required. It's not thread-safe and must be executed
    on the main server thread. The method may take some time to complete depending
    on the number of scenarios defined in the DB2 files.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate scenario entries. Do not invoke this during active gameplay
    sessions as it may cause unexpected behavior in ongoing scenarios.
