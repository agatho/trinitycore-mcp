  class: AoEDecisionManager
  method: Update
  signature: void AoEDecisionManager::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the AoE decision manager's internal state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the AoEDecisionManager, which handles area-of-effect (AoE) spell casting
    decisions for AI-controlled units. This method is typically called from the main
    game loop at regular intervals, using a delta time value to determine how much
    time has passed since the last update. It evaluates conditions, manages cooldowns,
    and makes decisions about when to cast AoE spells based on the current situation.
    The method ensures that AI behavior remains responsive and realistic by updating
    decision-making logic in sync with game time progression.

  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sObjectMgr->GetUpdateDiff();\n  \
      \  if (aiCreature)\n        aiCreature->GetAoEDecisionManager()->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the AI update cycle. It's typically
    invoked once per game tick or frame, depending on the implementation. The diff
    parameter represents milliseconds since last update and is crucial for time-based
    calculations.
