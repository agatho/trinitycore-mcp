documentation:
  brief: Initializes and builds the grid linkage structure for the map's navigation
    system.
  description: The buildNGridLinkage method constructs the internal grid-based navigation
    structure used by the Map class to manage object placement, visibility, and movement
    within the game world. This method is typically called during map initialization
    or loading phases to establish the necessary data structures for efficient spatial
    queries and grid-based operations. It sets up relationships between adjacent grid
    cells to enable fast lookup of nearby objects and terrain features. The method
    prepares the map's internal grid system for use in pathfinding, object culling,
    and other spatial operations that depend on grid-based positioning.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Grid Initialization
    code: 'Map* myMap = sMapMgr->CreateMap(0, nullptr);

      myMap->buildNGridLinkage(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the map's grid data has been properly
    initialized. It performs no validation of existing grid structures and may overwrite
    previous linkage data. The method is typically invoked internally by the Map loading
    process and should not be called manually in most cases.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already initialized map without proper cleanup
    can lead to memory leaks or corrupted grid data. This method modifies internal
    grid structures and should only be used during map initialization or reset operations.
