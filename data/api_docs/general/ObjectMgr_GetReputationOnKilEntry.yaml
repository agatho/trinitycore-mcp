documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the reputation reward entry for killing a creature with a specific
    ID.
  description: The GetReputationOnKilEntry method fetches the ReputationOnKillEntry
    structure associated with a given creature ID. This entry defines the faction
    reputation rewards that players receive when they kill a creature of that type.
    The method is used primarily in the context of creature kill-based reputation
    mechanics, where different creatures provide different amounts of reputation to
    various factions. It returns a pointer to the entry if found, or nullptr if no
    such entry exists for the specified ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a const ReputationOnKillEntry structure that contains the
    reputation reward data for killing a creature with the specified ID, or nullptr
    if no such entry is defined in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use reputation on kill entry
    code: "const ReputationOnKillEntry* repEntry = sObjectMgr->GetReputationOnKilEntry(12345);\n\
      if (repEntry)\n{\n    // Process the reputation rewards\n    printf(\"Faction\
      \ ID: %u, Reward: %i\\n\", repEntry->faction, repEntry->repValue);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses a cached database lookup table that maps creature IDs
    to their respective reputation on kill entries. The data is typically loaded during
    server startup from the game's database tables such as creature_onkill_reputation.
