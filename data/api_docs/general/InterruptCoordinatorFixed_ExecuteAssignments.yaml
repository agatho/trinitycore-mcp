  class: InterruptCoordinatorFixed
  method: ExecuteAssignments
  signature: void InterruptCoordinatorFixed::ExecuteAssignments(uint32 currentTime)
documentation:
  brief: Executes all pending interrupt assignments for the current game tick.
  description: The ExecuteAssignments method processes and applies all interrupt assignments
    that have been queued for execution within the current game time frame. This method
    is typically invoked during the game loop's update cycle to ensure timely handling
    of interrupt-related events such as spell interruptions, movement halts, or other
    gameplay mechanics requiring immediate action. It iterates through the internal
    assignment queue and executes each pending interrupt based on its assigned priority
    and timing constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    interruptCoordinator.ExecuteAssignments(getMSTime());\n    // ... rest\
      \ of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from within the main game thread to maintain
    thread safety. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, processing assignments
    in O(n) time where n is the number of pending interrupts.
