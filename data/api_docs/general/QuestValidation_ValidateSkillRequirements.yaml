api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateSkillRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateSkillRequirements(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the skill requirements for a specified quest.
  description: The ValidateSkillRequirements method checks if the given player has
    the necessary skill levels and professions to take on the specified quest. It
    evaluates the player's current skill points, profession ranks, and any prerequisite
    skills required by the quest. This method is typically used during quest acceptance
    or validation processes to ensure players meet all requirements before proceeding.
    The function returns true if all skill conditions are satisfied, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate skill requirements
      for. Must be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player whose skill
      requirements are being validated. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all skill requirements for the specified
    quest, false otherwise. If the quest does not have any skill requirements defined,
    it returns true by default.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateSkillRequirements(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player cannot accept the quest due to skill requirements\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the required skills for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void OnQuestAccept(Player* player, Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateSkillRequirements(quest->GetQuestId(),\
      \ player)) {\n        player->SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_MISSING_SKILLS);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n\
      \    player->CompleteQuest(quest->GetQuestId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the game's internal quest database and skill system.
    It may perform database lookups to retrieve quest-specific skill requirements.
    The validation considers both base skill levels and profession ranks, including
    any required skill thresholds or prerequisites.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid null pointer exceptions. This method does not modify the player's state;
    it only performs validation checks.
