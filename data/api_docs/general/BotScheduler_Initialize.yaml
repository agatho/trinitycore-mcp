  class: BotScheduler
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool BotScheduler::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the bot scheduler system, setting up internal data structures
    and preparing for bot task management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares the BotScheduler class for operation
    by establishing necessary internal state, allocating resources, and configuring
    core scheduling parameters. This method must be called before any other bot scheduling
    operations can be performed. It typically sets up timers, initializes task queues,
    and ensures that all required subsystems are ready to handle bot behavior execution.
    The method performs validation checks on configuration settings and may return
    false if initialization fails due to missing dependencies or invalid configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the scheduler was successfully initialized with all required
    components and resources available; returns false if initialization failed due
    to missing dependencies, invalid configuration, or system resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "BotScheduler scheduler;\nbool success = scheduler.Initialize();\nif (success)\n\
      {\n    // Scheduler is ready for use\n    // Proceed with bot management operations\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to initialize BotScheduler\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the application lifecycle.
    Multiple calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The scheduler
    relies on proper configuration files and database connections to function correctly.
  warnings: Calling this method after the scheduler has already been initialized may
    cause memory corruption or inconsistent state. Ensure all required dependencies
    are available before calling Initialize.
