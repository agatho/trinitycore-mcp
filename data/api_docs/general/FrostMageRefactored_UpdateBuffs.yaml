  signature: void FrostMageRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the frost mage's buffs and aura states based on current game conditions
    and spell effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff effects on a Frost Mage character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This includes updating aura states, applying or removing spell modifiers, and
    ensuring that the player's combat effectiveness reflects the current set of active
    buffs. The method typically runs during each AI update cycle or when specific
    conditions are met, such as casting spells, taking damage, or entering/exiting
    combat. It interacts with the core TrinityCore spell system to maintain accurate
    buff tracking and ensures that the Frost Mage's performance remains consistent
    with game mechanics and class-specific abilities.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void FrostMageAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    m_frostMage->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the AI update loop or in response
    to spell events. It may internally call other methods like ApplyAura, RemoveAura,
    or UpdateSpellEffects. The implementation relies heavily on TrinityCore's aura
    system and should not be called directly during spell casting unless specifically
    designed for that purpose.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method outside of the proper AI update context as it
    may cause inconsistent buff states or race conditions. Ensure all spell effects
    are properly initialized before calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior.
