  signature: void InstanceScript::SendBossKillCredit(uint32 encounterId)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a boss kill credit to all players in the instance for the specified
    encounter.
  description: The SendBossKillCredit method is used within InstanceScript classes
    to award kill credits to players when a boss encounter is defeated. This method
    ensures that all players currently within the instance receive appropriate credit
    for defeating the boss, which may trigger achievements, quest progress, or other
    game mechanics tied to boss kills. The method typically handles internal tracking
    of encounter completion and broadcasts relevant updates to the client. It should
    be called after verifying that the boss has been successfully defeated and all
    necessary conditions are met.
  parameters:
  - name: encounterId
    description: Unique identifier for the boss encounter that was defeated. This
      ID corresponds to the encounter defined in the database or script and is used
      to track completion status and award appropriate rewards.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Boss Death Handler
    code: "void BossScript::OnDeath()\n{\n    // Perform boss-specific death logic\n\
      \    // ...\n    \n    // Award kill credit to all players in instance\n   \
      \ instance->SendBossKillCredit(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within encounter-specific scripts or
    boss AI logic. It's important to ensure that the encounterId matches the one defined
    in the database for proper tracking and reward distribution. The method internally
    handles player notifications and may trigger related events such as achievement
    checks.
  warnings: Calling this method before verifying that the boss is actually defeated
    can lead to incorrect credit assignment. Ensure that all preconditions for the
    boss defeat are met before invoking this function.
