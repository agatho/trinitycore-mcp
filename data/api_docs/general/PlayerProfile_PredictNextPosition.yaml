  method: PredictNextPosition
  signature: int PlayerProfile::PredictNextPosition(float deltaTime) const
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the player's next position based on current movement state and deltaTime.
  description: The PredictNextPosition method calculates and returns the expected
    future position of a player character, taking into account their current velocity,
    direction, and the time delta provided. This functionality is typically used for
    client-side prediction in multiplayer environments to reduce perceived latency.
    The method does not modify any internal state but instead provides a calculated
    result based on existing movement data. It assumes that the player's movement
    behavior follows standard physics principles such as constant velocity or simple
    acceleration.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the predicted position index or identifier within
    a movement path or trajectory sequence. A return value of -1 may indicate an error
    condition, such as invalid movement data or failure to calculate a valid prediction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Client Prediction
    code: "PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();\nint predictedPosition\
      \ = profile->PredictNextPosition(0.05f); // 50ms delta\nif (predictedPosition\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Use predictedPosition to update client-side position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for internal use in movement prediction
    systems and may rely on cached movement data. It should be called frequently enough
    to maintain smooth prediction accuracy, typically every frame or at fixed intervals
    during gameplay.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned position index directly corresponds to
    a world coordinate; it represents an abstracted prediction within the context
    of the movement system. Also, calling this method without valid movement state
    may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
