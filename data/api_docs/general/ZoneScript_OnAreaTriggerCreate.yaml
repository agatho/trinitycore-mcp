  method: OnAreaTriggerCreate
  signature: void ZoneScript::OnAreaTriggerCreate(AreaTrigger * areaTrigger)
documentation:
  brief: Called when an area trigger is created within the zone script's context.
  description: The OnAreaTriggerCreate method is a virtual callback function that
    gets invoked whenever an AreaTrigger object is instantiated and added to the zone
    managed by this ZoneScript. This method allows developers to execute custom logic
    when area triggers become active, such as initializing trigger-specific behaviors,
    setting up event handlers, or modifying the trigger's properties. It serves as
    a lifecycle hook for area triggers, enabling integration with custom game mechanics
    or quest systems that rely on area-based interactions. The method is part of the
    ZoneScript framework which provides a way to extend zone-level functionality in
    TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: areaTrigger
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that was created. This parameter
      represents the specific area trigger instance that triggered this callback.
      The pointer is guaranteed to be valid during the execution of this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation
    code: "class MyZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnAreaTriggerCreate(AreaTrigger*\
      \ areaTrigger) override\n    {\n        // Log when an area trigger is created\n\
      \        sLog->outString(\"Area trigger %u created in zone.\", areaTrigger->GetEntry());\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Trigger Behavior
    code: "class QuestZoneScript : public ZoneScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnAreaTriggerCreate(AreaTrigger*\
      \ areaTrigger) override\n    {\n        // Set up custom behavior for specific\
      \ triggers\n        if (areaTrigger->GetEntry() == 1234)\n        {\n      \
      \      areaTrigger->SetScriptId(5678); // Assign a custom script ID\n      \
      \      // Trigger some quest-related event\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the initialization phase of an AreaTrigger,
    so any modifications made to the areaTrigger object will be effective immediately.
    ZoneScript callbacks are executed on the main game thread and should avoid long-running
    operations that could block gameplay. The areaTrigger parameter is guaranteed
    to be valid for the duration of this call.
  warnings: Do not delete or modify the areaTrigger pointer directly within this method
    unless you're certain about the consequences, as it may lead to undefined behavior.
    Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations in this callback to
    maintain game performance.
