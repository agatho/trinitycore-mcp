  signature: void InterruptDatabase::Initialize()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the interrupt database system for handling spell and ability
    interruptions in the game world.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal data structures and resources
    required for the InterruptDatabase class to manage spell interruptions, such as
    those caused by damage, movement, or other player actions. This method typically
    prepares lookup tables, initializes memory pools, and configures system-wide settings
    necessary for tracking and processing interruption events during combat and gameplay.
    It is usually called once during server startup or module initialization to ensure
    the database is ready for use.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: InterruptDatabase::Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the server's initialization
    phase. Reinitializing the database after it has been set up may lead to undefined
    behavior or memory leaks. The method is typically invoked by the core server initialization
    process and does not require explicit calls from game logic modules.
