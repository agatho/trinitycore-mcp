documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MovementGenerator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MovementGenerator class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources allocated during the lifetime of the movement generator. In TrinityCore's
    context, movement generators control how units (such as players or creatures)
    move within the game world. This destructor ensures proper cleanup of memory and
    internal state when a movement generator object is no longer needed. It is automatically
    invoked by the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of MovementGenerator
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    MovementGenerator* mg = new MovementGenerator();\n\
      \    // ... use mg ...\n    delete mg; // Triggers ~MovementGenerator()\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically not called directly by developers but rather
    through the standard C++ object lifecycle management. MovementGenerator implementations
    may have specific cleanup logic depending on their type (e.g., idle, waypoint,
    follow, etc.).
