  method: UpdateRoleAssignment
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::UpdateRoleAssignment()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the role assignment for units within the adaptive behavior manager
    based on current conditions and group dynamics.
  description: The UpdateRoleAssignment method recalculates and assigns appropriate
    roles to units managed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This process considers
    factors such as unit health, threat levels, class specialization, and group composition
    to ensure optimal team performance during encounters. The method is typically
    invoked during combat updates or when significant changes occur in the group's
    state. It ensures that each unit assumes an appropriate role (such as tank, healer,
    or damage dealer) based on dynamic conditions rather than static assignments.
    This adaptive approach enhances the AI's ability to respond effectively to changing
    battlefield scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    adaptiveBehaviorManager.UpdateRoleAssignment();\n\
      \    // ... continue with updated role assignments ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during active combat scenarios to
    maintain optimal role distribution. It may have performance implications if invoked
    too frequently without proper throttling. The implementation likely involves internal
    state tracking and decision-making algorithms that evaluate multiple factors simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat contexts may result
    in incorrect role assignments or inconsistent behavior. Avoid calling it during
    initialization phases where unit states are not yet fully established.
