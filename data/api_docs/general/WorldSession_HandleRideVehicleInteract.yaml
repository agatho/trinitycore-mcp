documentation:
  brief: Handles player interaction with vehicle mounting mechanics in World of Warcraft.
  description: The HandleRideVehicleInteract method processes client requests to mount
    or dismount vehicles within the game world. This method is invoked when a player
    attempts to interact with a vehicle, typically by clicking on it or using a specific
    key binding. It validates the player's ability to interact with the target vehicle,
    checks for proper positioning and state conditions, and then either initiates
    the mounting process or sends appropriate error messages back to the client. The
    method ensures that only valid vehicle interactions occur based on player permissions,
    vehicle availability, and game mechanics such as combat status or vehicle ownership.
  parameters:
  - name: rideVehicleInteract
    description: A packet containing information about the vehicle interaction request
      including the target vehicle GUID, player's position, and interaction type (mount/dismiss).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Mounting Request
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleRideVehicleInteract(WorldPackets::Vehicle::RideVehicleInteract&\
      \ rideVehicleInteract)\n{\n    // Validate player is not in combat\n    if (GetPlayer()->IsInCombat())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Process vehicle mounting logic\n    GetPlayer()->Mount(rideVehicleInteract.VehicleGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core vehicle interaction system and relies heavily
    on player state validation. It should be called only when a valid vehicle interaction
    packet is received from the client, and it assumes proper synchronization between
    client and server states.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to players being unable to mount
    vehicles or experiencing unexpected behavior such as mounting without proper checks.
    Always validate player state before processing vehicle interactions.
