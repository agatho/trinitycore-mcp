documentation:
  brief: Initializes and begins execution of a conversation AI sequence
  description: The OnStart method is invoked when a ConversationAI object begins its
    execution cycle. This method typically handles the initial setup, state transitions,
    and preparation required for the conversation to proceed. It may initialize dialogue
    variables, register event handlers, or prepare the AI context before entering
    the active conversation loop. The method is part of the standard AI lifecycle
    and is called automatically by the TrinityCore framework when a conversation is
    triggered. This method does not accept any parameters and performs no return operations,
    serving purely as an initialization hook for the conversation AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversation Start
    code: "void MyConversationAI::OnStart()\n{\n    // Initialize conversation state\n\
      \    SetCurrentDialogueStep(0);\n    // Begin dialogue sequence\n    StartDialogue();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during the lifetime of a ConversationAI
    instance, immediately after the AI is instantiated and before any other conversation
    methods are invoked. It's important to ensure that all necessary initialization
    logic is contained within this method to avoid undefined behavior during conversation
    execution.
