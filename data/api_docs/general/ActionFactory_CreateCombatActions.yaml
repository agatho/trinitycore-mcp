  method: CreateCombatActions
  signature: int ActionFactory::CreateCombatActions(uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes combat actions for a specified class in the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The CreateCombatActions method is responsible for generating and setting
    up the default combat action behaviors for a given player class. This method typically
    initializes the action list that governs how a character will behave during combat,
    including spell casting, movement, and targeting decisions. It is commonly invoked
    during player initialization or when switching classes to ensure proper combat
    functionality. The method leverages the classId parameter to determine which set
    of actions should be created, ensuring that each class has appropriate combat
    behaviors tailored to its abilities and playstyle.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier representing the player class (e.g., WARRIOR
      = 1, PALADIN = 2, etc.). This value determines which combat actions are initialized
      for the character.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the success or failure of the action creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically signifies successful completion, while
    non-zero values may indicate errors such as invalid class ID or allocation failures.
  examples:
  - title: Initialize combat actions for a warrior
    code: "ActionFactory factory;\nint result = factory.CreateCombatActions(1); //\
      \ WARRIOR class\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Combat actions successfully initialized\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handle error case when creating combat actions
    code: "ActionFactory factory;\nint result = factory.CreateCombatActions(99); //\
      \ Invalid class ID\nif (result != 0) {\n    // Log error or handle invalid class\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Failed to create combat actions for invalid class ID\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during character creation or class switching
    within the TrinityCore framework. It may involve memory allocation for action
    nodes and should be invoked only when the ActionFactory instance is properly initialized.
    The method assumes that valid class definitions exist in the core configuration.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid classId may result in undefined behavior
    or failed initialization. Ensure that all class IDs passed are valid and correspond
    to registered classes within the TrinityCore system. Improper use could lead to
    crashes or corrupted action state.
