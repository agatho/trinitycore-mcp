  class: Battleground
  method: GetPrematureWinner
  signature: int Battleground::GetPrematureWinner()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID of the premature winner in a battleground if one exists.
  description: The GetPrematureWinner method checks whether a battleground has ended
    prematurely due to all players from one team leaving or becoming inactive. It
    returns the team ID (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) of the team that is declared
    the winner as a result of this premature termination. If no premature winner exists,
    it returns -1. This method is typically used during battleground cleanup and reward
    distribution to ensure proper team victory handling when the normal end conditions
    are not met.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the team ID (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) of the
    premature winner, or -1 if no premature winner exists.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Premature Winner
    code: "if (bg->GetPrematureWinner() == 0)\n{\n    // Alliance has won prematurely\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_A_PREMATURE_WIN);\n}\nelse if (bg->GetPrematureWinner()\
      \ == 1)\n{\n    // Horde has won prematurely\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_H_PREMATURE_WIN);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No premature winner\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_BG_NO_PREMATURE_WIN);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the battleground system to determine
    if a game ended before normal completion. The premature win condition typically
    occurs when players disconnect or leave the battleground, and the remaining team
    is automatically declared winner.
  warnings: Do not use this method to determine general battleground status; it should
    only be used for handling special cases related to premature termination. The
    return value of -1 does not indicate an error but rather that no premature win
    occurred.
