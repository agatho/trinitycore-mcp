  signature: bool LFGRoleDetector::IsTankSpec(uint32 specId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified specialization ID corresponds to a tank
    role in World of Warcraft.
  description: The IsTankSpec method evaluates a given specialization identifier to
    determine if it represents a tanking class specialization within the TrinityCore
    framework. This utility function is primarily used in LFG (Looking for Group)
    systems and raid role assignment logic to identify which player specializations
    are suitable for tanking roles. The method checks against predefined tank specializations
    for all classes that can tank in World of Warcraft, including Death Knights, Druids,
    Paladins, Warriors, and others depending on the game version. It returns true
    if the spec ID maps to a tank role, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided specId corresponds to a tank specialization;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a spec is a tank role
    code: 'LFGRoleDetector detector;

      bool isTank = detector.IsTankSpec(250); // Returns true for Blood Death Knight

      printf("Is tank spec: %s\n", isTank ? "true" : "false");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal mappings of specialization IDs to role types.
    The implementation may vary between different World of Warcraft expansions and
    patches. Developers should ensure that specId values passed to this method are
    valid specialization identifiers from the game's current data.
