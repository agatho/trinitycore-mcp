  class: InteractionManager
  method: FindNearbyNPCs
  signature: int InteractionManager::FindNearbyNPCs(Player * bot, NPCType type, float
    range) const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the count of nearby NPCs of a specified type within a given
    range for a player bot.
  description: The FindNearbyNPCs method searches for non-player characters (NPCs)
    of a specific type within a defined radius around a player bot. It iterates through
    the game world's NPC entities, checking their proximity to the bot and matching
    their type against the provided parameter. This method is typically used in AI
    logic to determine available interaction targets such as vendors, trainers, or
    quest givers. The method returns an integer representing the number of matching
    NPCs found within range. It does not modify any game state directly but provides
    data for decision-making in bot behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      is searching for nearby NPCs. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value specifying the type of NPC to search for (e.g.,
      vendor, trainer, quest giver). Values are typically defined in the NPCType enumeration.
  - name: range
    description: Floating-point value indicating the maximum distance (in yards) from
      the bot's position within which NPCs should be considered. Must be a positive
      number.
  returns: An integer representing the count of NPCs found that match the specified
    type and are within the given range. Returns zero if no matching NPCs are found
    or if invalid parameters are passed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby vendors
    code: int vendorCount = interactionManager.FindNearbyNPCs(playerBot, NPCType::Vendor,
      10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding quest givers within a larger range
    code: int questGiverCount = interactionManager.FindNearbyNPCs(playerBot, NPCType::QuestGiver,
      25.0f);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a spatial query using the game's internal world object
    management system. It may have performance implications when used frequently or
    with large ranges, as it iterates through all NPCs in the vicinity. The range
    parameter is measured in yards and should be carefully tuned based on gameplay
    requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior. Passing negative range values may lead to unexpected results
    or errors. The NPCType enumeration must be properly defined and consistent with
    the game's internal NPC categorization system.
