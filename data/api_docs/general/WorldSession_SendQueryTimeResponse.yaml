documentation:
  brief: Sends a server time query response packet to the client
  description: The SendQueryTimeResponse method constructs and sends a packet containing
    the current server time to the connected client. This functionality is typically
    invoked in response to a client-side time query request, allowing the client to
    synchronize its local time with the server's authoritative time. The method utilizes
    the WorldSession's underlying network infrastructure to transmit the time data,
    ensuring that the client receives an accurate timestamp for gameplay-related time-sensitive
    operations.

    code: "void HandleTimeQuery(WorldPacket& recvData)\n{\n    SendQueryTimeResponse();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the session's connection state and will only send data
    if the client is properly connected. The server time is typically retrieved using
    system time functions and may be adjusted for game-specific time zones or in-game
    time scaling factors.
