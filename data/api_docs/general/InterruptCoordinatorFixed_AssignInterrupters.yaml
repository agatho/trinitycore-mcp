documentation:
  brief: Assigns interrupters to the interrupt coordinator for managing spell interruptions.
  description: The AssignInterrupters method initializes and assigns available interrupters
    to the InterruptCoordinatorFixed instance. This method is responsible for setting
    up the internal data structures that track which entities can interrupt spells,
    typically used in combat scenarios where players or NPCs may interrupt ongoing
    spell casts. The method ensures that all relevant interrupter objects are properly
    registered with the coordinator so they can respond to interruption events during
    gameplay. It is generally called during initialization or when the coordinator
    needs to refresh its list of available interrupters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.AssignInterrupters();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the coordinator's initialization
    phase. Repeated calls may result in duplicate registrations or undefined behavior.
    The method assumes that interrupter objects are already created and available
    in the system.
