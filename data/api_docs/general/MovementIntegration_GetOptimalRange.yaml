  class: MovementIntegration
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float MovementIntegration::GetOptimalRange(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for the unit's current movement
    behavior.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    Unit should engage its target during combat. This value is derived from the unit's
    current movement integration state, including its type, speed, and combat behavior
    settings. The returned float represents the distance in yards. This method is
    primarily used by AI systems to make decisions about when to approach or retreat
    from targets, and it considers factors such as the unit's weapon range, spell
    casting requirements, and movement capabilities. It does not take any parameters
    and relies on internal state information of the MovementIntegration instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the optimal engagement range in yards. This
    value indicates the distance at which the unit should ideally position itself
    relative to its target for maximum effectiveness during combat.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Decision Making
    code: "float optimalRange = movementIntegration->GetOptimalRange(targetUnit);\n\
      if (me->GetDistance(targetUnit) > optimalRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n\
      \    me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(targetUnit, optimalRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles and relies on the
    internal state of the MovementIntegration object. The returned value may vary
    based on the unit's current combat stance, equipped weapons, or spell casting
    abilities. Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight as it only performs
    calculations based on existing internal state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed to this method is valid and not null
    before calling. Calling this method on a destroyed or invalid unit may result
    in undefined behavior. The returned range value does not account for terrain or
    obstacles, which may affect actual combat effectiveness.
