  class: KitingManager

  signature: int KitingManager::AdjustKitingForGroup(const int & intended, const int
    & group)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts kiting behavior based on group composition and intended kiting value
  description: The AdjustKitingForGroup method modifies the intended kiting value
    according to group dynamics, such as player count, roles, and positioning. This
    method is typically used in AI systems to optimize mob kiting behavior when multiple
    players are involved. It evaluates the current group state and adjusts the kiting
    parameters accordingly to maintain balanced gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: intended
    description: The intended kiting value that represents the desired kiting behavior
      or distance from target
  - name: group
    description: The group composition identifier or group size that influences kiting
      adjustment logic
  returns: Returns an adjusted kiting value that accounts for group dynamics, ensuring
    optimal gameplay balance when multiple players are involved in combat
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AdjustKitingForGroup
    code: 'int baseKiting = 10;

      int groupSize = 3;

      int adjustedKiting = kitingManager.AdjustKitingForGroup(baseKiting, groupSize);

      // adjustedKiting now reflects modified kiting behavior based on group size'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AdjustKitingForGroup in AI decision making
    code: "int CalculateOptimalKiting(const Unit* target, const Group* group)\n{\n\
      \    int baseKiting = GetBaseKitingDistance(target);\n    int groupAdjustment\
      \ = group ? group->GetMembersCount() : 1;\n    return kitingManager.AdjustKitingForGroup(baseKiting,\
      \ groupAdjustment);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in TrinityCore's AI system to dynamically adjust
    kiting behavior for mobs based on group composition. The adjustment logic may
    consider factors like group size, player roles, and positioning. It should be
    called before applying kiting calculations to ensure proper combat balance.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid positive integers. Passing negative
    values or zero may lead to unexpected behavior in kiting calculations. This method
    assumes the group parameter represents a meaningful group composition identifier.
