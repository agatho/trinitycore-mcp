  signature: void MapManager::AddSC_BuiltInScripts()
documentation:
  brief: Registers all built-in scripts with the map manager for execution.
  description: The AddSC_BuiltInScripts method is responsible for initializing and
    registering all core built-in scripts within the TrinityCore server environment.
    This includes scripts that are essential for basic game functionality such as
    creature AI, game object behaviors, and other fundamental systems. The method
    ensures these scripts are properly loaded into the map manager's script registry
    so they can be executed when appropriate during world updates. It typically runs
    during server startup or initialization phases to prepare all necessary components
    for runtime operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    sMapMgr->AddSC_BuiltInScripts();\n\
      \    // Continue with other startup procedures\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically only be called once during server initialization.
    It's part of the internal framework setup and generally not intended for direct
    use by custom script developers. The method may internally call multiple registration
    functions for different categories of built-in scripts.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate script registrations
    or unexpected behavior. It should only be invoked during the server's initialization
    phase before normal operation begins.
