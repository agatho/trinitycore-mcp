  class: PlayerbotConfig
  method: ValidateTimingSettings
  signature: bool PlayerbotConfig::ValidateTimingSettings()
documentation:
  brief: Validates all timing-related configuration settings for player bot behavior.
  description: The ValidateTimingSettings method checks the integrity and correctness
    of timing-related parameters within the PlayerbotConfig class. This includes verifying
    that time-based thresholds, delays, and intervals are within acceptable ranges
    and logically consistent. The method ensures that bot behavior timing configurations
    do not contain invalid values that could lead to unexpected behavior or performance
    issues. It performs validation on various timing settings such as update intervals,
    action delays, and cooldown periods to maintain proper bot operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all timing settings are valid and within acceptable ranges;
    returns false if any timing configuration fails validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "PlayerbotConfig config;\nbool isValid = config.ValidateTimingSettings();\n\
      if (!isValid) {\n    // Handle invalid timing settings\n    LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\"\
      , \"Invalid timing settings detected in configuration\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation in Configuration Loading
    code: "void LoadPlayerBotConfig() {\n    PlayerbotConfig config;\n    if (config.ValidateTimingSettings())\
      \ {\n        LOG_INFO(\"playerbot\", \"Player bot timing settings validated\
      \ successfully\");\n        // Proceed with normal initialization\n    } else\
      \ {\n        LOG_ERROR(\"playerbot\", \"Failed to validate player bot timing\
      \ settings\");\n        // Handle error or use defaults\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during configuration loading or initialization
    phases to ensure that all timing parameters are properly set. The validation process
    may involve checking for negative values, zero values where positive values are
    required, and logical consistency between related timing parameters such as update
    intervals and action delays.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper configuration initialization may result
    in undefined behavior. The method assumes that configuration data has been loaded
    prior to validation. If timing settings are invalid, the bot's behavior may become
    unpredictable or inefficient.
