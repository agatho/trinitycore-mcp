api:
  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: RegisterDebuff
  signature: void DispelCoordinator::RegisterDebuff(int target, uint32 auraId)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a debuff aura on a target for dispel coordination purposes.
  description: The RegisterDebuff method is used to track and manage debuff auras
    applied to targets within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that
    debuffs are properly registered in the dispel coordinator system, allowing for
    accurate tracking of which auras can be removed through dispel effects. The method
    takes a target identifier and an aura ID to associate the debuff with the specified
    target. This functionality is crucial for proper spell interaction handling, particularly
    when dealing with dispel mechanics and aura management in World of Warcraft-style
    gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The identifier of the target unit that will receive the debuff. This
      typically represents a GameObject, Creature, or Player entity within the game
      world.
  - name: auraId
    description: The unique identifier of the aura (debuff) being registered. This
      corresponds to the spell ID or aura entry used in the game's spell system to
      identify specific debuff effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Debuff Registration
    code: 'DispelCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.RegisterDebuff(12345, 1234);

      // Registers a debuff with ID 1234 on target with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Debuffs
    code: 'DispelCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.RegisterDebuff(playerGuid, 4567);

      coordinator.RegisterDebuff(playerGuid, 8901);

      // Registers two different debuffs on the same player target'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell application or aura creation
    events. The registration process does not directly apply the aura to the target;
    it only tracks it for dispel coordination purposes. Developers should ensure that
    the target and auraId parameters are valid before calling this method to prevent
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid target IDs or aura IDs may lead
    to inconsistent dispel tracking behavior. Always verify that targets exist and
    auras are properly defined in the spell system before registration.
