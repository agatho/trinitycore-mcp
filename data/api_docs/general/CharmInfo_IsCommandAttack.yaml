  method: IsCommandAttack
  signature: bool CharmInfo::IsCommandAttack()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the charmed unit is currently in command attack mode.
  description: The IsCommandAttack method checks if the charmed unit (such as a pet
    or minion) is currently operating in command attack mode. This mode typically
    indicates that the unit will automatically attack targets based on commands given
    by its owner, rather than following its own AI behavior. The method returns true
    when the charmed unit is actively in command attack state, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for managing pet behavior in World of Warcraft's
    combat system, particularly when players issue attack commands to their summoned
    creatures.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the charmed unit is currently in command attack mode, indicating
    it will automatically attack targets based on owner commands; returns false if
    the unit is not in command attack mode or is operating under normal AI behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Check if pet is in command attack mode
    code: "if (player->GetPet()->GetCharmInfo()->IsCommandAttack()) {\n    // Pet\
      \ is currently attacking based on command\n    sLog->outString(\"Pet is in command\
      \ attack mode\");\n} else {\n    // Pet is not in command attack mode\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Pet is not in command attack mode\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with CharmInfo's command handling
    system. The implementation likely checks internal state flags that control how
    the charmed unit responds to attack commands from its owner.
