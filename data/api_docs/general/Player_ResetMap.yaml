documentation:
  brief: Resets the player's current map to its default state.
  description: The ResetMap method resets the player's current map to its default
    state, effectively clearing any temporary map modifications or changes that may
    have occurred during gameplay. This method is typically used when a player needs
    to return to their original map after performing actions such as entering a dungeon
    or instance, or when resetting the game world state for specific mechanics. The
    method ensures that all map-related data is properly reset and that the player's
    position within the map is restored to its default configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ResetMap();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    map reset operations, and developers should be aware that it may affect player's
    position within the game world. It is recommended to use this method in conjunction
    with other map-related methods for complete control over player's map state.
  warnings: Improper use of ResetMap can cause unexpected behavior in player's position
    or map state during gameplay, particularly when used outside of normal game mechanics
    context.
