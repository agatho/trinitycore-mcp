  method: ShouldUseConsumables
  signature: bool CombatStateAnalyzer::ShouldUseConsumables() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player should use consumable items during combat based
    on current combat state and resource levels.
  description: The ShouldUseConsumables method evaluates the current combat state
    of a player to decide if it is appropriate to consume items such as potions, food,
    or other consumables. This decision is typically made based on factors like health,
    mana, combat duration, and available resources. The method is part of the CombatStateAnalyzer
    class which is responsible for analyzing various aspects of player combat behavior.
    It returns true when the system determines that using a consumable would be beneficial
    for maintaining optimal performance during combat, and false otherwise. This functionality
    is crucial for AI-driven decision making in automated players or bots.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player should use consumables based on current combat
    state and resource levels; returns false if no consumables should be used at this
    time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "if (combatAnalyzer->ShouldUseConsumables()) {\n    // Attempt to use a\
      \ health potion\n    player->UseItem(HEALTH_POTION);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely considers factors such as current health/mana percentages,
    time since last consumable usage, and combat duration. It may also take into account
    the type of enemy being fought and expected damage output.
  warnings: The method should not be called outside of combat situations where it
    might return misleading results. Ensure proper initialization of combat state
    variables before calling this method.
