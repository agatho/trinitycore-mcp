  class: LevelBracket
  method: GetCount
  signature: uint32 LevelBracket::GetCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of levels contained within the level bracket.
  description: The GetCount method retrieves the count of levels that are defined
    within a specific LevelBracket object. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore to determine how many distinct level ranges or tiers exist within
    a given bracket, which can be important for calculating rewards, scaling difficulties,
    or managing player progression systems. The method does not modify any internal
    state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of levels included in this
    level bracket. Returns zero if the bracket contains no levels or is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Bracket Size
    code: 'LevelBracket bracket;

      // Assume bracket has been initialized with some level data

      uint32 count = bracket.GetCount();

      printf("This bracket contains %u levels.\n", count);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely a read-only accessor and should be safe to call from
    any thread context, assuming the LevelBracket object itself is properly synchronized
    or immutable during use.
