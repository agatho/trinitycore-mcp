documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QFunction object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The QFunction destructor is automatically invoked when a QFunction
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, internal data structures, or system
    resources held by the QFunction instance. In the context of TrinityCore's AI and
    quest systems, QFunction objects are typically used to represent quest-related
    functions or callbacks that need to be properly disposed of when no longer needed.
    The destructor performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and
    maintain system stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Destruction
    code: 'QFunction* func = new QFunction();

      // ... use the function ...

      delete func; // Triggers ~QFunction()'
    language: cpp
  - title: Automatic Destruction on Scope Exit
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    QFunction func;\n    // ... use func ...\n}\
      \ // ~QFunction() automatically called here"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class, ensuring proper cleanup
    of derived class objects. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction process typically
    involves calling base class destructors and cleaning up any allocated resources.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on a stack-allocated object; let the
    compiler handle automatic destruction. Avoid manual memory management with new/delete
    in favor of smart pointers when possible to prevent resource leaks.
