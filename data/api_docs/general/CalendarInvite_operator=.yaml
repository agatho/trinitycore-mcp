  brief: Moves the contents of another CalendarInvite object to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator for the CalendarInvite class transfers
    ownership of resources from the source CalendarInvite object to the current object.
    This operation is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate
    CalendarInvite objects need to be efficiently transferred without unnecessary
    copying. The method performs a move semantics operation, leaving the source object
    in a valid but unspecified state. In the context of TrinityCore's calendar system,
    this would be used when assigning calendar invitations between objects during
    event creation, modification, or deletion operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current CalendarInvite object after the move assignment
    has been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'CalendarInvite invite1;

      CalendarInvite invite2 = std::move(invite1); // Uses move assignment

      // invite1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move Assignment in Container Operations
    code: 'std::vector<CalendarInvite> invites;

      CalendarInvite newInvite;

      invites.push_back(std::move(newInvite)); // Move assignment during vector push

      // newInvite is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics which is more efficient than copy semantics.
    The source object after move assignment should not be used in any operations that
    require its previous state. This operator is typically generated automatically
    by the compiler for classes that don't explicitly define it, but may be explicitly
    implemented to provide custom move behavior.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object should
    not be accessed or used in any way that depends on its previous state. The object
    will be left in a valid but unspecified state, and attempting to use it could
    lead to undefined behavior.
