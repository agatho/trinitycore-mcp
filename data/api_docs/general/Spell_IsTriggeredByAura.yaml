  method: IsTriggeredByAura
  signature: bool Spell::IsTriggeredByAura(const SpellInfo * auraSpellInfo) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is triggered by a specific aura.
  description: This method checks if the current spell instance is triggered by a
    particular aura spell, returning true if the spell's effect is activated by the
    specified aura. It is commonly used in spell processing logic to identify when
    one spell triggers another, particularly in cases involving aura effects such
    as proc mechanics or triggered spells. The method evaluates the relationship between
    the current spell and the provided aura spell information, ensuring that the spell's
    trigger conditions are met.
  parameters:
  - name: auraSpellInfo
    description: A pointer to the SpellInfo structure representing the aura that may
      be triggering this spell. This parameter defines the specific aura being checked
      for triggering relationship.
  returns: Returns true if the current spell is triggered by the specified aura spell,
    false otherwise. The method evaluates whether the spell's trigger conditions match
    those defined by the provided aura spell information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spell->IsTriggeredByAura(auraSpellInfo)) {\n    // Handle triggered\
      \ spell logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "if (spell->IsTriggeredByAura(auraSpellInfo) && spell->GetCaster()->GetTypeId()\
      \ == TYPEID_PLAYER) {\n    // Check if player triggered spell\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine trigger relationships. It may be called during spell processing or
    aura application logic, and performance considerations should be taken into account
    when used frequently in loops.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it relies on the SpellInfo
    structure being valid and properly initialized. Incorrect usage can lead to invalid
    memory access or unexpected behavior if the auraSpellInfo is null or improperly
    defined.
