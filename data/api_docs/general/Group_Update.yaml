  class: Group
  method: Update
  signature: void Group::Update(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the group's state and members' information based on the elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the group's internal
    state by processing timed events, synchronizing member data, and handling group-related
    operations such as loot distribution, member status updates, and quest progress
    tracking. This method is typically called by the game loop at regular intervals
    to ensure that all group members remain synchronized with the current game state.
    It handles tasks like updating player positions, checking for disconnected members,
    managing group loot settings, and ensuring that group-specific buffs or debuffs
    are properly applied or removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    if (Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup())\n    {\n        group->Update(100); // Update group\
      \ state with 100ms elapsed time\n    }\n    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly by the game engine's main update loop.
    The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since last update, which is used
    for timing-based operations within the group. The method may perform network synchronization
    and internal state management, so it's important that it's called consistently
    to maintain group integrity.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect time deltas can cause unexpected behavior
    in group loot distribution or member status updates. Do not call this method from
    multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
