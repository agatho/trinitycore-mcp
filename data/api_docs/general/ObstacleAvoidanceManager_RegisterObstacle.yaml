  method: RegisterObstacle
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::RegisterObstacle(const ObstacleInfo &
    obstacle)
documentation:
  brief: Registers an obstacle with the obstacle avoidance manager for pathfinding
    calculations.
  description: The RegisterObstacle method adds a new obstacle to the internal tracking
    system of the ObstacleAvoidanceManager. This allows the AI system to avoid collisions
    with the registered obstacle when calculating movement paths. The method takes
    an ObstacleInfo object that contains all necessary details about the obstacle,
    such as its position, size, and type. Once registered, the obstacle will be considered
    during pathfinding operations for units that use this manager. The registration
    is typically performed during initialization or when new environmental obstacles
    are dynamically added to the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: obstacle
    description: A const reference to an ObstacleInfo object containing all relevant
      data about the obstacle to be registered, including position, dimensions, and
      collision properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic obstacle registration
    code: 'ObstacleInfo info;

      info.position = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      info.radius = 5.0f;

      info.type = ObstacleType::Static;

      manager.RegisterObstacle(info);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering multiple obstacles in a loop
    code: "std::vector<ObstacleInfo> obstacles;\n// ... populate obstacles vector\
      \ ...\nfor (const auto& obs : obstacles)\n{\n    manager.RegisterObstacle(obs);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during map initialization or when dynamic
    obstacles are added to the world. The obstacle data should be valid and not null,
    otherwise undefined behavior may occur. Performance considerations include avoiding
    frequent registration of small obstacles; batch processing is recommended for
    many small objects.
  warnings: Do not register the same obstacle multiple times without unregistering
    it first, as this can lead to incorrect pathfinding behavior. Ensure that obstacle
    positions are in the correct coordinate system expected by the manager (typically
    world coordinates).
