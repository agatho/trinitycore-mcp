  class: Unit
  method: SetHover
  signature: bool Unit::SetHover(bool enable, bool updateAnimTier)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables hover state for the unit, allowing it to float above
    ground.
  description: The SetHover method controls whether a unit can hover above the ground.
    When enabled, the unit will float in place without touching the ground, which
    is useful for certain game mechanics like flying or special effects. The method
    returns true if the hover state was successfully set, false otherwise. This functionality
    is typically used during combat or when applying specific buffs/ debuffs that
    require hovering behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      the hover state for the unit.
  - name: updateAnimTier
    description: When true, updates the animation tier associated with the hover state.
      This parameter controls whether the visual animation changes are applied immediately
      or deferred.
  returns: Returns true if the hover state was successfully set, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate that the unit is not capable of hovering
    or that the operation failed due to invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hover Enable
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit();\nbool success = unit->SetHover(true, true);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Hover enabled successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Hover with Animation Update
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetHover(false, false);

      // Disable hover without updating animation tier'
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely interacts with the unit''s movement
    handler and animation system. It may require synchronization with server-side
    logic to ensure proper behavior during combat or special effects. Performance
    considerations include potential overhead from updating animation tiers, especially
    in high-frequency scenarios.'
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where a unit needs to maintain
    ground contact for gameplay reasons, such as during combat or when applying certain
    buffs that require ground-based interaction. Using it incorrectly may lead to
    unexpected behavior or visual glitches.
