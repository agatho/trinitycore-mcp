documentation:
  brief: Removes invalid or orphaned guild data from the database and memory caches
  description: The CleanupGuildData method performs a cleanup operation on guild-related
    data within the TrinityCore database. It removes entries that are no longer valid,
    such as guilds with no members, or guild members who no longer exist in the player
    database. This method ensures data integrity by eliminating orphaned references
    and stale guild information that could cause issues during guild operations or
    server maintenance. The cleanup process typically runs during server startup or
    periodic maintenance tasks to keep the guild system in a consistent state.

    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

  notes: This method should be called during server initialization or maintenance
    windows to avoid potential data inconsistencies. It may perform database queries
    that could impact performance on large servers with many guilds.
  warnings: Calling this method while guild operations are actively occurring may
    result in temporary data inconsistency or errors. It's recommended to run this
    during low-traffic periods or server maintenance.
