  class: InterruptAwareness

  signature: void InterruptAwareness::RegisterSpellCompleteCallback(int callback)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a callback function to be invoked when a spell completes execution.
  description: The RegisterSpellCompleteCallback method allows developers to register
    a callback that will be triggered whenever a spell finishes its execution process.
    This mechanism is typically used in custom AI or scripting systems where specific
    actions need to be taken upon spell completion. The callback parameter should
    represent a valid function pointer or delegate that handles the post-spell logic.
    This method integrates with TrinityCore's event-driven architecture for spell
    lifecycle management.
  parameters:
  - name: callback
    description: An integer identifier representing the registered callback function.
      This value is typically obtained through a registration system and must correspond
      to a previously registered spell completion handler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Completion Callback Registration
    code: 'InterruptAwareness awareness;

      int myCallback = 42; // Assume this is a pre-registered callback ID

      awareness.RegisterSpellCompleteCallback(myCallback);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The callback registration system relies on internal ID mapping within the
    InterruptAwareness class. Ensure that the callback identifier is valid and corresponds
    to an existing registered handler before calling this method.
  warnings: Incorrect callback IDs may lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors.
    Always validate callback identifiers against the system's registered callbacks
    before attempting registration.
