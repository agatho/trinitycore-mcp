  class: Group
  method: SetMemberReadyChecked
  signature: void Group::SetMemberReadyChecked(MemberSlot * slot)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the ready check status for a group member identified by the provided
    slot.
  description: The SetMemberReadyChecked method updates the ready check status for
    a specific group member, marking them as having responded to a group ready check.
    This method is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework during group
    operations such as dungeon or raid readiness verification. The method takes a
    MemberSlot pointer which identifies the specific group member whose ready status
    should be updated. It does not validate whether the slot is valid or if the player
    is actually in the group, so callers must ensure proper synchronization and state
    management. This method is part of the group management system and directly affects
    the internal ready check state used by the game's group mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: Pointer to the MemberSlot structure identifying the group member
      whose ready check status will be updated. The slot must represent a valid group
      member, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Ready Check Status for a Group Member
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    MemberSlot* slot\
      \ = group->GetMemberSlot(player->GetGUID());\n    if (slot)\n    {\n       \
      \ group->SetMemberReadyChecked(slot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during internal game state transitions when
    a player responds to a ready check. It's important to note that this method does
    not perform any validation on the provided slot, so it should only be called with
    valid member slots from the group. The method modifies internal group state and
    may affect group operations like instance locking or raid readiness.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null MemberSlot pointer can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the slot is valid before
    calling this method. This method should not be used directly by external code
    unless you are certain of the internal group state and member slot validity.
