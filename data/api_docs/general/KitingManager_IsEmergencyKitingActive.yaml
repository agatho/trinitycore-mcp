documentation:
  brief: Checks if emergency kiting is currently active for the player.
  description: The IsEmergencyKitingActive method determines whether the player is
    currently in an emergency kiting state. This state typically occurs when the player's
    health drops below a certain threshold or when the system detects an imminent
    threat that requires immediate evasive action. The method returns true if emergency
    kiting is active, indicating that the AI or player movement behavior has been
    adjusted to prioritize survival over other objectives such as maintaining position
    or following a specific path. Emergency kiting usually involves aggressive fleeing
    behavior, avoidance of enemy attacks, and prioritization of escape routes over
    normal gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if emergency kiting is currently active for the player, false
    otherwise. This indicates that the system has detected an urgent need for evasive
    maneuvers due to low health or imminent danger.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (player->GetKitingManager()->IsEmergencyKitingActive()) {\n    // Player\
      \ is currently in emergency kiting mode\n    // Handle special behavior like\
      \ avoiding combat or fleeing\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Logic
    code: "void MyAI::Update() {\n    KitingManager* kitingMgr = player->GetKitingManager();\n\
      \    if (kitingMgr->IsEmergencyKitingActive()) {\n        // Override normal\
      \ movement behavior\n        MoveToSafeLocation();\n    } else {\n        //\
      \ Resume normal AI behavior\n        FollowTarget();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other kiting-related methods
    to determine overall kiting behavior. The emergency kiting state may be automatically
    triggered by the system based on health thresholds or combat conditions, and can
    be cleared when the player's situation improves. This method should be called
    frequently during AI updates to ensure responsive behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with movement logic,
    as emergency kiting may override normal pathfinding behavior. The state might
    change rapidly during combat, so frequent checks could lead to inconsistent behavior
    if not properly handled.
