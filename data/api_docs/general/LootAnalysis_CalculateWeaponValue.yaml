  class: LootAnalysis
  method: CalculateWeaponValue
  signature: float LootAnalysis::CalculateWeaponValue(Player * player, const LootItem
    & item)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the relative value of a weapon item for a given player based on
    loot analysis mechanics.
  description: The CalculateWeaponValue method determines the estimated worth of a
    weapon item within the context of a player's current loot distribution and itemization
    preferences. This function is typically used in loot analysis systems to help
    determine optimal loot allocation strategies or to evaluate the relative desirability
    of different weapon types for specific players. The calculation considers factors
    such as weapon type, damage statistics, enchantments, and player class-specific
    preferences. It returns a normalized float value representing the weapon's relative
    value compared to other potential loot items.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the weapon value is being calculated.
      Must be a valid player instance with initialized loot preferences and itemization
      data.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure representing the weapon being
      evaluated. The item must contain valid weapon data including type, stats, and
      enchantments.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated relative value of the weapon
    for the specified player. Higher values indicate more desirable weapons based
    on the player's preferences and current loot context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weapon Value Calculation
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Valid player instance\nLootItem item = ...; //\
      \ Valid weapon loot item\nfloat value = LootAnalysis::CalculateWeaponValue(player,\
      \ item);\nif (value > 50.0f) {\n    // This weapon is considered highly valuable\
      \ for the player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Weapon Value in Loot Distribution Logic
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nLootItem item1 = ...;\nLootItem item2 = ...;\nfloat\
      \ value1 = LootAnalysis::CalculateWeaponValue(player, item1);\nfloat value2\
      \ = LootAnalysis::CalculateWeaponValue(player, item2);\nif (value1 > value2)\
      \ {\n    // Prioritize item1 for this player\n} else {\n    // Prioritize item2\
      \ for this player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's loot analysis system and assumes that
    the player object has been properly initialized with relevant loot preferences.
    The implementation may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore being
    used, as loot mechanics are subject to updates and modifications.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and item parameters are valid before calling this
    method. Passing null pointers will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The calculated value is relative and should not be treated as an absolute monetary
    value.
