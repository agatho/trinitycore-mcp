  class: Channel
  method: SilenceAll
  signature: void Channel::SilenceAll(const Player * player, const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Silences all players in the specified channel, preventing them from speaking.
  description: The SilenceAll method mutes all members of a given channel, effectively
    preventing them from sending messages or participating in chat. This function
    is typically used by moderators or administrators to enforce channel rules or
    manage disruptive users. The method operates on the channel identified by its
    name and applies the silence effect to all connected players in that channel.
    It does not affect the player who initiated the command, only other participants.
    The silence remains active until manually lifted or until the channel is destroyed.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object initiating the silence command. This
      player must have appropriate permissions to silence others in the channel.
  - name: name
    description: String representing the name of the channel to be silenced. The channel
      must exist and be accessible by the calling player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Silence All Players in a Channel
    code: 'Player* moderator = ...; // Assume player has permissions

      std::string channelName = "ModerationChannel";

      channel->SilenceAll(moderator, channelName);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal channel state flags to prevent message
    transmission. It may also send notification messages to affected players indicating
    they have been silenced.
  warnings: Improper use of this function can lead to player frustration and potential
    abuse if not properly restricted to authorized personnel. Ensure proper permission
    checks are in place before calling this method.
