documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given name is reserved by the server and cannot be used for character
    creation or other operations.
  description: The IsReservedName method determines whether a specified name is reserved
    within the TrinityCore server environment. Reserved names typically include administrative
    terms, forbidden words, or names that are already in use by system components.
    This check is crucial during character creation and name validation processes
    to ensure compliance with server rules and prevent conflicts. The method performs
    a case-insensitive lookup against an internal list of reserved names maintained
    by the ObjectMgr class.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the provided name is found in the reserved list, indicating
    it cannot be used; otherwise returns false if the name is available for use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sObjectMgr->IsReservedName(\"Admin\")) {\n    // Handle reserved name\n\
      \    printf(\"Name 'Admin' is reserved.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Character Creation Validation
    code: "std::string playerName = \"NewPlayer\";\nif (sObjectMgr->IsReservedName(playerName))\
      \ {\n    // Reject character creation\n    return false;\n}\n// Proceed with\
      \ normal character creation\nreturn true;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in an internal data structure that is likely
    pre-loaded at server startup. It's designed to be efficient for frequent checks
    during gameplay operations such as character name validation. The implementation
    may involve hash tables or similar fast-access structures for optimal performance.
  warnings: Developers should not rely solely on this check for security purposes,
    as it's primarily intended for game logic and user experience rather than preventing
    malicious input. Additionally, the list of reserved names can be modified through
    configuration files or database entries, so behavior may vary between different
    server instances.
