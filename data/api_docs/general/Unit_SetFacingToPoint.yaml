  class: Unit
  method: SetFacingToPoint
  signature: void Unit::SetFacingToPoint(const int & point, bool force)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the facing direction of the unit towards a specified point.
  description: This method adjusts the orientation of a Unit object to face towards
    a given point in world coordinates. It is commonly used in game mechanics for
    controlling NPC or player movement, particularly when dealing with pathfinding
    or positioning. The method allows for precise control over the unit's direction,
    which can be crucial for proper interaction with the environment or other entities.
    The force parameter determines whether the facing change should be immediate or
    gradual, affecting how the unit turns towards the target point.
  parameters:
  - name: point
    description: The coordinate point (x, y, z) that the unit should face towards.
      This is typically represented as a const reference to a coordinate structure.
  - name: force
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to force an immediate turn or allow
      for gradual movement. If true, the unit will immediately face the point; if
      false, it will gradually turn towards the point over time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetFacingToPoint(point, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with gradual turn
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetFacingToPoint(point, false);

      // This allows for smooth turning towards the point'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely involves internal
    calculations of angle differences between current facing and target point, with
    possible interpolation or direct assignment depending on the force parameter.
    Performance considerations include potential impact on movement updates if used
    frequently during pathfinding operations.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    movement-related methods, as improper usage can lead to unexpected behavior such
    as sudden teleportation or incorrect orientation. Also, ensure that the point
    coordinates are valid and within bounds before calling this method.
