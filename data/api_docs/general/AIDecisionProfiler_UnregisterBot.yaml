  method: UnregisterBot
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::UnregisterBot(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a bot from the AI decision profiling system by its unique identifier.
  description: The UnregisterBot method removes a specified bot from the AI decision
    profiler's tracking system. This function is typically called when a bot is no
    longer active or has been disconnected from the game world. The method takes the
    bot's unique identifier (GUID) as input and performs cleanup operations within
    the profiling system to ensure that no further AI decision data is collected for
    this bot. This helps maintain accurate profiling metrics and prevents memory leaks
    in the system.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to be unregistered from the
      AI decision profiler. This value should correspond to a valid bot entity that
      was previously registered with the profiler.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnregisterBot Usage
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      profiler->UnregisterBot(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unregister Bot with Error Handling
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nif (botGuid != 0)\n\
      {\n    profiler->UnregisterBot(botGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ GUID case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision profiling system used for analyzing
    bot behavior in TrinityCore. It's important to ensure that bots are properly unregistered
    when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks or incorrect profiling data.
    The profiler may internally maintain a map or list of registered bots, and this
    function removes an entry from that structure.
  warnings: Calling UnregisterBot with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or errors. It's recommended to verify that the bot was previously
    registered before attempting to unregister it. Additionally, calling this method
    on a bot that is currently being profiled could lead to race conditions if not
    properly synchronized.
