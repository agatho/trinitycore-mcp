  class: TransportMgr
  method: CreateTransportsForMap
  signature: void TransportMgr::CreateTransportsForMap(Map * map)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes all transport entities for the specified map.
  description: The CreateTransportsForMap method is responsible for instantiating
    and setting up all transport objects (such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving
    platforms) that are defined for a given map in the TrinityCore world. This method
    is typically invoked during map loading or initialization to ensure that transports
    are properly registered with the game world and can be interacted with by players.
    It iterates through the transport definitions associated with the map and creates
    corresponding GameObject instances, attaching them to the map's transport system.
    The method ensures that all necessary data for transport movement, such as waypoints
    and schedules, is loaded and initialized correctly.
  parameters:
  - name: map
    description: A pointer to the Map object for which transports need to be created.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid map instance within
      the game world.
  returns: This method does not return any value (void).
  examples:
  - title: Creating Transports for a Specific Map
    code: "Map* myMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0);\nif (myMap)\n{\n    sTransportMgr->CreateTransportsForMap(myMap);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called during map loading and should not be invoked
    manually unless you are implementing custom map or transport logic. The creation
    process involves reading transport data from the database and setting up internal
    structures for movement calculations.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized Map pointer can result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the map is fully loaded before invoking
    this function.
