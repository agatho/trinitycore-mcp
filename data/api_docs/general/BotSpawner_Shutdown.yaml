documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot spawner system, terminating all active bot spawning operations
    and cleaning up associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the bot
    spawner system within TrinityCore. It ensures that all currently spawned bots
    are properly removed from the game world, any ongoing spawning processes are halted,
    and all allocated memory and resources are freed. This method is typically invoked
    during server shutdown or when the bot spawner functionality needs to be temporarily
    disabled. The operation is designed to be thread-safe and will not leave any dangling
    references or active threads in the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotSpawner* spawner = BotSpawner::GetSingleton();

      spawner->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where it
    can safely terminate all bot operations. It's recommended to call this method
    before server shutdown or when disabling bot functionality to prevent memory leaks
    or undefined behavior.
