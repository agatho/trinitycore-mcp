  class: FuryWarriorRefactored
  method: ShouldUseWhirlwind
  signature: bool FuryWarriorRefactored::ShouldUseWhirlwind() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Fury Warrior should use the Whirlwind ability based
    on current combat state and resource levels.
  description: This method evaluates the Fury Warrior's current situation to decide
    if using the Whirlwind ability is beneficial. It considers factors such as available
    rage, number of targets in melee range, and the warrior's overall combat strategy.
    The method returns true when Whirlwind should be used, and false otherwise. This
    decision-making process is crucial for optimal damage output during fights with
    multiple enemies or when the warrior has sufficient rage to justify the ability
    usage.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Fury Warrior should use Whirlwind at this moment, based
    on combat conditions and resource availability; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "if (warrior->ShouldUseWhirlwind()) {\n    warrior->CastSpell(WHIRLWIND_SPELL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void FuryWarriorRefactored::UpdateAI() {\n    if (ShouldUseWhirlwind())\
      \ {\n        DoCast(WHIRLWIND_SPELL);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Other\
      \ combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely checks for multiple targets within melee range and sufficient
    rage to cast Whirlwind. It may also consider the warrior's current stance, buff/debuff
    states, and target health percentages to make an informed decision.
