  method: GetComputeEfficiency
  signature: float LearningAnalytics::GetComputeEfficiency(uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the compute efficiency ratio for a specified bot based
    on resource usage and performance metrics.
  description: The GetComputeEfficiency method computes the efficiency of a bot's
    computational performance by evaluating how effectively it utilizes system resources
    relative to its processing output. This metric is typically used in AI-driven
    automation systems within the TrinityCore framework to monitor and optimize bot
    behavior. The method takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID) as input and returns
    a floating-point value representing the efficiency ratio, where values closer
    to 1.0 indicate optimal performance. The calculation may consider factors such
    as CPU cycles consumed, memory usage, and task completion time. This method is
    particularly relevant in environments with multiple bots competing for resources,
    allowing administrators or analytics systems to identify underperforming or resource-intensive
    bots.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose compute efficiency is being
      evaluated. Must correspond to a valid active bot within the system.
  returns: A float value representing the compute efficiency ratio for the specified
    bot. Values typically range from 0.0 (inefficient) to 1.0 (optimal). Returns 0.0
    if the bot GUID is invalid or not found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float efficiency = analytics->GetComputeEfficiency(12345);\nif (efficiency\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    // Bot is performing efficiently\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Loop
    code: "for (uint32_t guid : botGuids) {\n    float eff = analytics->GetComputeEfficiency(guid);\n\
      \    if (eff < 0.5f) {\n        // Log inefficient bot\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot %u has low efficiency: %.2f\", guid, eff);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve performance overhead due to resource calculations
    and should be called judiciously in high-frequency scenarios. The efficiency calculation
    is based on internal metrics that may vary depending on the bot's task type and
    system load conditions.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID will return
    0.0, which might mask errors if not properly validated. Ensure all GUIDs are verified
    before calling to avoid misinterpretation of results.
