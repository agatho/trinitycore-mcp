documentation:
  brief: Initializes and activates the strategy for use within the bot AI system.
  description: The OnActivate method is called when a strategy is activated within
    the TrinityCore bot AI framework. This method serves as the entry point for initializing
    strategy-specific behavior, setting up internal state, and preparing the strategy
    to be executed during the bot's decision-making process. It is typically invoked
    by the AI system when a strategy becomes active in the current context, such as
    when switching between different combat or non-combat behaviors. The method allows
    strategies to perform necessary setup operations like registering event handlers,
    initializing variables, or configuring behavior parameters before the strategy
    begins influencing the bot's actions.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that owns this strategy. This parameter
      provides access to the AI context and allows the strategy to interact with the
      bot's state, decision-making system, and other components of the AI framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Activation
    code: "class MyCombatStrategy : public Strategy {\npublic:\n    void OnActivate(BotAI*\
      \ ai) override {\n        // Initialize combat-specific settings\n        ai->SetCombatMode(true);\n\
      \        // Register event handlers or set up behavior\n        strategyInitialized\
      \ = true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is invoked during the AI lifecycle and should not perform heavy
    operations that could block the main thread. Strategies should avoid making direct
    calls to game server functions or performing expensive computations in OnActivate.
    The ai parameter is guaranteed to be valid when this method is called, but it's
    recommended to validate pointers before use.
  warnings: Do not assume that all AI components are fully initialized when OnActivate
    is called. Avoid modifying the AI state in a way that could cause recursion or
    infinite loops. Ensure that any resources allocated in OnActivate are properly
    cleaned up in OnDeactivate if needed.
