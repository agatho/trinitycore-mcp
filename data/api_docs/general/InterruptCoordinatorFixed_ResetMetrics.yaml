documentation:
  brief: Resets all performance metrics and counters within the interrupt coordinator.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated performance data and
    statistics tracked by the InterruptCoordinatorFixed class. This includes resetting
    internal counters, timers, and any metric collections that may have been updated
    during gameplay or system operation. The method is typically invoked to prepare
    the coordinator for a new measurement period or to clear stale data before restarting
    monitoring. It ensures a clean state for subsequent metric collection without
    affecting the operational status of the interrupt handling system.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'InterruptCoordinatorFixed coordinator;

      coordinator.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may reset internal tracking data that could affect ongoing interrupt analysis.
    It's recommended to call this only when a fresh metric baseline is required.
