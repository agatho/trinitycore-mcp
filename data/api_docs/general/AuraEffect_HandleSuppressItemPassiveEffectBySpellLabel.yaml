    * aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a passive item effect suppression based on spell label.
  description: This method handles the application or removal of an aura effect that
    suppresses passive item effects associated with a specific spell label. It is
    typically invoked during aura application or removal events to modify how certain
    items behave in the game world. The suppression affects passive abilities or bonuses
    granted by items, preventing them from activating when the aura is active. This
    mechanism allows for complex interactions between auras and item-based effects,
    such as preventing certain enchantments or set bonuses from functioning while
    the aura is applied.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the aura being
      applied or removed. This contains information about the aura's state and target.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation, indicating whether this is an application
      (1) or removal (0) event. Used internally to determine behavior during aura
      transitions.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the effect should be applied (true) or
      removed (false). Controls the direction of the suppression logic.
  returns: null

    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleSuppressItemPassiveEffectBySpellLabel(const AuraApplication*\
      \ aurApp, uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Suppress\
      \ passive item effects for spell label\n        // Implementation logic here\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Restore suppressed passive item effects\n        //\
      \ Implementation logic here\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system and should only be called
    from within the context of an aura application or removal process. It relies on
    internal spell label matching to determine which item effects to suppress. The
    suppression logic may involve iterating through affected items and modifying their
    active state.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect behavior in item passive
    effects, potentially causing unexpected gameplay mechanics or exploits. Ensure
    that the spell label used for suppression is correctly defined and matches the
    intended items.
