documentation:
  brief: Sets an error message for the BotAIInitializer instance
  description: The SetError method assigns an error message to the BotAIInitializer
    object, typically used to track initialization failures or configuration issues
    within the AI system. This method allows the AI subsystem to communicate error
    conditions back to calling code or logging systems. The error message is stored
    internally and can be retrieved later for debugging or reporting purposes. This
    method is commonly invoked during the initialization phase of bot AI components
    when validation checks fail or when unexpected conditions occur.
  parameters:
  - name: error
    description: A constant reference to a std::string containing the error message
      to be set. This string should describe the nature of the error that occurred
      during AI initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an error message during bot AI initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      // Simulate a configuration error

      initializer.SetError("Invalid bot class specified in configuration");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using SetError with dynamic error construction
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      std::string errorMessage = "Failed to load AI script for bot ID: " + std::to_string(botId);

      initializer.SetError(errorMessage);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple assignment operation and does not trigger any
    additional side effects. The error message is stored in the object's internal
    state and may be accessed through other methods such as GetError(). This method
    is thread-safe when used on separate instances, but concurrent access to the same
    instance from multiple threads should be avoided.
