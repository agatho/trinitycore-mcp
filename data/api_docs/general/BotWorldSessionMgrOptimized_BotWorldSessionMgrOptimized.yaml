documentation:
  brief: Copies the state of another BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized instance.
  description: This method performs a deep copy of the state from another BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
    object. It is typically used during object initialization or when transferring
    session management data between instances. The copied data includes all internal
    session handles, bot configurations, and associated world session information.
    This operation ensures that the target instance becomes an exact replica of the
    source instance in terms of session state and configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Copying BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized Instance
    code: 'BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized sourceManager;

      // ... initialize sourceManager ...

      BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized newManager(sourceManager);

      // newManager now contains a copy of all session data from sourceManager'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is likely implemented as a copy constructor. It should be
    used carefully in performance-critical sections due to potential overhead of copying
    large session datasets. The implementation may involve locking mechanisms to ensure
    thread safety during the copy operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the source object is in a consistent state before copying,
    as copying an inconsistent state may lead to undefined behavior or session corruption.
    Avoid copying frequently in tight loops due to potential performance impact.
