  class: ArenaTeam
  method: GetMember
  signature: ArenaTeamMember * ArenaTeam::GetMember(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an arena team member by their name from the arena team.
  description: The GetMember method searches through the arena team's member list
    to find and return a pointer to the ArenaTeamMember structure that corresponds
    to the specified player name. This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft's
    arena system to access specific team member data for operations such as updating
    statistics, checking membership status, or managing team roster information. The
    method performs a linear search through the internal member list and returns NULL
    if no matching member is found. It is important to note that the name comparison
    is case-sensitive and must match exactly with the stored member name.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The exact name of the arena team member to search for. This parameter
      must be a valid player name string that matches the member's recorded name in
      the arena team roster.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the ArenaTeamMember structure if a matching member
    is found, or NULL if no member with the specified name exists in the arena team.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(teamId);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    ArenaTeamMember* member = team->GetMember(\"PlayerName\");\n    if (member)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process the member data\n        printf(\"Found member: %s\\\
      n\", member->name.c_str());\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        printf(\"Member\
      \ not found\\n\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Member Statistics
    code: "ArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamById(12345);\nif (team)\n\
      {\n    ArenaTeamMember* member = team->GetMember(\"HeroicPlayer\");\n    if\
      \ (member)\n    {\n        // Update member's win/loss statistics\n        member->personalRating\
      \ += 50;\n        member->matchmakerRating += 50;\n        member->weekGames++;\n\
      \        member->weekWins++;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the arena team's internal member
    list, which may impact performance for large teams. The method is not thread-safe
    and should be used with appropriate locking mechanisms when accessed from multiple
    threads. The returned pointer is valid only as long as the arena team exists and
    the member has not been removed.
  warnings: The method returns NULL if no matching member is found, so always check
    the return value before dereferencing the pointer to avoid null pointer exceptions.
    Be aware that name comparisons are case-sensitive, and exact matches are required
    for successful lookups.
