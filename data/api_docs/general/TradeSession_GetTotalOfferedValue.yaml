documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total value of all items offered in the trade
    session
  description: The GetTotalOfferedValue method computes the cumulative monetary value
    of all items currently offered by both players in a trade session. This value
    is typically used to determine if the trade meets certain requirements, such as
    minimum gold thresholds or to calculate the final trade outcome when items are
    exchanged. The method aggregates the item values based on their current market
    worth, vendor prices, or other valuation mechanisms defined within the TrinityCore
    framework. It does not account for any modifications that might occur during the
    trade process, such as enchantments or durability changes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total monetary worth of all items offered
    in the trade session. This value is expressed in copper coins, where 100 copper
    equals 1 silver and 100 silver equals 1 gold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Trade Value
    code: "TradeSession* session = player1->GetTradeData();\nuint64 totalValue = session->GetTotalOfferedValue();\n\
      if (totalValue >= 1000000) // 100 gold\n{\n    // Proceed with high-value trade\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Trade Values Between Players
    code: "TradeSession* session = player1->GetTradeData();\nuint64 player1Value =\
      \ session->GetTotalOfferedValue();\nuint64 player2Value = session->GetTradeData()->GetTotalOfferedValue();\n\
      if (player1Value > player2Value)\n{\n    // Player 1 is offering more value\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only considers items that have been added to the trade window
    and does not include any pending or future item additions. The calculation excludes
    currency (gold/silver/copper) directly entered into the trade window, focusing
    solely on item values. This function may be called frequently during trade interactions,
    so performance is optimized for quick execution.
  warnings: The returned value may not reflect real-time market changes if items are
    modified after being added to the trade. Be cautious when using this value in
    scenarios where item properties change dynamically, such as with enchantments
    or durability.
