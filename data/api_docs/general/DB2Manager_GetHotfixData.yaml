documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the hotfix data identifier used for database synchronization in
    TrinityCore.
  description: The GetHotfixData method returns a constant reference to an integer
    representing the current hotfix data identifier. This identifier is crucial for
    tracking and applying database hotfixes in TrinityCore, ensuring that client and
    server data remain synchronized. The method typically accesses internal database
    management structures to fetch this value, which may be updated during server
    startup or when hotfixes are applied. It's commonly used in conjunction with the
    hotfix system to determine whether a particular record requires an update or if
    the current data is up-to-date.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the current hotfix data
    identifier. This value typically corresponds to a version number or timestamp
    indicating the last applied hotfix, used for synchronization between client and
    server databases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int hotfixId = *DB2Manager::GetHotfixData();\nif (hotfixId > currentVersion)\n\
      {\n    // Apply hotfix logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore's database management
    system. The returned reference points to an internal member variable that should
    not be modified directly. Performance-wise, this is a fast operation as it only
    returns a cached value.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference as it points to an internal data
    member. Modifying it could lead to inconsistent state in the database management
    system. Ensure proper synchronization when accessing this value in multi-threaded
    environments.
