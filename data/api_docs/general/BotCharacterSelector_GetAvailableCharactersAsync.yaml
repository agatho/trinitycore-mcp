  class: BotCharacterSelector
  method: GetAvailableCharactersAsync
  signature: void BotCharacterSelector::GetAvailableCharactersAsync(uint32 accountId,
    const int & request, CharacterListCallback callback)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of available bot characters for a specified account asynchronously.
  description: The GetAvailableCharactersAsync method fetches all bot characters associated
    with a given account ID and invokes a provided callback function upon completion.
    This asynchronous operation allows the game server to handle multiple character
    queries without blocking the main thread. The method is typically used in bot
    management systems where players interact with automated characters. It ensures
    that only valid, existing bot characters are returned, and handles potential database
    or network errors gracefully through the callback mechanism.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the player account for which to retrieve available
      bot characters. Must be a positive integer representing a valid account in the
      database.
  - name: request
    description: Reference to an integer that identifies the specific request or context.
      Used internally to track and correlate asynchronous operations, typically passed
      by reference to maintain state.
  - name: callback
    description: Function pointer or callable object that will be invoked when the
      character list retrieval is complete. The callback should accept a CharacterListResult
      parameter containing the retrieved characters or error information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of GetAvailableCharactersAsync
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint request = 1;\nBotCharacterSelector selector;\n\
      \nselector.GetAvailableCharactersAsync(accountId, request, [](const std::vector<CharacterInfo>&\
      \ characters) {\n    for (const auto& character : characters) {\n        std::cout\
      \ << \"Character: \" << character.name << std::endl;\n    }\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations asynchronously and should not be
    called from the main game loop to avoid blocking. The callback function is executed
    on a separate thread, so any UI updates or shared resource access must be properly
    synchronized.
  warnings: Ensure that the accountId parameter corresponds to an actual account in
    the database; otherwise, the operation may return empty results or throw exceptions
    depending on implementation. Avoid calling this method with invalid or uninitialized
    request references as it could lead to undefined behavior.
