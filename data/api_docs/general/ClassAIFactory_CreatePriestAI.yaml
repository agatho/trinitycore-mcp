documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new priest AI instance for a bot character
  description: The CreatePriestAI method is responsible for instantiating a priest-specific
    artificial intelligence behavior for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the appropriate priest-specific
    abilities and spell selection logic, and initializes the AI state machine to handle
    priest-specific gameplay decisions such as healing, damage dealing, and mana management.
    The method typically integrates with the broader bot system to ensure the created
    AI adheres to the configured behavior settings and class-specific mechanics. It
    is commonly used during bot creation or when switching a bot's class to priest.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier or index in
      the system. This parameter specifies which bot instance should have the priest
      AI created and attached to it.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid bot identifier,
    insufficient memory, or failed initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Priest AI Creation
    code: "int botId = 5;\nint result = factory->CreatePriestAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    printf(\"Priest AI created successfully for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n\
      } else {\n    printf(\"Failed to create Priest AI for bot %d with error code:\
      \ %d\\n\", botId, result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Priest AI Creation
    code: "int botIndex = 10;\nint aiResult = factory->CreatePriestAI(&botIndex);\n\
      switch (aiResult) {\n    case 0:\n        // Success - AI created\n        break;\n\
      \    case -1:\n        // Invalid bot index\n        printf(\"Invalid bot index\
      \ provided\\n\");\n        break;\n    case -2:\n        // Memory allocation\
      \ failure\n        printf(\"Failed to allocate memory for priest AI\\n\");\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Other error conditions\n        printf(\"\
      Unknown error occurred during AI creation: %d\\n\", aiResult);\n        break;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's bot AI system and requires that
    the bot system is properly initialized. The created AI instance will automatically
    integrate with the existing bot behavior management system. Developers should
    ensure that the bot identifier passed in the parameter is valid and corresponds
    to an active bot within the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized bot identifier may
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of the bot parameter
    before calling this method. The returned integer value should always be checked
    for error conditions to prevent runtime issues.
