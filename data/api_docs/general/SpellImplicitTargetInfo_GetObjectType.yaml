  method: GetObjectType
  signature: SpellTargetObjectTypes SpellImplicitTargetInfo::GetObjectType() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the object type associated with the spell implicit target information.
  description: The GetObjectType method returns the SpellTargetObjectTypes enumeration
    value that defines the type of object this implicit target refers to. This is
    used in spell targeting systems to determine whether the target is a unit, item,
    game object, or another type of object. The returned value helps the spell system
    properly process targeting logic and validate targets based on the expected object
    type. This method is typically called during spell execution when determining
    valid targets for a given spell's implicit targeting rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpellTargetObjectTypes enumeration value indicating the type of object
    this target information represents. Possible values include TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT,
    TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_ITEM, TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT, and others depending on
    the specific implementation and spell context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Targeting
    code: "SpellImplicitTargetInfo targetInfo;\n// Assume targetInfo has been properly\
      \ initialized with targeting data\nSpellTargetObjectTypes objectType = targetInfo.GetObjectType();\n\
      if (objectType == TARGET_OBJECT_TYPE_UNIT)\n{\n    // Handle unit-based targeting\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell targeting infrastructure in TrinityCore
    and should only be called after the SpellImplicitTargetInfo object has been properly
    initialized with valid targeting data. The returned enumeration value directly
    influences how spell effects are applied to targets.
