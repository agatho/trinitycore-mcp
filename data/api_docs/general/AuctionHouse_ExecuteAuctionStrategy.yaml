  class: AuctionHouse
  method: ExecuteAuctionStrategy
  signature: void AuctionHouse::ExecuteAuctionStrategy(int * player, AuctionStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a specified auction strategy for a given player.
  description: The ExecuteAuctionStrategy method processes and applies a defined auction
    strategy to a player's auction house activities. This method likely handles logic
    such as item pricing, bidding behavior, or auction placement decisions based on
    the provided strategy type. It operates within the context of World of Warcraft's
    auction house system, where players can buy, sell, and manage items through automated
    or scripted behaviors. The method may be used internally by the server to simulate
    player actions or implement AI-driven auction behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier (GUID)
      for whom the auction strategy is executed.
  - name: strategy
    description: An AuctionStrategy enum value that defines the specific behavior
      or logic to be applied during auction execution.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ExecuteAuctionStrategy
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      AuctionStrategy strategy = AUCTION_STRATEGY_BID_HIGH;

      AuctionHouse::ExecuteAuctionStrategy(&playerId, strategy);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal auction house data structures
    and may involve asynchronous operations. Developers should ensure that the player
    ID is valid and the strategy enum value is within expected bounds before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Improper use of the player pointer or invalid strategy values could lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure thread safety when calling this method
    from concurrent contexts.
