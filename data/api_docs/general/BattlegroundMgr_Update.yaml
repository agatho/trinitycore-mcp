documentation:
  brief: Updates the battleground manager's internal state and processes pending battleground
    operations.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the state of all active
    battlegrounds within the game world. It handles time-based updates, player matchmaking,
    battleground lifecycle management, and cleanup of finished matches. This method
    is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals to ensure that
    battlegrounds progress correctly according to their rules and timers. The method
    processes queued operations such as player joins, queue timeouts, and battleground
    start/end conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    sBattlegroundMgr->Update(diff);\n    // ... other update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop with a time
    delta (diff) parameter representing milliseconds since last update. The implementation
    internally manages multiple battleground types and their individual update cycles,
    making it a central point for battleground state management.
