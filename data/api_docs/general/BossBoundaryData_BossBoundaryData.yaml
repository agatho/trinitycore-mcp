  class: BossBoundaryData
  method: BossBoundaryData
  signature: void BossBoundaryData::BossBoundaryData(std::initializer_list<BossBoundaryEntry>
    data)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a BossBoundaryData object with a list of boundary entries for
    boss encounter management.
  description: The BossBoundaryData constructor initializes the boundary data structure
    used in TrinityCore's boss encounter system. This method accepts an initializer
    list of BossBoundaryEntry objects, which define the spatial boundaries and constraints
    for boss encounters. The data is typically used to manage player movement restrictions,
    area triggers, and encounter-specific boundaries during boss fights. The initialization
    process sets up internal structures that track these boundaries for collision
    detection, player positioning, and encounter state management. This constructor
    is usually called when setting up encounter data for a specific boss in the game
    world.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: An initializer list containing BossBoundaryEntry objects that define
      the spatial boundaries and constraints for the boss encounter. Each entry represents
      a boundary segment or area restriction used during the boss fight.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Boundary Initialization
    code: "BossBoundaryData boundaries = {\n    BossBoundaryEntry{100.0f, 200.0f,\
      \ 50.0f},\n    BossBoundaryEntry{150.0f, 250.0f, 75.0f}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Complex Boundary Setup for Multi-Phase Encounter
    code: "BossBoundaryData complexBoundaries = {\n    BossBoundaryEntry{0.0f, 0.0f,\
      \ 100.0f},\n    BossBoundaryEntry{50.0f, 50.0f, 150.0f},\n    BossBoundaryEntry{100.0f,\
      \ 100.0f, 200.0f}\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by the TrinityCore encounter
    system and should not be called directly in most cases. The BossBoundaryEntry
    objects are expected to contain valid spatial coordinates and boundary parameters
    that conform to the game's coordinate system. Performance considerations include
    the number of boundary entries, as more entries may impact collision detection
    efficiency during boss encounters.
  warnings: Improperly configured BossBoundaryEntry data can cause players to become
    stuck or unable to interact with boss encounters properly. Ensure all boundary
    coordinates are within valid ranges and that the boundary definitions make logical
    sense for the encounter design.
