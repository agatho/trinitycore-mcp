  method: GetAuraEffectsByType
  signature: AuraEffectList & Unit::GetAuraEffectsByType(int type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves all aura effects of a specified type from the unit's aura list.
  description: This method returns a reference to a list of aura effects that match
    the specified type. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-side scripting
    and server-side code to access specific aura mechanics such as stat modifiers,
    damage over time effects, or periodic healing. The method allows developers to
    efficiently filter and process aura effects without having to iterate through
    all available auras manually. This functionality is particularly useful when implementing
    custom spell effects or handling complex game mechanics involving multiple aura
    types.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to an AuraEffectList containing all aura effects matching
    the specified type, allowing direct modification of the list elements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "AuraEffectList effects = unit->GetAuraEffectsByType(SPELL_AURA_MOD_STAT);\n\
      for (auto& effect : effects)\n{\n    // Process each stat modifier aura\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: "AuraEffectList effects = unit->GetAuraEffectsByType(SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE);\n\
      if (!effects.empty())\n{\n    // Handle damage over time effects\n    for (auto&\
      \ effect : effects)\n    {\n        // Apply custom logic to each effect\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe when used with proper synchronization. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary iterations through all auras; the
    returned list should be processed efficiently. Implementation details involve
    internal storage of aura effects in a container that supports efficient retrieval
    by type.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying the returned list directly, as changes may
    affect the original aura data. Ensure proper validation of the type parameter
    to avoid unexpected behavior or memory access violations.
