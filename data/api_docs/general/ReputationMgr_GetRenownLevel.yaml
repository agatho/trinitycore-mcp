  class: ReputationMgr

  signature: int32 ReputationMgr::GetRenownLevel(const FactionEntry * renownFactionEntry)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the renown level for a specified faction entry.
  description: The GetRenownLevel method returns the current renown level associated
    with a given faction entry. This functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    reputation system to determine a player's standing with specific factions that
    grant renown. The method takes a const pointer to a FactionEntry object, which
    defines the faction for which the renown level is being queried. It is part of
    the ReputationMgr class and operates on the internal reputation data of the player
    or entity managing the reputations.
  parameters:
  - name: renownFactionEntry
    description: A const pointer to a FactionEntry object representing the faction
      for which the renown level is being retrieved. This parameter must not be null
      and should point to a valid faction entry defined in the game's database.
  returns: An int32 value representing the current renown level for the specified
    faction. The value typically ranges from 0 upwards, where 0 indicates no renown,
    and higher values indicate increased standing with that faction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'const FactionEntry* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1234);

      int32 renownLevel = reputationMgr->GetRenownLevel(faction);

      // renownLevel now contains the current renown for faction ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Renown Level Before Reward
    code: "const FactionEntry* honorFaction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(5678);\nint32\
      \ currentRenown = reputationMgr->GetRenownLevel(honorFaction);\nif (currentRenown\
      \ >= 100) {\n    // Grant reward for reaching renown level 100\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal reputation tracking and assumes that the provided
    FactionEntry is valid and corresponds to a faction with renown mechanics enabled.
    Developers should ensure that the faction entry passed in is not null and exists
    within the game's faction database.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'renownFactionEntry' parameter will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crash the application. Always validate the input
    before calling this method.
