  class: SceneObject
  method: RelocateStationaryPosition
  signature: void SceneObject::RelocateStationaryPosition(const int & pos)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the stationary position of a scene object to the specified location.
  description: The RelocateStationaryPosition method adjusts the fixed positional
    coordinates of a SceneObject within the game world. This method is typically used
    for objects that maintain a static location, such as decorative elements, quest
    markers, or environmental features. The method modifies the object's internal
    position data without triggering movement-related events or updates to connected
    clients. It's important to note that this operation affects only the object's
    stationary positioning and does not influence its dynamic movement state or associated
    animations.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer reference representing the new stationary position index
      or identifier for the scene object. This value typically corresponds to a predefined
      position in the scene's coordinate system or a registered position slot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Relocating a Scene Object to a New Stationary Position
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = ...; // Obtain reference to scene object

      int newPosition = 5;

      sceneObj->RelocateStationaryPosition(newPosition);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on objects that are intended to remain
    stationary. Calling this method on moving objects may result in unexpected behavior
    or visual glitches. The position index should be validated against the scene's
    valid position range to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
  warnings: Modifying a scene object's stationary position after it has been initialized
    might cause client-side desynchronization if not handled properly. Ensure that
    all clients are notified of position changes through appropriate network messages
    when necessary.
