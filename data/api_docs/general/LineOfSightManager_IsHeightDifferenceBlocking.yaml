  class: LineOfSightManager
  method: IsHeightDifferenceBlocking
  signature: bool LineOfSightManager::IsHeightDifferenceBlocking(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a height difference between the caller and target unit
    blocks line of sight.
  description: The IsHeightDifferenceBlocking method evaluates if there is a significant
    vertical distance between the calling Unit and the specified target Unit that
    would prevent line of sight. This function is typically used in game mechanics
    to determine if an object or creature can see another object based on elevation
    differences, such as when checking if a character can see a target that is higher
    or lower than themselves. The method considers various factors including the units'
    positions and their respective heights or bounding boxes to compute whether the
    vertical gap creates an obstruction. It's commonly used in AI pathfinding, targeting
    logic, and visibility checks within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the height difference between the caller and target unit
    blocks line of sight; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if height difference blocks line of sight
    code: "if (player->GetMap()->GetLosManager()->IsHeightDifferenceBlocking(targetUnit))\
      \ {\n    // Line of sight is blocked due to height difference\n    printf(\"\
      Line of sight blocked by height difference.\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Line of\
      \ sight is not blocked\n    printf(\"Line of sight is clear.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on accurate positioning and height data for both units.
    It may be computationally expensive in scenarios with many units, especially when
    used frequently during AI decision-making loops.
