  class: MovementGenerator
  method: UnitSpeedChanged
  signature: void MovementGenerator::UnitSpeedChanged()
documentation:
  brief: Notifies the movement generator that the unit's speed has changed.
  description: The UnitSpeedChanged method is called when a unit's movement speed
    is modified, allowing the movement generator to update its internal state or behavior
    accordingly. This method ensures that any movement-related logic adapts to the
    new speed value, such as recalculating movement paths, adjusting animation speeds,
    or updating AI decision-making based on the changed movement characteristics.
    The method typically serves as a callback in the game's movement system to maintain
    synchronization between unit properties and movement behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in movement update
    code: "void MyMovementGenerator::Update(Unit* unit, uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ...\
      \ movement logic ...\n    if (unit->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_SPEED_CHANGE))\n\
      \    {\n        UnitSpeedChanged();\n        unit->ClearUnitState(UNIT_STATE_SPEED_CHANGE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the core movement system when
    speed changes occur. Developers should not call this directly unless implementing
    custom movement generators that require explicit speed change handling.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method manually in most cases as it's designed to be
    triggered automatically by the game engine when unit speed modifications occur.
    Manual invocation may lead to inconsistent movement states or unexpected behavior.
