  class: GossipHandler
  method: NeedsGossipNavigation
  signature: bool GossipHandler::NeedsGossipNavigation(Creature * creature, InteractionType
    type) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature's gossip interaction requires navigation to
    a specific location.
  description: The NeedsGossipNavigation method evaluates if a given creature's gossip
    interaction type necessitates the player's movement or navigation to a specific
    location within the game world. This typically occurs when the gossip options
    involve quest objectives, vendor locations, or other interactive elements that
    require the player to move to a particular position. The method checks the creature's
    interaction type against predefined conditions to determine if navigation is required
    for proper interaction.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC whose gossip
      interaction is being evaluated
  - name: type
    description: The InteractionType enum value indicating the type of gossip interaction
      being performed
  returns: Returns true if the gossip interaction requires navigation to a specific
    location, false otherwise. This indicates whether the player needs to move to
    a designated position before interacting with the creature's gossip options.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in gossip handler
    code: "if (GossipHandler::NeedsGossipNavigation(creature, InteractionType::QUEST_GIVER))\
      \ {\n    // Player needs to navigate to specific location\n    player->SendMovePlayerToPos(creature->GetPosition());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional navigation check
    code: "bool requiresNav = gossipHandler.NeedsGossipNavigation(targetCreature,\
      \ interactionType);\nif (requiresNav) {\n    // Handle navigation logic\n  \
      \  player->SetGossipNavigationRequired(true);\n} else {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ normal gossip handling\n    player->SendGossipMenuFor(creature);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the GossipHandler's navigation
    system to ensure proper player movement when interacting with NPCs. The implementation
    may vary based on the specific interaction type and creature configuration. Performance-wise,
    this check should be lightweight as it's called frequently during gossip interactions.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Incorrect handling of navigation requirements can lead to players
    being unable to complete quest objectives or interact with NPCs properly.
