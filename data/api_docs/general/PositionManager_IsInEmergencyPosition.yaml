  class: PositionManager
  method: IsInEmergencyPosition
  signature: bool PositionManager::IsInEmergencyPosition()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current position is classified as an emergency position
    within the game world.
  description: The IsInEmergencyPosition method checks if the PositionManager's current
    location meets specific criteria that define an 'emergency position'. In the context
    of TrinityCore and World of Warcraft, emergency positions typically refer to locations
    where certain game mechanics or events are triggered, such as during combat situations,
    respawn points, or special event zones. This method evaluates internal state variables
    or position coordinates against predefined thresholds or flags to make this determination.
    The result is used by various subsystems to adjust behavior, such as disabling
    certain actions, triggering emergency responses, or modifying NPC behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current position is classified as an emergency position;
    otherwise returns false. The exact conditions for what constitutes an 'emergency
    position' are determined by internal logic within the PositionManager class and
    may vary based on game state or configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (positionManager.IsInEmergencyPosition()) {\n    // Handle emergency\
      \ state\n    HandleEmergencyEvent();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Logic
    code: "void Player::UpdatePosition() {\n    if (positionManager.IsInEmergencyPosition())\
      \ {\n        SetFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS, PLAYER_FLAG_EMERGENCY);\n        SendPacketToSelf(CreateEmergencyNotification());\n\
      \    } else {\n        RemoveFlag(PLAYER_FLAGS, PLAYER_FLAG_EMERGENCY);\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may rely on cached position data and should be called after any
    relevant movement or state change. It is recommended to avoid calling this method
    in performance-critical sections without prior optimization, as it may involve
    coordinate comparisons or flag checks that could impact frame rate if used excessively.
  warnings: Do not assume that all positions classified as emergency are safe for
    player interaction. Emergency positions might be temporary or hazardous zones
    where specific game rules apply. Always validate the context in which this method
    is called to prevent unintended behavior.
