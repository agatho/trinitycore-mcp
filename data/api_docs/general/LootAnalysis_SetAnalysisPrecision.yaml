  class: LootAnalysis
  method: SetAnalysisPrecision
  signature: void LootAnalysis::SetAnalysisPrecision(float precision)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the precision level for loot analysis calculations.
  description: The SetAnalysisPrecision method configures the floating-point precision
    used in loot analysis computations within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    allows developers to control how accurately loot values are calculated and compared
    during item distribution processes. The precision value typically affects rounding
    behavior and comparison thresholds when determining loot eligibility or value-based
    distributions. This setting is particularly relevant for custom loot systems or
    when integrating third-party loot analysis modules that require specific numerical
    accuracy.
  parameters:
  - name: precision
    description: A floating-point value representing the desired precision level for
      loot analysis calculations. Higher values indicate more precise calculations,
      while lower values may improve performance but reduce accuracy. Typical valid
      ranges are between 0.001 and 1.0, though exact constraints depend on implementation
      details.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting High Precision for Detailed Loot Analysis
    code: 'LootAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.SetAnalysisPrecision(0.001f); // Sets high precision for detailed calculations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Medium Precision for Performance Optimization
    code: 'LootAnalysis analysis;

      analysis.SetAnalysisPrecision(0.01f); // Balances accuracy with performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely affects internal floating-point comparisons and may influence
    how loot values are rounded during distribution. The precision setting is typically
    applied to all subsequent loot analysis operations until changed again.
  warnings: Setting precision too high may impact performance in systems with many
    concurrent loot operations. Setting it too low could lead to incorrect loot distribution
    decisions due to insufficient accuracy in value comparisons.
