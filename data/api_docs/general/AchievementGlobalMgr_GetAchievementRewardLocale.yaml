    AchievementEntry * achievement) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized reward data for a specific achievement entry.
  description: The GetAchievementRewardLocale method fetches the localized reward
    information associated with a given achievement entry. This includes text and
    other locale-specific data that defines what players receive upon completing the
    achievement. The method is typically used in the context of displaying achievement
    rewards to players in their preferred language or game locale. It accesses internal
    global achievement data structures and returns a pointer to the localized reward
    structure for the specified achievement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an AchievementRewardLocale structure containing the
    localized reward data for the specified achievement. Returns nullptr if the achievement
    entry is invalid or no reward data exists for that achievement.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display Achievement Reward Locale
    code: "const AchievementEntry* entry = sAchievementMgr->GetAchievement(1234);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    const AchievementRewardLocale* rewardLocale = sAchievementGlobalMgr->GetAchievementRewardLocale(entry);\n\
      \    if (rewardLocale)\n    {\n        // Use rewardLocale to display localized\
      \ reward text\n        printf(\"Reward Title: %s\\n\", rewardLocale->Title.c_str());\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup in the global achievement reward locale database.
    It is expected to be called during achievement processing or UI display logic.
    The returned pointer is valid only as long as the AchievementGlobalMgr instance
    remains alive and the achievement data has not been modified.
  warnings: The returned pointer should never be modified directly as it points to
    internal game data structures. Always check for null returns before dereferencing
    the result to avoid access violations.
