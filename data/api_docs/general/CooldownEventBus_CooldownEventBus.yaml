documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new CooldownEventBus instance for managing cooldown-related
    events.
  description: The CooldownEventBus constructor initializes a new instance of the
    cooldown event bus system. This system is responsible for handling and dispatching
    events related to spell and ability cooldowns within the TrinityCore framework.
    It manages the registration, triggering, and processing of cooldown-related notifications
    across different subsystems such as player actions, NPC behavior, and world events.
    The constructor sets up internal data structures necessary for tracking cooldown
    states and event listeners, ensuring that cooldown events are properly propagated
    throughout the game engine.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new CooldownEventBus instance
    code: 'CooldownEventBus cooldownBus;

      // The constructor automatically initializes the event bus for cooldown handling'
    language: cpp
  notes: The CooldownEventBus is typically instantiated as part of the core game system
    initialization and should not be manually constructed in most cases. It's designed
    to be a singleton-like component that manages global cooldown events rather than
    individual cooldown instances.
