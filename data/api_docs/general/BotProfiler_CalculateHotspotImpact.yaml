  class: BotProfiler
  method: CalculateHotspotImpact
  signature: void BotProfiler::CalculateHotspotImpact(PerformanceHotspot & hotspot,
    const ProfilingSession * session)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the impact of a performance hotspot within a profiling session.
  description: The CalculateHotspotImpact method analyzes a given PerformanceHotspot
    object to determine its influence on overall system performance during a specific
    profiling session. This method processes timing data and resource usage metrics
    associated with the hotspot, updating internal statistics that reflect how significantly
    this hotspot contributes to performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies. The calculation
    considers factors such as execution time, frequency of occurrence, and resource
    consumption patterns within the context of the provided profiling session.
  parameters:
  - name: hotspot
    description: Reference to a PerformanceHotspot object that contains timing and
      usage data for analysis. This object is updated with calculated impact metrics
      after processing.
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to a ProfilingSession object containing the complete profiling
      data context. The session provides necessary baseline information and statistical
      references for calculating hotspot impact.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Hotspot Impact Calculation
    code: 'PerformanceHotspot hotspot;

      ProfilingSession session;

      // ... populate hotspot and session data ...

      botProfiler.CalculateHotspotImpact(hotspot, &session);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Multiple Hotspots in a Loop
    code: "std::vector<PerformanceHotspot> hotspots;\nProfilingSession session;\n\
      // ... populate hotspots and session data ...\nfor (auto& hotspot : hotspots)\
      \ {\n    botProfiler.CalculateHotspotImpact(hotspot, &session);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the hotspot parameter in-place by updating its impact
    metrics. It assumes that both the hotspot and session objects contain valid data.
    The calculation is typically performed during post-processing of profiling results
    to identify critical performance bottlenecks.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceHotspot object contains valid timing and usage
    data before calling this method, as invalid data may lead to incorrect impact
    calculations. This method should only be called after a profiling session has
    been completed and all relevant data is available.
