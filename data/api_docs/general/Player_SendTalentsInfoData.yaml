documentation:
  brief: Sends talent information data to the player's client
  description: This method transmits the player's current talent information to their
    client, including talent points and learned talents. It is used internally by
    TrinityCore to synchronize the player's talent state with the game client. The
    method typically triggers a refresh of the talent tree display in the UI, ensuring
    that the player's talent progress is accurately represented. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper game state synchronization during character
    creation, level-up events, or when talents are changed.

  notes: This method is typically called during player initialization or when updating
    talent points. It may be invoked automatically by the core during certain events
    like level-up or when talents are modified. Performance considerations include
    potential network overhead if called frequently, though it's generally lightweight.
