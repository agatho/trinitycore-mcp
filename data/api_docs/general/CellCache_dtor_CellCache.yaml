documentation:
  brief: Destroys the CellCache instance and releases all associated memory resources.
  description: The ~CellCache destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    allocated by the CellCache object. This includes releasing any internal data structures
    that store cached cell information for world objects, such as creatures, game
    objects, and players within a specific grid cell. The destructor ensures proper
    resource deallocation when the CellCache instance goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's world management system, this cleanup
    is essential for maintaining memory efficiency and preventing memory leaks during
    server operation.

  - title: Basic destruction of CellCache instance
    code: 'CellCache* cache = new CellCache();

      // ... use the cache ...

      delete cache; // Triggers ~CellCache destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called when a CellCache object is destroyed.
    It's important to ensure that all references to cached data are properly invalidated
    before destruction to prevent dangling pointers. The destructor does not perform
    any explicit cleanup of external resources beyond its own internal memory management.
