  class: EntryCheckPredicate
  method: EntryCheckPredicate
  signature: void EntryCheckPredicate::EntryCheckPredicate(int entry)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EntryCheckPredicate instance with the specified entry identifier.
  description: The EntryCheckPredicate constructor initializes a predicate object
    used for checking if an entry matches a specific criteria. This class is typically
    used in TrinityCore's database and AI systems to filter or validate entries based
    on their unique identifiers. The method sets up internal state to perform entry
    validation operations, often utilized in quest systems, creature spawning logic,
    or item lookup mechanisms within the game engine.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry) used to initialize the predicate. This
      value typically corresponds to a database entry ID for creatures, items, quests,
      or other game objects in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an EntryCheckPredicate for a creature
    code: 'EntryCheckPredicate predicate(12345);

      // This initializes a predicate to check for creature entry ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using EntryCheckPredicate in a quest validation context
    code: "void ValidateQuestObjective(Player* player, uint32 requiredEntry)\n{\n\
      \    EntryCheckPredicate predicate(requiredEntry);\n    // Use predicate to\
      \ validate if player's current objective matches the entry\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically used internally by TrinityCore's core systems.
    Developers should be aware that the predicate object may be used in performance-critical
    code paths, so it's important to ensure efficient initialization and usage patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that the entry parameter corresponds to a valid database entry
    ID to avoid unexpected behavior during predicate evaluation. Using invalid or
    non-existent entry IDs may lead to undefined behavior in validation logic.
