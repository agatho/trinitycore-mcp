  method: FeedPetIfNeeded
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::FeedPetIfNeeded()
documentation:
  brief: Feeds the hunter's pet if it is hungry and the hunter has sufficient food
    items in their inventory.
  description: The FeedPetIfNeeded method checks whether the hunter's current pet
    is in need of feeding based on its hunger status. If the pet requires food and
    the hunter possesses appropriate food items in their inventory, this method will
    automatically feed the pet. This functionality is part of the Beast Mastery hunter
    specialization's core gameplay mechanics, ensuring that pets remain healthy and
    effective in combat. The method does not require any explicit parameters as it
    operates on the internal state of the hunter and their pet. It is typically invoked
    during regular update cycles or when specific conditions are met within the game
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ...\
      \ other AI logic ...\n    FeedPetIfNeeded();\n    // ... rest of update logic\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal pet hunger state tracking and inventory management.
    It assumes that the hunter object has a valid pet reference and that food items
    are properly categorized in the inventory for pet consumption. Performance-wise,
    this method should be lightweight as it only performs conditional checks without
    heavy computations.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter's pet is not null before calling this method to
    avoid potential crashes. Also, make sure that the pet's hunger state is correctly
    updated by other systems to prevent unnecessary feeding operations or starvation
    conditions.
