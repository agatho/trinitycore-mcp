  class: ObjectGuid
  method: GetMapId
  signature: uint32 ObjectGuid::GetMapId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the map identifier associated with this ObjectGuid.
  description: The GetMapId method extracts and returns the map ID portion from an
    ObjectGuid. In TrinityCore, ObjectGuid is a 64-bit identifier that encodes various
    object-specific information including type, entry, map ID, and counter. This method
    specifically isolates the map ID component which represents the unique identifier
    of the game map where the object resides. The returned value corresponds to the
    Map::GetId() method and can be used to determine which instance or world map an
    object belongs to. This is particularly useful for spatial queries, zone-based
    logic, and ensuring objects are processed within their correct map context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the map identifier associated with this ObjectGuid.
    This corresponds to the unique ID of the Map instance in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345);

      uint32 mapId = guid.GetMapId();

      // Returns the map ID portion of the GUID'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Object Location
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nObjectGuid guid = creature->GetGUID();\nuint32\
      \ currentMapId = guid.GetMapId();\nif (currentMapId == 1234)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ object in specific map\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the internal bit layout of ObjectGuid and assumes
    a standard TrinityCore GUID structure. The map ID is extracted using bit manipulation
    techniques that depend on the HighGuid type. This operation is constant time and
    does not involve any database or memory lookups.
  warnings: This method should only be called on valid ObjectGuid instances. If called
    on an invalid or uninitialized GUID, the behavior may be undefined. Be aware that
    map IDs are not globally unique across different realms or instances.
