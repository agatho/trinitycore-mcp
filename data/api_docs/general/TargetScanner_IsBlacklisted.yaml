  method: IsBlacklisted
  signature: bool TargetScanner::IsBlacklisted(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given GUID is present in the target scanner's blacklist.
  description: The IsBlacklisted method determines whether a specified GameObject
    or Unit GUID is currently marked as blacklisted within the TargetScanner instance.
    This functionality is typically used during AI decision-making processes to avoid
    targeting or interacting with entities that have been explicitly excluded from
    consideration. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure containing
    blacklisted identifiers and returns a boolean result indicating the presence of
    the GUID in that list. It is commonly invoked by AI scripts and combat logic to
    ensure valid target selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified GUID is found in the blacklist; otherwise,
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (targetScanner.IsBlacklisted(targetGuid))\n{\n    // Skip this target\n\
      \    continue;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Preventing Target Selection
    code: "Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_RANDOM, 0, 10.0f);\nif (target\
      \ && !targetScanner.IsBlacklisted(target->GetGUID()))\n{\n    // Proceed with\
      \ attack\n    AttackStart(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal blacklist is maintained by the TargetScanner
    class and may be updated dynamically during runtime. The performance of this lookup
    depends on the implementation of the underlying data structure used to store blacklisted
    GUIDs, typically a hash set or similar efficient container.
