  signature: void GroupCoordination::HandleCriticalHealth(uint32 memberGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles critical health state for a group member by triggering appropriate
    coordination actions.
  description: The HandleCriticalHealth method is responsible for managing the response
    when a group member's health drops to a critical level. This method typically
    initiates emergency procedures such as alerting other group members, initiating
    healing sequences, or invoking special group mechanics designed to prevent player
    death in dangerous situations. It serves as part of the group coordination system
    that maintains player safety and team dynamics during high-risk encounters. The
    method operates on a provided member GUID to identify which specific group member
    requires attention.
  parameters:
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose health has
      reached critical levels. This value must correspond to an active player within
      the current group context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in group coordination
    code: "void MyGroupHandler::OnPlayerCriticalHealth(uint32 playerGuid)\n{\n   \
      \ GroupCoordination coord;\n    coord.HandleCriticalHealth(playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with health check system
    code: "void Player::CheckCriticalHealth()\n{\n    if (GetHealth() <= GetMaxHealth()\
      \ / 10)\n    {\n        Group* group = GetGroup();\n        if (group)\n   \
      \     {\n            GroupCoordination coord;\n            coord.HandleCriticalHealth(GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the game's health monitoring
    system when a player's health falls below a predetermined threshold. It assumes
    that the calling code has already validated that the member is part of a group
    and that the critical state is legitimate. The implementation may trigger additional
    events or callbacks to notify other systems about the critical condition.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without proper group context validation can
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect group coordination responses. Ensure that
    the provided GUID corresponds to an actual group member before calling this method,
    as invalid GUIDs may cause system errors or unexpected behavior in group mechanics.
