  signature: uint32 BotLifecycleMgr::GetMaxConcurrentOperations() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of concurrent bot operations allowed by the lifecycle
    manager.
  description: The GetMaxConcurrentOperations method retrieves the configured limit
    for how many bot lifecycle operations can be executed simultaneously within the
    system. This value is typically used to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain
    server performance when managing large numbers of bots. The returned value represents
    a soft cap that may be enforced by the BotLifecycleMgr to control system load
    and ensure stable operation during high-concurrency scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of concurrent bot operations
    that can be active at any given time. This value is typically configured through
    server settings or runtime parameters and defines the upper bound for parallel
    bot lifecycle management tasks.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve maximum concurrent operations
    code: "uint32 maxOps = botLifecycleMgr->GetMaxConcurrentOperations();\nif (maxOps\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Maximum concurrent bot operations: {}\",\
      \ maxOps);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during system initialization or configuration
    validation. The value returned may be dynamically adjusted based on server load
    or configuration changes, though it's generally expected to remain stable during
    normal operation.
