documentation:
  brief: Destroys a PlayerDump object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~PlayerDump destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of a PlayerDump instance. This method
    ensures proper deallocation of internal data structures that store player character
    information, including inventory items, spell lists, quest progress, and other
    character state data. The destructor is automatically invoked when a PlayerDump
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It performs cleanup operations
    necessary to prevent memory leaks and maintain the integrity of the TrinityCore
    server's memory management system.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'PlayerDump* dump = new PlayerDump();

      // ... use the dump object ...

      delete dump; // Triggers ~PlayerDump() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when a PlayerDump
    object is destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless
    explicitly managing object lifetime in custom memory allocation scenarios.
