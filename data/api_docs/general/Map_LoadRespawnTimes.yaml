documentation:
  brief: Loads respawn times for all game objects and creatures in the map
  description: This method initializes and loads the respawn time data for all game
    objects and creatures present in the current map instance. It retrieves stored
    respawn information from the database and populates the internal respawn timer
    structures, ensuring that objects are correctly respawned according to their configured
    respawn times. The method is typically called during map initialization and handles
    the synchronization of respawn states with the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Map* map = new Map();

      map->LoadRespawnTimes();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per map instance during initialization.
    It involves database queries and can impact performance if many objects are present
    in the map. Thread safety is not guaranteed for this method.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method may cause incorrect respawn behavior, leading
    to objects never respawning or respawning too frequently. Ensure that this method
    is called only once per map instance.
