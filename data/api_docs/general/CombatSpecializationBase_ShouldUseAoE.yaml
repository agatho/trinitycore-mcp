  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::ShouldUseAoE() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat specialization should use area-of-effect abilities.
  description: The ShouldUseAoE method evaluates the current combat state and specialization
    rules to determine if area-of-effect abilities are appropriate for the current
    situation. This method is typically used by AI-controlled entities to make tactical
    decisions about when to employ AoE spells or abilities. The decision is based
    on factors such as target count, threat level, and specialization-specific logic.
    It returns true when AoE tactics should be employed, and false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether area-of-effect abilities should be used.
    Returns true if AoE tactics are recommended for the current combat scenario, false
    if single-target or other tactics are preferred.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->ShouldUseAoE()) {\n    // Cast an\
      \ AoE spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_AOE_DAMAGE, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Cast a single-target spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SINGLE_TARGET_DAMAGE,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the combat specialization system in TrinityCore and
    integrates with the AI decision-making framework. The implementation may consider
    factors such as number of nearby enemies, health percentages, and spell cooldowns
    to make tactical decisions.
