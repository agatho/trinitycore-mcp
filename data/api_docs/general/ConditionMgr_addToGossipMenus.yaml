  class: ConditionMgr
  method: addToGossipMenus
  signature: void ConditionMgr::addToGossipMenus(const ConditionId & id, int conditions)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Adds a condition to the gossip menu system for use in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore server.
  description: The addToGossipMenus method registers a condition with the gossip menu
    system, allowing conditional display of gossip options based on specified criteria.
    This method integrates with the ConditionMgr class which manages all game conditions
    used throughout the TrinityCore framework. The method takes a ConditionId and
    an integer representing condition types or flags, and stores this information
    within the internal gossip menu condition registry. It is typically invoked during
    server initialization or when loading custom NPC gossip data to ensure that conditional
    logic is properly applied to in-game dialogue options.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for the condition being added, typically representing
      a specific condition type or group within the game's condition system.
  - name: conditions
    description: An integer value representing the condition flags or types that define
      how the condition should be evaluated when determining gossip menu visibility.
      This may include bitwise combinations of various condition types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: ConditionMgr::getInstance()->addToGossipMenus(ConditionId(12345), 1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Conditions
    code: 'ConditionMgr* mgr = ConditionMgr::getInstance();

      mgr->addToGossipMenus(ConditionId(1001), CONDITION_IN_INSTANCE);

      mgr->addToGossipMenus(ConditionId(1002), CONDITION_NOT_IN_INSTANCE | CONDITION_HAS_ITEM);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or when loading NPC
    data to ensure that all conditions are properly registered before gameplay begins.
    The ConditionId parameter must be unique within the context of the gossip menu
    system, and the conditions parameter should reflect valid condition flags defined
    in the TrinityCore codebase.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect conditional logic
    for NPC gossip menus. Ensure that ConditionId values are unique and that condition
    flags are properly defined to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior in game
    dialogue systems.
