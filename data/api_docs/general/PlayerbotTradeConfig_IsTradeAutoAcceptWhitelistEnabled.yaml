  method: IsTradeAutoAcceptWhitelistEnabled
  signature: bool PlayerbotTradeConfig::IsTradeAutoAcceptWhitelistEnabled()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the trade auto-accept whitelist feature is enabled for
    player bots.
  description: This method checks if the trade auto-accept whitelist functionality
    is active within the PlayerbotTradeConfig. When enabled, player bots will only
    auto-accept trade requests from players who are explicitly listed in the whitelist.
    This feature helps prevent unwanted trades while still allowing controlled interactions
    with trusted players. The configuration is typically managed through the TrinityCore
    playerbot system settings and may be toggled based on user preferences or server
    rules.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the trade auto-accept whitelist is enabled, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if whitelist is enabled before processing a trade
    code: "if (playerBot->GetTradeConfig()->IsTradeAutoAcceptWhitelistEnabled()) {\n\
      \    // Only accept trades from whitelisted players\n    // Implementation logic\
      \ here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the playerbot trade configuration system and should
    be called frequently during trade processing to ensure proper behavior. The whitelist
    itself is managed separately through other configuration methods or database entries.
