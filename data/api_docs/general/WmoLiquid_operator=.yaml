documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of another WmoLiquid object to this object
  description: The assignment operator for the WmoLiquid class copies all member data
    from the provided source object to the current object. This operation performs
    a deep copy of the liquid data associated with a World Map Object (WMO) section,
    ensuring that both objects contain identical liquid information. The method is
    typically used when duplicating or replacing liquid data structures in memory,
    such as during map loading or when modifying WMO liquid properties at runtime.
    It returns a reference to the current object to allow for chaining of assignment
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current WmoLiquid object after the assignment has been
    completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'WmoLiquid liquid1;

      WmoLiquid liquid2;

      // ... initialize liquid1 with data ...

      liquid2 = liquid1; // Assigns all data from liquid1 to liquid2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'WmoLiquid liquid1, liquid2, liquid3;

      // ... initialize data ...

      liquid3 = liquid2 = liquid1; // Chained assignment

      // Both liquid2 and liquid3 now contain the same data as liquid1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely handles memory management internally to ensure proper
    copying of dynamic data structures. In TrinityCore's context, WmoLiquid objects
    represent liquid data for WMO sections, which may involve complex data such as
    vertex positions, liquid types, and height information.
