  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleAuraTransform(const AuraApplication * aurApp,
    uint8 mode, bool apply) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes a visual transformation aura effect on the target.
  description: The HandleAuraTransform method manages the application and removal
    of transformation auras, which alter the visual appearance of a unit. This method
    is invoked during aura application or removal to update the unit's model, scale,
    or other visual properties. It interacts with the AuraApplication object to determine
    the specific transformation parameters and applies them based on the mode and
    apply flags. The method ensures that transformations are correctly synchronized
    with the game state and that any associated visual effects are properly handled.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object containing information about
      the aura being applied or removed. This parameter determines the transformation
      parameters and target unit.
  - name: mode
    description: Specifies the operation mode for the transformation. Valid values
      typically include 0 for application, 1 for removal, and possibly additional
      modes for specific transformation types.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the transformation effect. When true, the unit's appearance is modified; when
      false, it reverts to normal state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Transformation Application
    code: "void ApplyTransformation(AuraApplication* app, uint8 mode) {\n    AuraEffect*\
      \ effect = new AuraEffect();\n    effect->HandleAuraTransform(app, mode, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing Transformation Effect
    code: "void RemoveTransformation(AuraApplication* app, uint8 mode) {\n    AuraEffect*\
      \ effect = new AuraEffect();\n    effect->HandleAuraTransform(app, mode, false);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the aura handling system and should only be called
    during aura application or removal events. The transformation effects are typically
    managed through the unit's visual state system and may involve updates to model,
    scale, and other appearance attributes.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can result in incorrect visual states or client-server
    desynchronization. Ensure that the AuraApplication object is valid and properly
    initialized before calling this method.
