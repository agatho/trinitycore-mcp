  signature: uint32 HavocDemonHunterRefactored::GetSpellResourceCost(uint32 spellId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the resource cost of a specified spell for the Havoc Demon Hunter
    class.
  description: This method fetches the resource cost associated with a given spell
    ID for the Havoc Demon Hunter specialization. It is typically used to determine
    how much Fury, Soul Shards, or other resources are required to cast a specific
    ability. The method performs a lookup in the spell resource cost database or cache
    and returns the corresponding value. This functionality is essential for gameplay
    mechanics such as spell validation, resource management, and UI display of spell
    costs.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the resource cost of the specified
    spell. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the spell does not consume
    any resources or that the spell ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get Resource Cost for Fel Rush
    code: "uint32 cost = demonHunter->GetSpellResourceCost(195072); // Fel Rush\n\
      if (cost > 0)\n{\n    // Use the cost value to determine if player can cast\
      \ the spell\n    std::cout << \"Fel Rush costs \" << cost << \" fury.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the spell ID provided is valid for the Havoc Demon
    Hunter class. The actual resource cost may vary based on buffs, talents, or other
    gameplay modifiers not reflected in this basic lookup.
