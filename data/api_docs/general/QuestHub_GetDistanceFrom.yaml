  class: QuestHub
  method: GetDistanceFrom
  signature: float QuestHub::GetDistanceFrom(const Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the Euclidean distance from the specified player to
    the QuestHub object.
  description: The GetDistanceFrom method computes the three-dimensional Euclidean
    distance between the current QuestHub instance and a given Player object. This
    calculation takes into account the X, Y, and Z coordinates of both entities in
    the game world. The method is typically used for proximity checks, determining
    whether a player is within range of a quest hub for interaction or quest acceptance.
    It performs a standard distance calculation using the formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 +
    (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2). The result is returned as a floating-point value representing
    the distance in game units. This method does not perform any validation on the
    input player pointer, so it's assumed that the caller has ensured the pointer
    is valid and points to an active player object.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A const pointer to the Player object for which the distance to this
      QuestHub is calculated. Must be a valid, non-null pointer to an active player
      in the game world.
  returns: A float value representing the Euclidean distance between the QuestHub
    and the specified player in game units. Returns a positive floating-point number
    indicating the straight-line distance; returns 0.0f if the player and QuestHub
    are at the exact same location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Distance Check
    code: "float distance = questHub->GetDistanceFrom(player);\nif (distance < 5.0f)\
      \ {\n    // Player is close enough to interact with the quest hub\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Distance for Quest Acceptance Logic
    code: "float distance = questHub->GetDistanceFrom(player);\nif (distance <= 10.0f\
      \ && player->GetQuestStatus(QUEST_ID) == QUEST_STATUS_NONE) {\n    // Player\
      \ is within range to accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest, questHub);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple Euclidean distance calculation and does not
    account for terrain height differences or obstacles in the game world. It's primarily
    used for basic proximity detection rather than pathfinding or line-of-sight checks.
    The method assumes that both the QuestHub and Player objects have valid position
    data. Performance-wise, this is a lightweight operation suitable for frequent
    calls in game logic loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is not null before
    calling to avoid undefined behavior. This method does not validate whether the
    player is within the same map or instance as the QuestHub, which could lead to
    incorrect distance calculations if used across different zones or instances.
