  brief: Returns the position of the item within the player's inventory.
  description: The GetPos method retrieves the slot position of an item in the player's
    inventory, which is essential for identifying where the item is located. This
    method is commonly used in game mechanics to determine item placement and can
    be crucial for various operations such as item management, equipment updates,
    or inventory checks. The returned value represents the index of the item within
    the inventory container, typically ranging from 0 to 119 for normal player inventories.

  returns: Returns a uint16 representing the slot position of the item in the player's
    inventory. This value indicates where the item is located within the inventory,
    with values ranging from 0 to 119 corresponding to different inventory slots.
    A return value of 0 typically represents the first slot in the inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(ITEM_SLOT_BAG_1, 0);

      uint16 pos = item->GetPos();

      // pos will be 0 if item is in the first slot'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not require any special considerations
    for implementation. It's important to note that the returned position value may
    vary depending on the inventory type being accessed, such as bags or backpacks.
