  class: KitingManager
  method: FindSafeKitingDirection
  signature: int KitingManager::FindSafeKitingDirection(const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the safest kiting direction based on threat assessment.
  description: The FindSafeKitingDirection method evaluates the current threat landscape
    to determine the optimal direction for a unit to kite (move while maintaining
    distance from enemies). It analyzes the threat levels from various directions
    and selects the path that minimizes risk. This method is typically used in AI
    behavior for units that need to maintain distance from multiple attackers while
    continuing to engage or move strategically. The method assumes that threats are
    represented as directional values, with higher values indicating greater danger.
    The return value represents a direction vector or angle that should be used for
    movement.
  parameters:
  - name: threats
    description: An integer representing the threat level from all directions. This
      parameter is expected to contain aggregated threat data, possibly from multiple
      sources, and may represent a normalized or weighted value indicating danger
      levels in different directions.
  returns: Returns an integer that represents the safest kiting direction. The value
    typically corresponds to a directional angle or vector component, where positive
    values indicate clockwise rotation and negative values indicate counter-clockwise
    rotation from a reference direction. A return value of zero may indicate no clear
    threat or neutral direction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI movement logic
    code: "int safeDirection = kitingManager.FindSafeKitingDirection(currentThreats);\n\
      if (safeDirection != 0) {\n    unit->MoveInDirection(safeDirection);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with threat management system
    code: "int threats = threatManager.GetAggregateThreatLevel();\nint safeDir = kitingManager.FindSafeKitingDirection(threats);\n\
      if (safeDir > 0) {\n    // Move clockwise\n    unit->SetFacing(safeDir);\n}\
      \ else if (safeDir < 0) {\n    // Move counter-clockwise\n    unit->SetFacing(-safeDir);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger kiting AI system and requires accurate threat
    assessment data to function properly. The 'threats' parameter should be updated
    regularly to reflect current conditions. Performance may be impacted if threat
    calculations are not optimized, especially in high-density combat scenarios.
  warnings: The method assumes that the input threats value is correctly calculated
    and normalized. Incorrect or outdated threat data can lead to poor kiting decisions,
    potentially resulting in unit death or inefficient movement patterns. Ensure that
    this method is called only when sufficient threat information is available.
