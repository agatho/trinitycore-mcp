documentation:
  brief: Sets the backpack sell junk disabled flag for the player's session.
  description: This method handles the client packet that informs the server whether
    the player has disabled the automatic selling of junk items in their backpack.
    When enabled, it prevents the automatic sale of low-value items during certain
    operations such as looting or vendor interactions. The setting is stored per session
    and affects the behavior of the player's inventory management system within the
    game world. This method typically processes user interface settings changes related
    to inventory cleanup preferences.
  parameters:
  - name: setBackpackSellJunkDisabled
    description: A packet containing the state of the backpack sell junk disabled
      flag sent from the client.
