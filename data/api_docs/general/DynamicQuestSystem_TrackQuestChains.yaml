documentation:
  brief: Tracks active quest chains for the specified player bot.
  description: The TrackQuestChains method monitors and maintains a record of all
    active quest chains assigned to a player bot within the Dynamic Quest System.
    This functionality ensures that quest progression is properly tracked across related
    quests, allowing for intelligent quest management and chain completion detection.
    The method typically updates internal data structures that store quest chain information,
    including dependencies, prerequisites, and current progress status for each active
    chain.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Get reference to player bot

      DynamicQuestSystem::TrackQuestChains(bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest update cycles or when a bot's
    quest state changes. It may internally iterate through all active quests for the
    player and evaluate their chain relationships to determine which chains are currently
    active.
