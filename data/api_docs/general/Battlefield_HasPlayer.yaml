  signature: bool Battlefield::HasPlayer(Player * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a specific player is registered in the battlefield.
  description: The HasPlayer method determines if a given Player object is currently
    associated with or registered in the Battlefield instance. This is typically used
    to verify a player's presence within a battlefield zone before performing operations
    such as updating their status, granting rewards, or handling combat interactions.
    The method performs a lookup in the internal list of players participating in
    the battlefield and returns true if the player is found, false otherwise. It does
    not validate if the player is still alive or active in the battlefield, only that
    they have been registered.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is registered in the battlefield,
    false if not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Player Registration
    code: "if (battlefield->HasPlayer(player)) {\n    // Player is registered in the\
      \ battlefield\n    SendBattlefieldStatusUpdate(player);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ is not registered\n    player->SendNotification(\"You are not in this battlefield.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using HasPlayer Before Granting Rewards
    code: "if (battlefield->HasPlayer(player) && player->IsInBattlefield()) {\n  \
      \  // Award victory points or loot\n    player->AddItem(ITEM_ID_VICTORY_CROWN,\
      \ 1);\n    player->ModifyArenaPoints(50);\n} else {\n    // Player not eligible\
      \ for rewards\n    player->SendNotification(\"You must be in the battlefield\
      \ to receive rewards.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of players within the battlefield
    and assumes that player registration is handled by the Battlefield system. It
    does not perform any network synchronization or state validation beyond checking
    the local registry. The method is generally fast but may involve locking mechanisms
    depending on how the internal player list is managed.
  warnings: Do not assume that a player returned as 'true' by this method is still
    actively participating in combat or has not left the battlefield. This check only
    confirms registration, not current engagement status.
