documentation:
  brief: Stops the leader offline timer for the group, preventing automatic disbanding
    when the leader goes offline.
  description: The StopLeaderOfflineTimer method halts the countdown timer that would
    otherwise cause a group to be automatically disbanded if the group leader goes
    offline. This functionality is typically used to prevent accidental group dissolution
    during legitimate offline periods, such as when a player logs out or experiences
    temporary network disconnection. The method does not immediately disbanded the
    group; it simply cancels the pending disband action. It is commonly called when
    the group leader returns online or when a new leader is assigned to maintain group
    stability.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Stopping Leader Offline Timer When Leader Returns
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(Player* player)\n{\n    if (Group* group = player->GetGroup())\n\
      \    {\n        // Stop the leader offline timer when the leader logs back in\n\
      \        group->StopLeaderOfflineTimer();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the group management system and interacts with internal
    timers. It should be called carefully to avoid interfering with legitimate group
    disbanding logic. The timer is typically started when a group leader goes offline,
    and this method cancels that specific timer.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the group state may lead to unexpected
    behavior if the group is already in an invalid state. Ensure that the group exists
    and the player is actually the leader before calling this method.
