documentation:
  brief: Updates the list of targets affected by the area trigger.
  description: The UpdateTargetList method is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date
    list of GameObjects and Players currently within the area trigger's bounds. This
    method is typically called during the area trigger's update cycle to ensure that
    all affected entities are properly tracked. It evaluates the current position
    of the area trigger against the positions of nearby objects and updates internal
    target lists accordingly. The method plays a crucial role in determining which
    entities should be affected by the area trigger's effects, such as spell impacts
    or environmental interactions.

  - title: Basic Usage in Area Trigger Update
    code: "void AreaTrigger::Update()\n{\n    // Update the area trigger's position\
      \ and other properties\n    UpdateTargetList();\n    // Process effects on targets\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during the area trigger's
    update loop. It performs spatial queries to determine which entities are currently
    within the trigger's boundaries and updates internal target lists accordingly.
    The performance of this method can be impacted by the number of nearby objects
    and the complexity of the area trigger's shape.
