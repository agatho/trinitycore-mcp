api:
  class: BotScheduler
  method: RegisterPattern
  signature: void BotScheduler::RegisterPattern(const std::string & name, const ActivityPattern
    & pattern)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a new activity pattern with the bot scheduler by name for use in
    automated behavior execution.
  description: The RegisterPattern method allows developers to register custom activity
    patterns that define sequences of actions bots can perform. These patterns are
    stored internally within the BotScheduler and can be referenced later by name
    during bot behavior initialization or runtime. The method takes a unique pattern
    name and an ActivityPattern object which contains the sequence of activities to
    be executed. This enables modular and reusable bot behavior definitions, supporting
    complex AI-driven operations such as quest completion, resource gathering, or
    combat routines. Patterns registered via this method become available for assignment
    to specific bots through other scheduler APIs.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A unique string identifier for the pattern being registered. This
      name is used later to reference and apply the pattern to bots.
  - name: pattern
    description: An ActivityPattern object containing the sequence of activities that
      define the behavior to be executed when this pattern is invoked.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pattern Registration
    code: 'ActivityPattern gatherPattern;

      // Add activities to gatherPattern...

      globalBotScheduler->RegisterPattern("GatherResources", gatherPattern);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering Multiple Patterns
    code: 'ActivityPattern combatPattern;

      ActivityPattern idlePattern;

      // Configure patterns with appropriate activities...

      globalBotScheduler->RegisterPattern("CombatRoutine", combatPattern);

      globalBotScheduler->RegisterPattern("IdleBehavior", idlePattern);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The pattern name must be unique; registering a pattern with an existing name
    will overwrite the previous definition. The ActivityPattern object should contain
    valid activity definitions that are compatible with the bot's current context
    and capabilities.
  warnings: Overwriting existing patterns with RegisterPattern can lead to unexpected
    behavior if other parts of the codebase depend on the original pattern definition.
    Ensure all references to overwritten patterns are updated accordingly.
