  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ~ThreatCoordinator
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::~ThreatCoordinator()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ThreatCoordinator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The ~ThreatCoordinator destructor is called automatically when a ThreatCoordinator
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal data structures, memory allocations, and references held
    by the threat coordination system. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    this typically involves releasing threat lists, clearing creature AI state, and
    ensuring no dangling pointers remain. The destructor is essential for maintaining
    memory safety and preventing resource leaks in combat-related systems.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of ThreatCoordinator
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    ThreatCoordinator coordinator;\n    // ...\
      \ use coordinator ...\n    // destructor called automatically when coordinator\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of ThreatCoordinator
    code: 'ThreatCoordinator* coordinator = new ThreatCoordinator();

      // ... use coordinator ...

      delete coordinator; // Calls ~ThreatCoordinator destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call this
    destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process may involve cleanup of threat lists, AI state tracking, and other internal
    structures used for managing mob aggro behavior.
