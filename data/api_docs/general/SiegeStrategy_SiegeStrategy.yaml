  method: SiegeStrategy
  signature: void SiegeStrategy::SiegeStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new siege strategy instance for handling siege mechanics in
    World of Warcraft.
  description: The SiegeStrategy constructor initializes a new instance of the SiegeStrategy
    class, which is responsible for managing various aspects of siege warfare within
    the TrinityCore framework. This includes handling siege weapon behavior, destruction
    mechanics, and interaction with siege-related game objects such as catapults,
    ballistae, and doors. The method sets up internal state variables and registers
    necessary event handlers to ensure proper functioning during siege scenarios.
    It is typically invoked when a new siege encounter is initiated or when a siege
    object needs to be configured for gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SiegeStrategy instance
    code: 'SiegeStrategy* strategy = new SiegeStrategy();

      // The constructor automatically initializes all necessary components

      // for handling siege mechanics in the current game context.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the core framework when
    a siege encounter begins. Developers should not directly instantiate SiegeStrategy
    objects unless implementing custom siege logic. The class relies on TrinityCore's
    event system and may require additional setup through the AI or GameObject systems
    to function properly.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of SiegeStrategy outside of the core framework may
    lead to undefined behavior if not properly integrated with the existing siege
    management systems. Ensure that all required dependencies are initialized before
    using any siege-related functionality.
