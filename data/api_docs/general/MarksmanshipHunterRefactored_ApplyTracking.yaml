  method: ApplyTracking
  signature: void MarksmanshipHunterRefactored::ApplyTracking(uint32 param0)
documentation:
  brief: Applies tracking effects to the marksmanship hunter's current target.
  description: The ApplyTracking method is responsible for activating and applying
    tracking mechanics specific to the Marksmanship Hunter class. This method typically
    manages the application of tracking buffs or debuffs that enhance the hunter's
    ability to maintain focus on a target, often used in conjunction with abilities
    like Aimed Shot or Trueshot Aura. It may also handle updating internal state variables
    related to tracking duration, effectiveness, or cooldowns. The method operates
    on the hunter's current target and modifies their combat behavior or status effects.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An unsigned 32-bit integer parameter that likely represents a tracking
      type identifier, effect index, or target ID. Valid values depend on the specific
      implementation but typically correspond to predefined tracking mechanics within
      the Marksmanship Hunter's ability set.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of ApplyTracking
    code: 'MarksmanshipHunterRefactored* hunter = ...;

      hunter->ApplyTracking(1); // Applies tracking effect with ID 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Tracking Based on Target Type
    code: "MarksmanshipHunterRefactored* hunter = ...;\nUnit* target = hunter->GetVictim();\n\
      if (target && target->IsCreature()) {\n    uint32 trackingType = target->GetEntry()\
      \ == 12345 ? 2 : 1; // Different tracking for different creatures\n    hunter->ApplyTracking(trackingType);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the hunter's AI state machine and may trigger
    updates to the target's combat status. It should be called only when a valid target
    exists to avoid unintended behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid target or with an invalid tracking
    type parameter may result in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure that
    the hunter has an active target before invoking this method.
