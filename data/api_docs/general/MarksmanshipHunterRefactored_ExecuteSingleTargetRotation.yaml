    target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the marksmanship hunter's single-target rotation logic for the specified
    target.
  description: The ExecuteSingleTargetRotation method implements the core single-target
    combat rotation for a marksmanship hunter class. This method determines the optimal
    sequence of abilities and spells to cast against a single enemy target based on
    current game state, resource levels, and tactical considerations. It typically
    involves managing focus generation, applying damage-over-time effects, and utilizing
    key abilities such as Aimed Shot, Steady Shot, and Trueshot Aura. The method is
    designed to be called during combat situations where the hunter has a primary
    target and aims to maximize damage output or efficiency.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or index
      in the game world. This parameter specifies which enemy unit the rotation should
      be executed against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      this->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State
    code: "if (player->IsInCombat()) {\n    int targetGuid = player->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    this->ExecuteSingleTargetRotation(&targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the hunter is in combat and has a valid target.
    It does not perform any validation on the target parameter, so it's expected that
    the caller ensures the target exists and is valid before invoking this method.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes if the target is invalid or non-existent. Ensure proper target validation
    before calling this method.
