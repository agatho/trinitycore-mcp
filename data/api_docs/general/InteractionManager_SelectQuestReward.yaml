api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: SelectQuestReward
  signature: uint32 InteractionManager::SelectQuestReward(Player * bot, const Quest
    * quest) const
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns the reward ID for a quest based on the bot player's selection.
  description: The SelectQuestReward method determines which reward option the specified
    bot player has selected for a given quest. This method is typically invoked during
    quest completion to identify the chosen reward from multiple available options.
    It evaluates the player's current quest state and selected reward choice, returning
    the unique identifier of the chosen reward item or currency. The method plays
    a crucial role in the quest reward selection process within the TrinityCore framework,
    ensuring proper reward distribution according to player choices.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character that
      is selecting a quest reward.
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object for which the reward selection is being
      made.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the ID of the selected quest reward.
    This ID typically corresponds to an entry in the quest_reward table or related
    reward data structure within the TrinityCore database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Reward Selection
    code: "uint32 rewardId = interactionManager.SelectQuestReward(botPlayer, quest);\n\
      if (rewardId > 0)\n{\n    // Process the selected reward\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      player.quest\", \"Selected reward ID: %u\", rewardId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Selected Reward in Quest Completion
    code: "const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* bot\
      \ = ...; // Bot player instance\nuint32 selectedReward = interactionManager.SelectQuestReward(bot,\
      \ quest);\nif (selectedReward > 0)\n{\n    // Award the selected reward to the\
      \ player\n    bot->AddItem(selectedReward, 1);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest state tracking and may depend
    on the player's current quest log entries. It assumes that the player has already
    made a reward selection for the specified quest. The method is part of the interaction
    handling system and should be called after quest completion checks have been performed.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot player and quest parameters are valid and not
    null before calling this method, as invalid pointers may lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes. This method should only be called when the quest is in a state where
    reward selection is possible.
