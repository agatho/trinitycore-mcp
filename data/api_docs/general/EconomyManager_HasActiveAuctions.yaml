  signature: bool EconomyManager::HasActiveAuctions() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the economy manager has any active auctions.
  description: The HasActiveAuctions method determines if there are currently any
    active auctions within the economy system. This is typically used to verify the
    presence of ongoing auction activities before performing operations that depend
    on active auction data. The method performs a quick check against internal auction
    lists or counters to determine the state without triggering expensive database
    queries. It's commonly used in auction house functionality, player notifications,
    and economy-related game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are active auctions present in the economy system;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether any auction items are currently
    listed for sale or in the process of being sold.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (economyManager.HasActiveAuctions()) {\n    // Proceed with auction-related\
      \ operations\n    printf(\"Active auctions found.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"\
      No active auctions currently.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Auction House Logic
    code: "void UpdateAuctionHouseUI() {\n    if (economyManager.HasActiveAuctions())\
      \ {\n        // Enable auction-related UI elements\n        ShowAuctionList();\n\
      \        EnableBidButton();\n    } else {\n        // Disable or hide auction\
      \ UI elements\n        HideAuctionList();\n        DisableBidButton();\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it suitable for
    frequent checks in game loops or UI updates. It likely uses cached data rather
    than querying the database directly, which improves performance in high-frequency
    scenarios.
  warnings: Be aware that this method may return outdated information if auction states
    change frequently. For real-time accuracy, consider using additional synchronization
    mechanisms or polling strategies when dealing with critical auction operations.
