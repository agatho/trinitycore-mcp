  class: Player
  method: GetQuestSlotState
  signature: uint32 Player::GetQuestSlotState(uint16 slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest slot state for a specified quest slot.
  description: This method retrieves the current state of a specific quest slot from
    the player's quest log. The quest slot is identified by a uint16 value representing
    the slot index, and the returned uint32 value indicates the status of that quest
    slot. This method is commonly used to check if a quest has been completed or if
    it's still active in the player's quest log. It provides information about quest
    progress, completion status, and whether the quest is available for acceptance
    or already accepted.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a uint32 value representing the quest slot state. Possible values
    include: 0 (no quest in slot), 1 (quest active but not completed), 2 (quest completed),
    3 (quest failed), and other values depending on the specific quest state and game
    mechanics.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 questState = player->GetQuestSlotState(10);\nif (questState == 2)\n\
      {\n    // Quest is completed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the overall quest status. It's important to note that the slot parameter
    represents a specific quest slot index, which may vary between different players
    based on their quest log and available slots.
  warnings: The method returns 0 when no quest exists in the specified slot, which
    can be confused with a 'not found' scenario. Care should be taken to distinguish
    between empty slots and actual quest completion states.
