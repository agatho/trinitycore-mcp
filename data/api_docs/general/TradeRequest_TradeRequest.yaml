documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new trade request object for handling player trading operations
    in the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The TradeRequest constructor initializes a new trade request instance,
    setting up the necessary internal state for managing item exchanges between players.
    This method is typically invoked when a player initiates a trade with another
    player, establishing the foundation for the entire trading process. The constructor
    prepares the trade request object to handle bidirectional item transfers, currency
    adjustments, and validation checks required during the trading session. It ensures
    that all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized before
    the trade can proceed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new trade request
    code: 'TradeRequest* trade = new TradeRequest();

      // The trade object is now ready to handle player trading operations'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the core trading system and should only be called
    when initiating a new trade session. The object must be properly managed and destroyed
    after use to prevent memory leaks.
