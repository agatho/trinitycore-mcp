  class: BotGearFactory
  method: IsItemAppropriate
  signature: bool BotGearFactory::IsItemAppropriate(const CachedItem & item, uint8
    cls, uint32 specId, uint32 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a cached item is appropriate for a bot based on class,
    specialization, and level constraints.
  description: The IsItemAppropriate method evaluates if a given cached item meets
    the requirements for usage by a bot character. It checks whether the item's class,
    specialization, and level are compatible with the bot's configuration. This ensures
    that bots only equip items that align with their role, class restrictions, and
    progression level within the game. The method is typically used during gear selection
    and inventory management processes in bot AI systems.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: A reference to a CachedItem object representing the item being evaluated
      for appropriateness.
  - name: cls
    description: The class ID of the bot character (e.g., Warrior = 1, Paladin = 2,
      etc.). Used to validate class-specific item restrictions.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID of the bot character. Allows for more granular
      filtering based on talent builds or roles.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot character. Ensures that items meet minimum level
      requirements for the bot's progression.
  returns: Returns true if the item is appropriate for the specified class, specialization,
    and level; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an item is suitable for a warrior bot
    code: "CachedItem item;\n// Assume item is populated with data\nbool result =\
      \ factory.IsItemAppropriate(item, CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_WARRIOR_FURY, 60);\nif\
      \ (result) {\n    // Proceed with equipping the item\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage in a bot gear selection context
    code: "for (auto& item : availableItems) {\n    if (factory.IsItemAppropriate(item,\
      \ botClass, botSpec, botLevel)) {\n        // Add to list of usable items\n\
      \        suitableItems.push_back(item);\n    }\n}\n// Use suitableItems for\
      \ further processing"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against item class restrictions, level
    requirements, and specialization-specific filters. It may also consider item type
    (weapon, armor, etc.) and slot compatibility. The CachedItem structure is expected
    to contain sufficient metadata for these evaluations.
  warnings: Ensure that the parameters passed to this method are valid; invalid class
    or spec IDs could lead to incorrect filtering results. Be cautious when using
    this in performance-critical code paths due to potential iteration over item collections.
