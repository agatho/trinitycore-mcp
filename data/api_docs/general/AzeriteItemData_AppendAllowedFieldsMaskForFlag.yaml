  class: AzeriteItemData
  method: AppendAllowedFieldsMaskForFlag
  signature: void AzeriteItemData::AppendAllowedFieldsMaskForFlag(int & allowedMaskForTarget,
    int fieldVisibilityFlags)
documentation:
  brief: Appends allowed field mask values for a specified visibility flag in Azerite
    item data.
  description: The AppendAllowedFieldsMaskForFlag method modifies an existing integer
    mask by appending new field visibility flags related to Azerite items. This functionality
    is used internally within the TrinityCore framework to manage which fields of
    an Azerite item should be visible or accessible based on specific conditions or
    permissions. The method takes a reference to an integer mask and a set of field
    visibility flags, then updates the mask accordingly. It's typically invoked during
    data serialization or synchronization processes where field access control is
    required for Azerite items.
  parameters:
  - name: allowedMaskForTarget
    description: Reference to an integer that represents the current allowed field
      mask. This value will be modified in-place by appending new visibility flags.
  - name: fieldVisibilityFlags
    description: Integer containing the field visibility flags to append to the allowed
      mask. These flags determine which fields of the Azerite item are permitted for
      access or display.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AppendAllowedFieldsMaskForFlag
    code: 'int mask = 0;

      int visibilityFlags = 0x01 | 0x04; // Example flags

      AzeriteItemData data;

      data.AppendAllowedFieldsMaskForFlag(mask, visibilityFlags);

      // mask now contains the combined visibility flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the input mask in-place and does not return a new value.
    Developers should ensure that the fieldVisibilityFlags parameter correctly represents
    valid Azerite item field visibility constants to avoid unexpected behavior during
    serialization or data handling.
