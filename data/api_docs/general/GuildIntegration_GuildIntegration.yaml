documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GuildIntegration instance with default settings and prepares
    internal data structures for guild-related operations.
  description: The GuildIntegration constructor initializes a new instance of the
    GuildIntegration class. This method sets up default configurations, allocates
    necessary memory, and prepares internal data structures required for handling
    guild-related functionality within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that
    all member variables are properly initialized before any guild operations can
    be performed. The initialization process includes setting up event handlers, configuring
    default parameters, and preparing connection states if applicable. This constructor
    is typically called automatically when creating a new GuildIntegration object,
    and it's essential for proper operation of the guild integration system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GuildIntegration Instantiation
    code: 'GuildIntegration* guildInt = new GuildIntegration();

      // The constructor is automatically called here

      // guildInt is now ready to handle guild operations'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GuildIntegration in a Guild Manager Context
    code: "class GuildManager {\nprivate:\n    GuildIntegration integration;\npublic:\n\
      \    GuildManager() : integration() {} // Constructor calls GuildIntegration()\n\
      \    void ProcessGuildEvents() {\n        // integration is now properly initialized\n\
      \        // Can safely perform guild operations\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs essential setup for the GuildIntegration class.
    It's important to note that while this method initializes internal state, it does
    not establish actual connections or perform network operations. The actual guild
    integration functionality may require additional configuration or explicit initialization
    calls after construction.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly on an already initialized object
    as it may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior. The GuildIntegration class
    should be properly managed through smart pointers or standard object lifetime
    management practices.
