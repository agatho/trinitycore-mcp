  class: ThreatReference
  method: AddThreat
  signature: void ThreatReference::AddThreat(float amount)
documentation:
  brief: Increases the threat value of this reference by the specified amount.
  description: The AddThreat method is used to increase the threat level associated
    with a ThreatReference object. In World of Warcraft's combat system, threat determines
    which creature will target a player or NPC during combat. This method directly
    modifies the internal threat value stored within the reference, typically used
    by AI scripts or combat handlers when a unit performs actions that generate threat
    such as dealing damage or casting spells. The amount parameter specifies how much
    to increase the current threat level, and can be positive or negative depending
    on the desired effect.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The amount of threat to add to the current value. Can be positive
      (increasing threat) or negative (decreasing threat).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Increase Example
    code: 'ThreatReference* threatRef = ...;

      threatRef->AddThreat(100.0f); // Increases threat by 100 points'
    language: cpp
  - title: Decreasing Threat Example
    code: 'ThreatReference* threatRef = ...;

      threatRef->AddThreat(-50.0f); // Decreases threat by 50 points'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal threat value directly without triggering
    any additional combat events or recalculations. It's typically called internally
    by the game engine when units perform actions that generate threat, but can also
    be invoked manually for custom AI behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using negative values as they may reduce threat below
    zero, potentially causing unexpected targeting behavior in some cases. Ensure
    proper bounds checking if manually calling this method with large values.
