documentation:
  brief: Destroys a RoleAssignment object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the RoleAssignment class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. In the
    context of TrinityCore's role management system, this method ensures that when
    a RoleAssignment object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, all associated
    data structures and references are properly deallocated to prevent memory leaks.
    This destructor typically handles cleanup tasks such as releasing internal buffers,
    decrementing reference counts, or notifying other subsystems about the destruction
    of the role assignment. It is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an
    object is destroyed, and should not be called manually unless performing explicit
    object deletion.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    RoleAssignment assignment;\n    // ... use assignment\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when assignment goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion
    code: 'RoleAssignment* assignment = new RoleAssignment();

      // ... use assignment ...

      delete assignment; // Triggers destructor

      assignment = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual in the base class if inheritance is
    used, ensuring proper cleanup of derived class members. It's important to note
    that this destructor does not perform any game logic or state changes; it only
    handles memory management.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke this destructor unless you are explicitly managing
    object lifetime through dynamic allocation. Calling it directly on stack-allocated
    objects will result in undefined behavior.
