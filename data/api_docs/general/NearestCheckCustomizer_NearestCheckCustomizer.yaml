  class: NearestCheckCustomizer
  method: NearestCheckCustomizer
  signature: void NearestCheckCustomizer::NearestCheckCustomizer(const int & obj,
    float range)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a nearest object check customizer with specified object and range
    parameters.
  description: The NearestCheckCustomizer constructor initializes a customizer for
    checking the nearest objects within a given range. This class is typically used
    in AI or game logic to define criteria for finding nearby entities such as players,
    creatures, or game objects. The method sets up internal state based on the provided
    object identifier and search range, which can then be used by other methods to
    perform proximity-based evaluations. It's commonly employed in pathfinding, targeting
    systems, or behavior decision-making within TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Reference to an integer representing the object identifier (GUID)
      of the target entity to check against. This value typically corresponds to a
      player, creature, or game object in the world.
  - name: range
    description: A floating-point value specifying the maximum distance within which
      to search for nearby objects. The range defines the radius of the search area
      around the specified object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'NearestCheckCustomizer customizer(playerGuid, 50.0f);

      // Initializes a customizer to check for nearby objects within 50 yards of the
      player.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: 'uint64 targetGuid = unit->GetGUID();

      float searchRange = 30.0f;

      NearestCheckCustomizer customizer(targetGuid, searchRange);

      // Used to set up proximity checks for NPC behavior logic.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a utility class designed to support AI decision-making
    processes in TrinityCore. It does not perform any actual object checking but rather
    prepares the parameters needed for subsequent operations that evaluate proximity.
    The object identifier should be valid and correspond to an existing entity in
    the world; otherwise, behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided object GUID is valid and refers to an active
    entity before using this customizer. Invalid or stale GUIDs can lead to unexpected
    behavior during proximity checks. Also note that this constructor only sets up
    internal state; actual checking logic must be implemented separately.
