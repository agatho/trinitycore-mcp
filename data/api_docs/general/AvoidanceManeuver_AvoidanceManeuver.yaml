documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new avoidance maneuver instance with default parameters.
  description: The AvoidanceManeuver constructor initializes a new instance of the
    AvoidanceManeuver class. This method sets up the internal state of the maneuver,
    including default values for all relevant properties such as cooldown timers,
    activation status, and movement parameters. The constructor ensures that the maneuver
    is in a valid initial state ready for use within the combat AI system. No specific
    preconditions are required for calling this constructor, though it should typically
    be invoked during object creation or initialization phases of the game logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of AvoidanceManeuver
    code: 'AvoidanceManeuver maneuver;

      // Creates a new avoidance maneuver with default settings'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the AI system when creating
    new maneuver instances. It does not perform any complex initialization logic,
    but rather sets up basic state variables that are required for the maneuver to
    function correctly in combat situations.
