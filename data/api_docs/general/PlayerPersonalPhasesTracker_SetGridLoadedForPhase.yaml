  class: PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker
  method: SetGridLoadedForPhase
  signature: void PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker::SetGridLoadedForPhase(uint32 gridId,
    uint32 phaseId)
documentation:
  brief: Marks a specific grid as loaded for the given phase in the player's personal
    phases tracker.
  description: The SetGridLoadedForPhase method is used to indicate that a particular
    grid (identified by gridId) has been loaded and is active for the specified phase
    (phaseId). This functionality is part of the player's personal phases tracking
    system, which manages how different phases affect visibility and interaction within
    specific grid areas. The method likely updates internal tracking structures to
    ensure that phase-based restrictions or enhancements are properly applied when
    the player interacts with objects or areas within that grid. This is crucial for
    maintaining correct phase behavior in World of Warcraft's phased content systems.
  parameters:
  - name: gridId
    description: The unique identifier of the grid area to mark as loaded for the
      specified phase. Grids are typically defined by their coordinates or spatial
      regions within the game world.
  - name: phaseId
    description: The phase identifier that determines which phase the grid is considered
      loaded for. Phases in TrinityCore represent different states or versions of
      content that may be visible or hidden to players based on their current phase
      membership.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Marking a Grid as Loaded for a Phase
    code: 'PlayerPersonalPhasesTracker* tracker = player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker();

      tracker->SetGridLoadedForPhase(1234, 5678);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the core game systems to manage
    phase-based grid loading. It may be called automatically when a player enters
    a new grid area or when phase changes occur. The implementation probably involves
    updating internal data structures that track which grids are loaded for which
    phases.
