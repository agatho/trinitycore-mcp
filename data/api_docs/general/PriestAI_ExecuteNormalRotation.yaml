  signature: bool PriestAI::ExecuteNormalRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the normal rotation logic for a priest AI, returning true if an
    action was performed.
  description: The ExecuteNormalRotation method is responsible for executing the core
    combat logic of a priest AI in TrinityCore. It evaluates the current state of
    the priest and its target to determine the appropriate spell or ability to cast
    based on standard priest rotation priorities. This includes handling mana management,
    cooldowns, and targeting logic. The method returns true if an action was successfully
    executed, and false otherwise. It is typically called during the AI's update cycle
    to make decisions about spell casting in combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a spell or ability was successfully cast or queued as part
    of the normal rotation; returns false if no action was taken due to conditions
    such as insufficient mana, cooldowns, or target invalidity.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (ExecuteNormalRotation(nullptr))\n        return;\n\
      \n    // Fallback logic\n    DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making system and should only
    be called when the AI has a valid target. The method assumes that the priest's
    current target is accessible via the AI's internal target tracking mechanisms.
    Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary spell checks and ensuring
    proper cooldown management to prevent spamming.
  warnings: Do not call this method without first verifying that the AI has a valid
    target and that the priest is in combat state. Calling this method outside of
    combat or with an invalid target may result in undefined behavior or failed spell
    casts.
