  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: CheckCollisionWithOtherBots
  signature: bool PositionStrategyBase::CheckCollisionWithOtherBots(const int & pos,
    Player * excludeBot) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a given position collides with other bots in the world.
  description: The CheckCollisionWithOtherBots method determines whether a specified
    position in the game world would result in a collision with any existing bot characters.
    This is typically used during pathfinding or positioning logic to ensure that
    bots do not occupy the same space or intersect with other bots. The method takes
    into account the exclusion of a specific bot (passed as the excludeBot parameter)
    to allow for self-collision checks where a bot may be checking its own potential
    movement. It performs spatial queries against the game world's collision system
    to evaluate whether the given position is valid for bot placement or movement.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index or identifier used to reference a specific location
      in the world. This could represent an array index, a coordinate set, or a unique
      identifier for a potential position.
  - name: excludeBot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing a bot that should be
      excluded from collision checks. This allows the method to determine if a position
      is safe for movement while avoiding collisions with other bots, except for the
      specified one.
  returns: Returns true if the specified position collides with any other bots in
    the world (excluding the one passed in excludeBot), indicating that the position
    is not valid for use. Returns false if no collision is detected, meaning the position
    is safe to use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Collision Check
    code: "if (!positionStrategy.CheckCollisionWithOtherBots(5, playerBot)) {\n  \
      \  // Position 5 is safe for bot movement\n    playerBot->MoveToPosition(5);\n\
      } else {\n    // Avoid position 5 due to collision\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"ai\", \"\
      Position 5 collides with other bots.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Collision Check in Pathfinding
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < maxPositions; ++i) {\n    if (!positionStrategy.CheckCollisionWithOtherBots(i,\
      \ currentBot)) {\n        // Found a valid position for pathing\n        newPath.push_back(i);\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}\nif (newPath.empty()) {\n    LOG_ERROR(\"ai\", \"\
      No valid positions found for bot movement.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial partitioning or collision detection systems
    within TrinityCore to efficiently determine if a position is occupied by another
    bot. It may involve checking bounding boxes, collision volumes, or other geometric
    representations of the bots in the world.
  warnings: Ensure that the pos parameter refers to a valid position index or coordinate
    system used by the PositionStrategyBase implementation. Passing an invalid index
    could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
