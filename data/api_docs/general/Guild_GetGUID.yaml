  method: GetGUID
  signature: int Guild::GetGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the guild
  description: The GetGUID method retrieves the globally unique identifier assigned
    to the guild within the TrinityCore world database. This identifier is used internally
    by the game engine to uniquely reference the guild across all systems and is typically
    used for database lookups, network synchronization, and maintaining references
    between different parts of the game logic. The returned value represents a 32-bit
    integer that uniquely identifies this specific guild instance in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the guild.
    This is typically a positive integer greater than zero, with zero usually indicating
    an invalid or uninitialized guild state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Guild* myGuild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildById(guildId);\nif (myGuild)\n{\n \
      \   int guildGUID = myGuild->GetGUID();\n    // Use guildGUID for further operations\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GUID in Database Queries
    code: "Guild* guild = sGuildMgr->GetGuildByName(\"The Brave Knights\");\nif (guild)\n\
      {\n    uint32 guid = guild->GetGUID();\n    // Use this GUID to query guild-related\
      \ data\n    PreparedStatement* stmt = LoginDatabase.GetPreparedStatement(LOGIN_SEL_GUILD_INFO);\n\
      \    stmt->setUInt32(0, guid);\n    // Execute statement...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GUID returned by this method is assigned when the guild is created and
    remains constant throughout the guild's lifetime. It's important to note that
    this value should not be used directly for display purposes as it's an internal
    identifier, not a user-friendly name or tag.
  warnings: Do not assume that all guilds will have valid GUIDs. Always check if the
    returned value is non-zero before using it in operations that require a valid
    identifier. Also, be aware that this method returns a const value, so it cannot
    modify the guild object.
