api:
  class: MarketAnalysis
  method: ValidatePredictions
  signature: void MarketAnalysis::ValidatePredictions()
documentation:
  brief: Validates market predictions against current auction house data to ensure
    accuracy and reliability.
  description: 'The ValidatePredictions method performs a comprehensive check of all
    generated market predictions within the MarketAnalysis class. It compares predicted
    values against real-time auction house data, identifying discrepancies and updating
    internal validation flags. This method ensures that prediction models remain accurate
    and relevant by cross-referencing with actual market transactions. The validation
    process includes checking for outdated predictions, verifying price consistency,
    and ensuring that all predictions align with current supply and demand trends.
    Precondition: MarketAnalysis must have valid predictions stored in memory. Postcondition:
    All predictions are marked as either validated or invalidated based on comparison
    results.'

  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: 'MarketAnalysis analysis;

      // Assume predictions have been generated

      analysis.ValidatePredictions();

      // Predictions are now validated against current market data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically to maintain prediction accuracy.
    It may cause performance overhead during high-traffic periods due to database
    queries and data comparisons.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior prediction generation will result in
    no-op behavior. The validation process modifies internal state, so concurrent
    access should be synchronized.
