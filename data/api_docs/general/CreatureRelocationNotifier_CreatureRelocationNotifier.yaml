  class: CreatureRelocationNotifier
  method: CreatureRelocationNotifier
  signature: void CreatureRelocationNotifier::CreatureRelocationNotifier(int & c)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureRelocationNotifier object with a reference to an integer
    counter.
  description: The CreatureRelocationNotifier constructor initializes an instance
    of the CreatureRelocationNotifier class. This class is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server to handle creature relocation events within the
    game world. The constructor takes a reference to an integer parameter 'c', which
    likely serves as a counter or flag to track relocation events. The notifier is
    responsible for managing how creatures are relocated and updating relevant systems
    accordingly. This constructor does not perform any complex operations but sets
    up the internal state of the notifier object for subsequent use in the game's
    relocation handling system.
  parameters:
  - name: c
    description: Reference to an integer counter that tracks relocation events or
      states. This parameter is typically used internally by the CreatureRelocationNotifier
      to maintain state information about creature movements within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction of CreatureRelocationNotifier
    code: 'int relocationCounter = 0;

      CreatureRelocationNotifier notifier(relocationCounter);

      // The notifier is now initialized with the counter reference'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor appears to be part of a larger system for managing creature
    movement and relocation in the game world. The integer reference 'c' likely serves
    as a synchronization or state tracking mechanism. This class is probably used
    internally by the server's map management systems when creatures are moved between
    different grid cells or zones.
