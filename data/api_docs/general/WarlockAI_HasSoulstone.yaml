  method: HasSoulstone
  signature: bool WarlockAI::HasSoulstone()
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the warlock has a soulstone in their inventory.
  description: The HasSoulstone method determines whether the WarlockAI instance currently
    possesses a soulstone item. This is a crucial check for warlock AI behavior, particularly
    when deciding whether to cast rituals or use soulstone-related abilities. The
    method typically examines the warlock's inventory for soulstone items and returns
    true if at least one is found. This functionality directly impacts the AI's decision-making
    process in combat scenarios where soulstones are used for resurrection or mana
    regeneration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a soulstone is present in the warlock's inventory, false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (warlockAI->HasSoulstone()) {\n    // Proceed with soulstone-based actions\n\
      \    warlockAI->CastSoulstoneRitual();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Behavior
    code: "void WarlockAI::UpdateAI() {\n    if (HasSoulstone()) {\n        // Use\
      \ soulstone for mana regeneration or resurrection\n        if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30) {\n            CastSoulstoneMana();\n        }\n    } else {\n     \
      \   // Fallback behavior when no soulstone available\n        CastShadowBolt();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks for specific soulstone item types (e.g., Soulstone,
    Greater Soulstone) in the warlock's inventory. The implementation may cache the
    result to avoid repeated inventory scans during AI updates. This check is essential
    for proper warlock AI behavior and should be called before attempting to use soulstone
    abilities.
  warnings: The method does not account for soulstones that might be equipped in a
    character's bag but not actively usable (e.g., soulstones in trade windows or
    locked containers). It also assumes the AI has access to inventory information,
    which may not always be the case in certain game states or custom implementations.
