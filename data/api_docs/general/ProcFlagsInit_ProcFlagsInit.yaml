  signature: void ProcFlagsInit::ProcFlagsInit(ProcFlags procFlags, ProcFlags2 procFlags2)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes proc flags and secondary proc flags for spell or effect handling
    in the TrinityCore framework.
  description: The ProcFlagsInit method is used to initialize the proc flags and secondary
    proc flags for a given spell or effect within the TrinityCore engine. This method
    sets up internal state that determines how and when procs (triggered effects)
    are activated based on various game events such as damage dealt, healing done,
    or specific actions performed by players or creatures. It is typically called
    during spell initialization or when setting up triggered effects to ensure proper
    behavior according to the defined proc conditions. The method takes two parameters
    representing primary and secondary proc flag sets which control the activation
    criteria for procs.
  parameters:
  - name: procFlags
    description: Primary proc flags that define the conditions under which a proc
      can be triggered. These flags specify types of events such as damage dealt,
      healing done, or specific combat actions that activate the proc.
  - name: procFlags2
    description: Secondary proc flags that provide additional filtering and control
      over proc activation. These flags often include more granular conditions like
      specific spell school, weapon type, or other specialized trigger requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Flags Initialization
    code: ProcFlagsInit(ProcFlags::PROC_FLAG_DAMAGE_DONE | ProcFlags::PROC_FLAG_MELEE_SWING,
      ProcFlags2::PROC_FLAG2_NORMAL_HIT);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Proc Flags Setup for Spell Effect
    code: "ProcFlagsInit(\n    ProcFlags::PROC_FLAG_ON_CAST_SPELL | ProcFlags::PROC_FLAG_DONE_SPELL_DAMAGE,\n\
      \    ProcFlags2::PROC_FLAG2_SPELL_CAST | ProcFlags2::PROC_FLAG2_DAMAGE_OVER_TIME\n\
      );"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during spell loading or initialization phases.
    It's important to understand that proc flags are cumulative and must be properly
    combined using bitwise OR operations. The method does not validate flag combinations,
    so developers should ensure logical consistency in their flag usage.
  warnings: Incorrectly combining proc flags can lead to unexpected behavior or infinite
    loops in triggered effects. Always verify that the proc conditions make sense
    for the intended gameplay effect. Be cautious when mixing primary and secondary
    flags as they may have different activation rules.
