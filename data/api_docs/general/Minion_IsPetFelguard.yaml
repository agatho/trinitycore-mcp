documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the minion is a pet felguard.
  description: The IsPetFelguard method checks if the current minion instance represents
    a pet felguard. This method is typically used in AI and pet management systems
    within TrinityCore to differentiate between various types of summoned creatures
    or pets. It returns true if the minion is specifically a felguard pet, and false
    otherwise. The check is based on internal creature type and summoning properties
    stored within the minion object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the minion is a felguard pet; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (minion->IsPetFelguard()) {\n    // Handle felguard-specific behavior\n\
      \    DoFelguardSpecialAbility();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Pet Handling
    code: "Unit* owner = minion->GetOwner();\nif (owner && minion->IsPetFelguard())\
      \ {\n    // Apply felguard-specific effects or modifications\n    owner->ApplySpellMod(SPELLMOD_DAMAGE,\
      \ SPELLMOD_FLAT, 20);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags and creature type definitions. It's
    important to note that this check is only valid for minion instances that are
    actually summoned pets, not for regular creatures or players.
