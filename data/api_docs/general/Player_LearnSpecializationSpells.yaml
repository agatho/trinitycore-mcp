  brief: Learn specialization spells for the player
  description: This method enables a player to learn all spells associated with their
    current specialization. It automatically grants the player the appropriate spells
    based on their chosen specialization, including the primary spell for that specialization
    and any additional spells required by the class. The method is typically used
    during character creation or when switching specializations to ensure proper spell
    learning.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->LearnSpecializationSpells();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after a player has selected their specialization,
    typically during character creation or when switching specializations. It ensures
    that all relevant spells are properly learned and added to the player's spellbook.
  warnings: This method does not check if the player already knows the spells; it
    simply adds them to the player's spellbook without verifying existing knowledge.
