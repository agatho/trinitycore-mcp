  class: DependencyValidator
  method: ValidateSystemRequirements
  signature: bool DependencyValidator::ValidateSystemRequirements()
documentation:
  brief: Validates that all system requirements for the TrinityCore server are met
    before initialization.
  description: The ValidateSystemRequirements method performs a comprehensive check
    of the system environment to ensure that all necessary prerequisites for running
    a TrinityCore server instance are satisfied. This includes verifying operating
    system compatibility, required libraries, memory availability, and other hardware
    or software dependencies. The method is typically called during the server startup
    process before any core systems are initialized. It returns true if all requirements
    are met, or false if any critical requirement is missing or unsatisfied. This
    validation helps prevent runtime errors due to incompatible environments and ensures
    stable operation of the World of Warcraft emulation server.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all system requirements are satisfied and the environment
    is suitable for running TrinityCore; returns false if one or more requirements
    are not met, which may result in server startup failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server startup
    code: "if (!sDependencyValidator->ValidateSystemRequirements())\n{\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"System requirements validation failed!\" << std::endl;\n    return false;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with server initialization"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked early in the server boot process, often
    before any database connections or world thread initialization. It may perform
    checks such as verifying available RAM, checking for required shared libraries,
    confirming OS version compatibility, and ensuring proper file permissions.
  warnings: Failure to meet system requirements can lead to unpredictable behavior
    or complete server startup failure. This method should not be bypassed during
    production deployments as it ensures the stability and reliability of the emulation
    environment.
