documentation:
  brief: Applies a charge effect to the target, moving the caster towards the target.
  description: The EffectCharge method handles the execution of a charge spell effect,
    where the caster moves directly toward the target position. This method is typically
    used for spells that require the caster to move to a specific location or target,
    such as Charge, Pounce, or similar abilities. It calculates the distance and direction
    between the caster and target, then applies movement mechanics to bring them closer.
    The method may also handle collision detection and potential damage upon arrival
    at the target position.

  - title: Basic Charge Implementation
    code: "void Spell::EffectCharge()\n{\n    // Implementation for charge effect\n\
      \    // Moves caster towards target\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically involves movement calculations and may require handling
    of collision detection. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary
    movement updates during the process.
  warnings: Improper implementation can lead to incorrect positioning or movement
    behavior, especially if target coordinates are not properly calculated before
    execution.
