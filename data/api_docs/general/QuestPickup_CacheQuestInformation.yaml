documentation:
  brief: Caches quest information for the player's current quest pickup state
  description: The CacheQuestInformation method stores relevant quest data associated
    with the current quest pickup event. This includes gathering and storing quest
    identifiers, objective states, reward information, and other metadata that may
    be needed during quest progression or completion. The caching mechanism helps
    optimize performance by reducing redundant database queries or calculations when
    processing quest-related actions. This method is typically invoked when a player
    interacts with a quest giver or picks up a quest to ensure all necessary data
    is readily available for subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Quest Pickup Handler
    code: "void HandleQuestPickup(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    QuestPickup\
      \ pickup(player, quest);\n    pickup.CacheQuestInformation();\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest processing using cached data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any quest state modifications to ensure
    accurate caching. The cached data is typically invalidated when the player's quest
    state changes or when a new quest pickup occurs. Implementation may involve internal
    data structures that store quest-related information in memory for quick access.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the QuestPickup object
    may result in undefined behavior. Ensure that all required quest data is valid
    before invoking this method to avoid caching incomplete or incorrect information.
