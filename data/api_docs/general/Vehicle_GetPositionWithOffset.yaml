  method: GetPositionWithOffset
  signature: int Vehicle::GetPositionWithOffset(const int & offset) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the position offset value for the vehicle's current state.
  description: The GetPositionWithOffset method retrieves a specific position offset
    value associated with the vehicle's current state or configuration. This method
    is typically used in vehicle-related game mechanics to determine positional adjustments
    or offsets that may be applied during vehicle movement, mounting, or dismounting
    operations. The returned integer value represents an offset that can be used for
    positioning calculations within the game world. The method does not take any parameters
    and returns a constant value based on the internal state of the vehicle object.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the position offset value. This value typically
    indicates a positional adjustment or offset that should be applied when calculating
    the vehicle's actual position in the game world, often used for mounting points,
    dismounting positions, or animation-related positioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Vehicle Offset
    code: 'Vehicle* vehicle = player->GetVehicle();

      int offset = vehicle->GetPositionWithOffset();

      // Use offset value for positioning calculations

      printf("Vehicle position offset: %d\n", offset);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by the TrinityCore vehicle system to
    manage positional data during vehicle operations. The returned offset value may
    vary depending on the vehicle type, passenger state, or current animation phase.
    Developers should be aware that this method returns a constant value based on
    internal vehicle state and does not perform dynamic calculations.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it takes a const reference to an int parameter
    named 'offset', but the actual implementation appears to have no parameters. This
    may indicate either a documentation error or a placeholder for future functionality.
    Ensure that any usage of this method matches its actual signature in the compiled
    code.
