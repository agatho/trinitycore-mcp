documentation:
  brief: Clears all quest sharing information from the player's data.
  description: This method removes all quest sharing data associated with the player,
    including any shared quest information that may have been stored in memory. It
    is typically used during player logout or when resetting quest-related data to
    ensure clean state management. The method does not return any value and operates
    on the player object directly without requiring any parameters.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ClearQuestSharingInfo();

      // Quest sharing data is cleared from player object'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely clears internal quest
    tracking structures and may reset related quest state flags. Performance considerations
    are minimal as it simply clears memory data without complex operations.
