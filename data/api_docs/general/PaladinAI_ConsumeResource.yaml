  class: PaladinAI
  method: ConsumeResource
  signature: void PaladinAI::ConsumeResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes resources required for a specified paladin spell.
  description: The ConsumeResource method handles the deduction of necessary resources
    such as holy power, mana, or other spell-specific requirements when a paladin
    casts a spell. This method is typically invoked internally by the AI system to
    ensure proper resource management during spell execution. It ensures that the
    paladin has sufficient resources before allowing a spell to be cast and updates
    the internal state accordingly. The method may also trigger additional effects
    such as cooldown resets or resource regeneration delays depending on the spell
    type and class mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the paladin spell being cast. This ID determines
      which resources are consumed and how much is deducted from the paladin's available
      resources.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Consumption
    code: "void PaladinAI::CastSpell(int spellId)\n{\n    // Ensure we have enough\
      \ resources\n    if (HasRequiredResources(spellId))\n    {\n        ConsumeResource(spellId);\n\
      \        // Proceed with actual spell casting logic\n        DoCast(spellId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Select a suitable spell based on current situation\n\
      \    int selectedSpell = SelectBestSpell();\n    \n    if (selectedSpell !=\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        ConsumeResource(selectedSpell);\n        DoCast(selectedSpell);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal AI logic and should not be called directly
    by external systems. It assumes that resource validation has already occurred
    and only performs the actual deduction. The method may modify internal state variables
    related to cooldowns, resource availability, or spell casting status.
  warnings: Calling this method without prior resource validation can lead to invalid
    resource states. Ensure all preconditions are met before invoking this function
    to prevent unexpected behavior or game state corruption.
