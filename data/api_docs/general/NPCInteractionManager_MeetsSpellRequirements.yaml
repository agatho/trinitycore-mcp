documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player meets the spell requirements for a trainer spell.
  description: The MeetsSpellRequirements method evaluates whether the current player
    character satisfies all prerequisites necessary to learn or cast a specific trainer
    spell. This includes checking for required skill levels, prerequisite spells,
    and other conditions defined in the trainer spell data. The method is typically
    used during NPC interaction to determine if a player can access certain training
    options or abilities. It ensures that game balance and progression mechanics are
    properly enforced by validating that players meet the necessary criteria before
    allowing them to interact with trainer spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all spell requirements are met by the player, false otherwise.
    This includes checking skill levels, prerequisite spell knowledge, and any other
    conditions defined in the TrainerSpell structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Interaction
    code: "if (npcInteractionManager->MeetsSpellRequirements(trainerSpell)) {\n  \
      \  // Player can learn or use this spell\n    player->LearnSpell(trainerSpell->spellId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Display appropriate error message to player\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements for this spell.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the TrainerSpell structure which contains all the prerequisite
    information. The implementation likely checks against the player's current skill
    levels, known spells, and other character state data to make its determination.
