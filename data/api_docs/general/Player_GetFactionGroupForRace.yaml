documentation:
  brief: Returns the faction group identifier for a given race.
  description: This method retrieves the faction group associated with a specific
    player race. It is used to determine which faction group (Alliance or Horde) a
    player belongs to based on their race. The method returns a uint8 value representing
    the faction group, where 0 typically indicates Alliance and 1 indicates Horde.
    This functionality is essential for determining player faction relationships and
    can be used in various game mechanics such as questing, vendor interactions, and
    faction-based content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the faction group for the specified
    race. Value 0 indicates Alliance, while value 1 indicates Horde. The method returns
    0 for races that do not have faction group information or when the race is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint8 factionGroup = player->GetFactionGroupForRace(1); // Get faction group
      for Human (race ID 1)
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other faction-related functions
    to determine player behavior and interactions. It may be called during character
    creation or when determining faction relationships. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method simply returns a static value.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid race IDs, as it may return
    unexpected values or cause undefined behavior if not properly handled.
