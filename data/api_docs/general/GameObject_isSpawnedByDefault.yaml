  method: isSpawnedByDefault
  signature: bool GameObject::isSpawnedByDefault() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is set to spawn by default according to
    its database configuration.
  description: The isSpawnedByDefault method checks the internal state of a GameObject
    instance to determine if it was configured to spawn automatically when its map
    is loaded. This flag is typically derived from the game object's entry in the
    'gameobject_template' table within the TrinityCore database, where the 'spawnflags'
    or similar field indicates default spawning behavior. The method returns true
    if the object should be present in the world upon map loading, and false otherwise.
    This functionality is crucial for managing static objects like doors, chests,
    or quest-related items that are expected to appear in specific locations by default.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether the game object is configured to spawn
    by default. Returns true if the object should be spawned automatically upon map
    load; returns false if it should not be spawned unless explicitly summoned or
    triggered.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a GameObject spawns by default
    code: "GameObject* go = player->FindNearestGameObject(GO_ID, 5.0f);\nif (go &&\
      \ go->isSpawnedByDefault())\n{\n    // This object is set to spawn by default\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"GameObject %u spawns by default.\", go->GetEntry());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the GameObject's internal state which is initialized
    from database values during object creation. The result of this method may be
    affected by any dynamic modifications to spawn flags or game object states at
    runtime.
