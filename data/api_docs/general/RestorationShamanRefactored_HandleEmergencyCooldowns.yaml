  class: RestorationShamanRefactored
  method: HandleEmergencyCooldowns
  signature: bool RestorationShamanRefactored::HandleEmergencyCooldowns(const int
    & group)
documentation:
  brief: Handles emergency cooldown management for restoration shaman abilities based
    on specified group.
  description: The HandleEmergencyCooldowns method manages the application and execution
    of emergency cooldown reductions or activations for a restoration shaman's abilities.
    It evaluates the current state of the shaman's cooldowns and applies necessary
    adjustments to ensure optimal performance during critical gameplay moments. This
    method typically triggers when specific conditions are met, such as entering combat
    or reaching certain health thresholds. The method operates on predefined groups
    of abilities that are considered emergency or high-priority for the restoration
    shaman class.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific group of cooldowns
      to process. Valid values correspond to predefined emergency ability sets within
      the restoration shaman's spell system.
  returns: Returns true if the emergency cooldown handling was successfully processed
    and applied, false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no applicable
    cooldowns were found or that the conditions for processing were not met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (shaman->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(1)) {\n    // Emergency cooldowns\
      \ processed successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Emergency cooldowns applied\
      \ for group 1\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "int emergencyGroup = player->GetHealthPercent() < 30 ? 2 : 1;\nif (shaman->HandleEmergencyCooldowns(emergencyGroup))\
      \ {\n    // Apply emergency cooldown reduction for low health state\n    shaman->CastSpell(player,\
      \ SPELL_EMERGENCY_COOLDOWN_REDUCTION, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state transitions or when specific
    health thresholds are crossed. The implementation assumes that the shaman object
    has valid references to its spell and cooldown systems. Performance-wise, this
    method should be lightweight as it's often invoked in time-sensitive combat scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the group parameter corresponds to a valid emergency cooldown
    set; invalid values may cause undefined behavior or no action to be taken. This
    method should not be called outside of combat contexts unless explicitly designed
    for such usage.
