documentation:
  brief: Initializes and sends transport data to a player's client for all transports
    present on the map.
  description: The SendInitTransports method is responsible for sending the initial
    transport state information to a specific player's client. This includes details
    about all transport vehicles (such as boats, zeppelins, or other moving platforms)
    that are currently active on the map. The method ensures that the player's client
    has up-to-date information about transport positions, movement states, and related
    data necessary for proper client-side rendering and interaction with transports.
    It is typically called during player login or when a player enters a new map area
    where transports may be present.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    Map* map = GetMap();\n    map->SendInitTransports(this);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the map initialization process and should only be
    called when a player enters a map. It's important to note that this method sends
    data for ALL transports on the map, not just those relevant to the specific player.
    The actual transport data is prepared by the transport system and sent through
    the packet system.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper map context or before the player has
    fully loaded into the world may result in incomplete or incorrect transport data
    being sent to the client. This could lead to visual glitches or players being
    unable to interact with transports properly.
