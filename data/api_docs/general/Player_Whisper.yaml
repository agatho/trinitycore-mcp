documentation:
  brief: Send a whisper message to another player with specified text ID
  description: The Player::Whisper method allows a player to send a whispered message
    to another player using a predefined text ID. This method is commonly used for
    communication between players in World of Warcraft, particularly when dealing
    with NPC interactions or player-to-player communication. The method supports both
    regular whispers and boss whispers, which are typically reserved for special encounters
    or boss battles where the whisper message needs to be sent with special formatting
    or handling.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The unique identifier for the text message to be sent. This ID corresponds
      to a specific text entry in the game's database, allowing for precise communication
      between players.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player object who will receive the whisper
      message. This parameter must point to a valid Player object or the method will
      fail.
  - name: isBossWhisper
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether this is a boss whisper. When true,
      special handling is applied for boss encounters, typically involving special
      formatting or message delivery mechanisms.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Player Whisper Example
    code: 'Player* target = Player::GetPlayer("target");

      uint32 textId = 1000;

      Player->Whisper(textId, target, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Boss Whisper Example
    code: 'Player* target = Player::GetPlayer("target");

      uint32 textId = 1000;

      Player->Whisper(textId, target, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method requires that both the sender and receiver be valid Player objects.
    The textId must correspond to an existing text entry in the game database. This
    method is typically used for communication with NPCs or other players during quest
    progression, and may involve special handling for boss encounters.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to communication errors or failed
    whispers. Ensure that the target player exists and is valid before calling this
    method. Also note that boss whispers require special handling and should be used
    appropriately in boss encounters.
