  method: UseBarrierSpells
  signature: void MageAI::UseBarrierSpells()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and applies appropriate barrier spells for the Mage AI during
    combat.
  description: The UseBarrierSpells method evaluates the current combat situation
    and selects suitable barrier spells to apply to the mage character. This method
    is part of the MageAI class's core functionality, responsible for managing defensive
    spell usage in response to enemy threats. It typically checks for incoming damage,
    enemy proximity, and available mana before casting protective barriers such as
    Ice Block, Mana Shield, or other defensive spells. The method ensures optimal
    resource management while maintaining the mage's survivability during intense
    combat scenarios.

    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    if (m_mage->GetHealthPct() < 50)\n        UseBarrierSpells();\n    // ...\
      \ rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically during combat updates to ensure
    timely application of defensive spells. The implementation likely includes checks
    for spell cooldowns and mana availability before casting any barrier spells.
  warnings: Ensure that the MageAI instance has valid access to the player object
    and its spell system before calling this method, as it may cause crashes if the
    mage reference is invalid or uninitialized.
