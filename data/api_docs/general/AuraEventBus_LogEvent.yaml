documentation:
  brief: Logs an aura event with associated action string to the event bus
  description: The LogEvent method records a given AuraEvent along with a descriptive
    action string into the aura event bus system. This functionality is used for tracking
    and monitoring aura-related activities within the TrinityCore framework, such
    as aura application, removal, or modification. The method serves primarily for
    debugging, logging, and analytics purposes, allowing developers to trace the lifecycle
    of auras throughout the game world. It does not modify the aura itself but rather
    creates a persistent record of its occurrence.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The AuraEvent object containing details about the aura event that
      occurred. This includes information such as the aura's caster, target, spell
      ID, and event type.
  - name: action
    description: A descriptive string indicating the action or context of the aura
      event. For example, 'Applied', 'Removed', or 'Updated'. Used for categorizing
      log entries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuraEvent auraEvent;

      // ... populate auraEvent with relevant data ...

      AuraEventBus::GetGlobalAuraEventBus().LogEvent(auraEvent, "Applied");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Custom Action String
    code: 'AuraEvent auraEvent;

      // ... populate auraEvent with relevant data ...

      std::string action = "SpellEffect" + std::to_string(auraEvent.GetSpellId());

      AuraEventBus::GetGlobalAuraEventBus().LogEvent(auraEvent, action);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with logging systems or debugging
    tools to monitor aura behavior. It's important to note that the event bus may
    have performance implications if used excessively during high-frequency events
    like periodic auras. Consider batching log entries or using conditional logging
    for performance-critical code paths.
  warnings: Ensure that the AuraEvent object passed is fully initialized before calling
    this method, as invalid data could lead to incorrect logging. Also, be cautious
    when using this in tight loops or frequent event handlers, as it may impact performance
    if not properly optimized.
