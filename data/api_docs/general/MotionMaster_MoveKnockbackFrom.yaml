  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveKnockbackFrom
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveKnockbackFrom(const Position & origin, float speedXY,
    float speedZ, const Movement::SpellEffectExtraData * spellEffectExtraData)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a knockback movement away from a specified origin position with
    configurable horizontal and vertical speeds.
  description: The MoveKnockbackFrom method starts a knockback motion for a unit,
    moving it away from a given origin point. This is commonly used in game mechanics
    such as spell effects, combat abilities, or environmental interactions that push
    units away from a source. The movement includes both horizontal (XY) and vertical
    (Z) velocity components, allowing for realistic physics-based displacement. The
    method utilizes the provided spell effect data to determine additional parameters
    if needed. It does not block execution; instead, it queues the movement action
    which will be processed by the motion system.
  parameters:
  - name: origin
    description: The Position from which the knockback originates. This defines the
      direction and point of reference for the movement.
  - name: speedXY
    description: Horizontal speed component (in game units per second) for the knockback
      motion along the X and Y axes.
  - name: speedZ
    description: Vertical speed component (in game units per second) for the knockback
      motion along the Z axis, determining upward or downward movement.
  - name: spellEffectExtraData
    description: Optional pointer to extra spell effect data that may contain additional
      parameters influencing the knockback behavior. Can be null if no special handling
      is required.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Knockback Usage
    code: 'Position knockbackOrigin(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f);

      float speedXY = 10.0f;

      float speedZ = 5.0f;

      motionMaster->MoveKnockbackFrom(knockbackOrigin, speedXY, speedZ, nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Knockback with Spell Effect Data
    code: 'Position origin(100.0f, 200.0f, 50.0f);

      float speedXY = 15.0f;

      float speedZ = 8.0f;

      Movement::SpellEffectExtraData extraData;

      extraData.SetKnockbackAngle(1.57f); // 90 degrees in radians

      motionMaster->MoveKnockbackFrom(origin, speedXY, speedZ, &extraData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method integrates with TrinityCore's movement and AI systems. It assumes
    the unit has a valid motion master instance and that the movement is not obstructed
    by terrain or other entities unless explicitly handled in the spell effect data.
    The actual movement path may be adjusted based on the unit's current state and
    environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Position coordinates are valid and within expected
    bounds to avoid unexpected behavior. Passing a null pointer for spellEffectExtraData
    is safe but may result in default knockback properties being applied.
