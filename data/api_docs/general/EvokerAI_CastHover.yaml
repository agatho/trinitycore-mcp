  brief: Initiates the casting of the Hover spell for the evoker unit.
  description: The CastHover method is responsible for triggering the Hover spell
    cast animation and logic for an EvokerAI-controlled unit. This method typically
    handles the necessary checks to ensure the spell can be cast, such as verifying
    mana availability, cooldown status, and target validity. It may also manage the
    spell's visual effects and update internal AI state variables related to spell
    usage. The Hover spell in World of Warcraft is an evoker ability that allows the
    unit to hover above the ground, often used for mobility or positioning purposes
    during combat.

  notes: This method is likely called internally by the AI system during combat updates
    or in response to specific conditions. It may perform checks for spell eligibility
    before casting and could be part of a larger spell selection or targeting logic
    within the EvokerAI class.
