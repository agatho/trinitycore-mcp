api:
  class: Player
  method: SkipQuests
  signature: void Player::SkipQuests(const int & questIds)
documentation:
  brief: Skips specified quest(s) for the player, preventing them from being tracked
    or completed.
  description: The SkipQuests method allows a player to bypass specific quests in
    their quest log, effectively removing them from the active tracking and completion
    process. This method is typically used during questing to skip certain objectives
    or to prevent a quest from being marked as complete when it should remain incomplete.
    The method takes an integer reference to a quest ID and removes that quest from
    the player's quest log, ensuring it won't be processed further in the game mechanics.
    It is particularly useful for developers or advanced players who want to manipulate
    quest progression without affecting the overall quest system.
  parameters:
  - name: questIds
    description: An integer reference representing the ID of the quest(s) to be skipped.
      This parameter must be a valid quest ID within the game's quest database, and
      should not be zero or negative. If multiple quest IDs are provided, each will
      be skipped individually.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      int questId = 12345;

      player->SkipQuests(questId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple quests skipping
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nint questIds[] = {12345, 12346, 12347};\n\
      for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)\n{\n    player->SkipQuests(questIds[i]);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly affect quest completion or reward mechanics,
    but rather removes the quest from the player's active quest log. It should be
    used carefully to avoid unintended consequences in quest progression. The method
    may not work if the quest has already been completed or if it is part of a quest
    chain that requires specific progression.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that skipped quests will remain completely
    hidden from the player's quest log. If the quest is part of a quest chain, skipping
    one quest may cause issues with subsequent quests in the chain. Also, this method
    should not be used to bypass quest requirements or objectives that are essential
    for game progression.
