  class: InstanceScript
  method: SetBossNumber
  signature: void InstanceScript::SetBossNumber(uint32 number)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of bosses in the instance, typically used during instance
    initialization or boss encounter management.
  description: The SetBossNumber method is used to define the total number of bosses
    that will be encountered within an instance. This value is crucial for tracking
    boss encounters, managing instance data, and determining when all required bosses
    have been defeated. The method is typically called during instance creation or
    reset phases, and it initializes internal tracking mechanisms for boss states.
    It does not directly control boss spawning but rather sets up the framework for
    tracking how many bosses are expected in the current instance.
  parameters:
  - name: number
    description: The total number of bosses that will be present in this instance.
      This value determines how many boss encounters need to be tracked and managed
      throughout the instance lifecycle.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Boss Count for a Raid Instance
    code: "class BossInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    BossInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n    \n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n\
      \        // Set the number of bosses in this raid instance\n        SetBossNumber(8);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Boss Count After Encounter Changes
    code: "void BossInstanceScript::OnBossDeath(uint32 bossId)\n{\n    // Update boss\
      \ count when a boss is defeated\n    if (bossId == 5)\n    {\n        SetBossNumber(7);\
      \ // One less boss remaining\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any boss encounters begin to ensure proper
    tracking. The value set by this method is used in conjunction with other instance
    management functions like GetBossState() and SetBossState(). It's important to
    note that this method does not validate the number of bosses against actual encounter
    data, so developers must ensure consistency between this value and the actual
    number of boss encounters defined in the instance.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the boss number can lead to inconsistent tracking
    of boss encounters, potentially causing issues with instance completion, loot
    distribution, or quest progression. Always verify that the number passed matches
    the actual expected boss count in your instance design.
