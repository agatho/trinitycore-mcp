  class: MythicPlusInterruptScaling
  method: GetReactionTimeModifier
  signature: float MythicPlusInterruptScaling::GetReactionTimeModifier(uint8 level)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the reaction time modifier for mythic plus dungeon
    scaling based on player level.
  description: The GetReactionTimeModifier method computes a floating-point value
    that represents how player reaction times are scaled within mythic plus dungeons.
    This modifier is used to adjust the timing of various game mechanics, such as
    enemy AI behavior or interrupt window durations, relative to the player's level.
    The calculation typically scales based on the player's level compared to the dungeon's
    intended difficulty range, ensuring that higher-level players face appropriately
    challenging reaction-based encounters. This method does not take any parameters
    and relies on internal state or configuration values related to mythic plus scaling
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the reaction time modifier. Values are typically
    greater than or equal to 1.0, where higher values indicate increased reaction
    time requirements or more challenging timing mechanics for the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float modifier = instance->GetReactionTimeModifier(10);

      // Returns a float value representing the reaction time modifier for level 10
      player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger scaling system that adjusts various
    gameplay elements based on player level in mythic plus dungeons. The actual implementation
    details may depend on internal configuration tables or dynamic calculations based
    on dungeon level and player progression.
