  signature: void LfgGroupData::LfgGroupData(LfgGroupData && other)
documentation:
  brief: Moves another LfgGroupData object's resources into this instance, leaving
    the source object in a valid but unspecified state.
  description: The LfgGroupData move constructor transfers all resources from the
    provided rvalue reference parameter to the current object. This operation is typically
    used for efficient resource management when creating new LfgGroupData instances
    from temporary or existing objects. The source object will be left in a valid
    but unspecified state after the move, meaning it should not be used for further
    operations until reassigned. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG (Looking For
    Group) system, this constructor facilitates efficient handling of group data structures
    during matchmaking and group formation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move construction from temporary object
    code: 'LfgGroupData group1;

      // ... populate group1 ...

      LfgGroupData group2 = std::move(group1); // Moves resources from group1 to group2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Move in container operations
    code: 'std::vector<LfgGroupData> groups;

      groups.emplace_back();

      // ... populate the last element ...

      LfgGroupData newGroup = std::move(groups.back()); // Move the last group from
      vector'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed to avoid
    expensive deep copies by transferring ownership of resources. After moving, the
    source object should be considered in a valid but unspecified state and should
    not be used for further operations unless reassigned.
  warnings: Using the moved-from object after a move operation results in undefined
    behavior. Ensure that no further operations are performed on the source object
    after calling this constructor with an rvalue reference.
