documentation:
  brief: Handles the client request to offer a petition to another player in the game.
  description: The HandleOfferPetition method processes a packet sent by a player
    when they wish to offer a petition (such as a guild charter or a signature request)
    to another player. This method validates the target player's eligibility and ensures
    the petition can be properly offered. It typically checks if the recipient is
    valid, not already signed, and within the appropriate game context. The method
    does not return any value but may trigger in-game events such as sending a notification
    to the target player or updating petition status.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

      \ notification to target player\n    // Update petition state in database\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the petition system in TrinityCore, which supports
    guild charters and other signature-based game mechanics. It assumes that the packet
    contains valid data about the petitioner and the target player.
