  class: QuestEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & QuestEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistical information about quest events processed by the
    QuestEventBus.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics structure that holds various metrics and counters related to quest
    event processing within the QuestEventBus. This includes data such as the number
    of events handled, success rates, error counts, and other performance-related
    statistics. The returned Statistics object is read-only and provides insight into
    how efficiently the quest event system is operating. This method is typically
    used for monitoring, debugging, or reporting purposes to understand the behavior
    and performance of quest-related events in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics object containing detailed metrics
    about quest event processing, including counts of handled events, success/failure
    statistics, and performance data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Print Quest Event Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = questEventBus.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Events: " << stats.totalEvents << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Success Rate: " << stats.successRate << "%" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is immutable and should not be modified directly.
    The statistics are updated in real-time as events are processed, making this method
    suitable for live monitoring. This method does not perform any expensive operations
    and is safe to call frequently.
