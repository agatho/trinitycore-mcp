  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::OnAddMember(Group * group, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a new member is added to a player bot group
  description: The OnAddMember method is invoked whenever a new member joins a player
    bot group in the TrinityCore environment. This callback allows custom scripts
    to execute specific logic or modifications when group membership changes occur.
    The method receives a pointer to the Group object and the GUID of the newly added
    member, enabling developers to perform actions such as initializing new member
    behaviors, updating group strategies, or triggering events based on the addition.
    This method is part of the PlayerbotGroupScript interface which extends the standard
    group management functionality for player bots.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player bot group to
      which a member was added
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the newly
      added group member
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic implementation of OnAddMember
    code: "class MyPlayerbotGroupScript : public PlayerbotGroupScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    void OnAddMember(Group* group, int guid) override\n    {\n        // Log\
      \ that a new member was added to the group\n        sLog->outString(\"New member\
      \ with GUID %d added to group %d\", guid, group->GetId());\n        \n     \
      \   // Perform custom logic here\n        // For example: initialize bot behavior\
      \ for new member\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called from within the TrinityCore core during group management
    operations. It's important to note that the Group pointer may be invalid if the
    group has been disbanded or deleted by the time this callback executes. The GUID
    parameter represents the player's unique identifier in the game world and should
    be used carefully to avoid referencing stale data.
  warnings: Developers must ensure thread safety when implementing this method, as
    it may be called from different threads during concurrent group operations. Avoid
    performing heavy computations or blocking operations within this callback to prevent
    performance degradation of group management functions.
