  class: BotAI
  method: SubscribeToEventBuses
  signature: void BotAI::SubscribeToEventBuses()
documentation:
  brief: Subscribes the bot AI to relevant event buses for handling game events and
    updates.
  description: The SubscribeToEventBuses method initializes the BotAI's event handling
    system by registering it with various event buses within the TrinityCore framework.
    This allows the bot to receive notifications about game events such as player
    actions, combat states, movement updates, and other relevant occurrences. The
    method ensures that the AI can respond appropriately to dynamic changes in the
    game environment. It is typically called during the bot's initialization phase
    to establish all necessary event subscriptions before the bot begins active gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Bot Initialization
    code: "void MyBot::Initialize()\n{\n    // Other initialization code...\n    SubscribeToEventBuses();\n\
      \    // Continue with bot setup\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the bot's lifecycle, typically
    after the bot has been fully constructed but before it begins active gameplay.
    The subscription process is not thread-safe and should be performed from the main
    game thread.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate event handlers
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that no other systems are already subscribed to
    the same events to prevent conflicts.
