  class: PolicyNetwork
  method: GetActionProbabilities
  signature: int PolicyNetwork::GetActionProbabilities(const int & state)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the probability distribution over possible actions
    for a given game state in the AI policy network.
  description: The GetActionProbabilities method computes the likelihood of each available
    action based on the current game state using the trained policy neural network.
    This method is typically used in reinforcement learning scenarios within World
    of Warcraft's AI systems to determine optimal player behaviors or NPC decision-making.
    The method takes a single integer representing the current state identifier and
    returns an integer code indicating success or failure of the probability calculation.
    It assumes that the policy network has been properly initialized and trained before
    calling this method.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: An integer identifier representing the current game state. This value
      is typically used as input to the neural network to compute action probabilities.
  returns: 'Returns an integer status code: 0 for successful computation of action
    probabilities, non-zero values indicate errors such as invalid state, untrained
    network, or computational failure.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "int currentState = player->GetAIState();\nint result = policyNetwork->GetActionProbabilities(currentState);\n\
      if (result == 0) {\n    // Action probabilities are now available for use\n\
      \    // Process the computed probabilities to select next action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error handling with state validation
    code: "int currentState = GetGameState();\nif (currentState >= 0) {\n    int status\
      \ = policyNetwork->GetActionProbabilities(currentState);\n    if (status !=\
      \ 0) {\n        // Handle error case\n        sLog->outError(\"Policy network\
      \ failed to compute action probabilities for state %d\", currentState);\n  \
      \  }\n} else {\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid game state: %d\", currentState);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a reinforcement learning framework and requires the
    policy network to be properly initialized with trained weights. The returned probabilities
    should be normalized before use in action selection algorithms. Performance may
    vary depending on the complexity of the neural network architecture used.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the policy network
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect probability calculations. Ensure
    that the state parameter represents a valid game state known to the AI system.
