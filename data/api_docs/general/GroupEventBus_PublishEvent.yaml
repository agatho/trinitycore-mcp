  class: GroupEventBus
  method: PublishEvent
  signature: bool GroupEventBus::PublishEvent(const GroupEvent & event)
documentation:
  brief: Publishes a group event to all registered subscribers in the event bus.
  description: The GroupEventBus::PublishEvent method dispatches a given GroupEvent
    to all registered listeners within the system. This mechanism enables asynchronous
    communication between different subsystems of the TrinityCore server, allowing
    components to react to group-related events such as member joins, leaves, or changes
    in group leadership. The method returns true if the event was successfully published
    to at least one subscriber, and false otherwise. It is typically used in the context
    of player group management and raid coordination within World of Warcraft's game
    mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: event
    description: The GroupEvent object containing the event data to be published.
      This includes information about the type of group event, affected players, and
      any relevant metadata.
  returns: True if the event was successfully delivered to one or more subscribers;
    false if no subscribers were registered or if delivery failed for all subscribers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Event Publishing
    code: "GroupEvent groupEvent;\n// Initialize groupEvent with appropriate data\n\
      bool result = groupEventBus.PublishEvent(groupEvent);\nif (result)\n{\n    //\
      \ Event was published successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Publishing a Group Member Leave Event
    code: "GroupEvent leaveEvent;\nleaveEvent.type = GroupEventType::MEMBER_LEAVE;\n\
      leaveEvent.playerGuid = playerGuid;\nleaveEvent.groupId = groupId;\nbool success\
      \ = groupEventBus.PublishEvent(leaveEvent);\nif (!success)\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ case where no subscribers received the event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
    It uses a lock-free mechanism internally for performance optimization, but may
    block briefly during event delivery if subscribers are processing events synchronously.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupEvent object passed to this method is fully initialized
    before publishing, as incomplete or invalid data could lead to unexpected behavior
    in subscribers. Avoid calling this method recursively from within a subscriber's
    event handler to prevent potential deadlocks.
