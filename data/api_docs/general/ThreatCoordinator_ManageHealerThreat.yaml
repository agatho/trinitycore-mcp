documentation:
  brief: Manages threat generation and distribution for healer units within the threat
    coordination system.
  description: The ManageHealerThreat method is responsible for handling the behavior
    of healers in relation to threat management. It ensures that healers properly
    generate and distribute threat to maintain proper tanking dynamics, particularly
    when healing targets that are under attack. This method likely adjusts the threat
    values of healers based on their healing actions, target selection, and combat
    state. The system may prevent healers from gaining excessive threat while still
    ensuring they can effectively support the tank without disrupting the overall
    combat flow.

  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when healer actions
    are processed. It's part of the broader threat coordination system that helps
    maintain balanced gameplay between tanks and healers.
