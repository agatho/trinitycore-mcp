  method: LogDetailedHealthStatus
  signature: void BotHealthCheck::LogDetailedHealthStatus() const
documentation:
  brief: Logs detailed health status information for bot entities within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  description: The LogDetailedHealthStatus method outputs comprehensive health-related
    data for all active bot characters managed by the system. This includes current
    hit points, maximum hit points, health percentages, and any relevant combat state
    indicators. The method is typically invoked during debugging sessions or performance
    monitoring to assess the overall vitality and operational status of automated
    player characters (bots). It does not modify any internal state but serves purely
    for diagnostic purposes. The output is directed to the logging subsystem, making
    it useful for developers and administrators who need to monitor bot behavior in
    real-time.

  - title: Basic Usage in Debug Context
    code: 'BotHealthCheck healthChecker;

      healthChecker.LogDetailedHealthStatus();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal bot state tracking mechanisms and should only
    be called when bots are initialized and active. It may have performance implications
    if invoked too frequently in high-frequency scenarios due to logging overhead.
  warnings: Ensure that the logging level is appropriately configured before calling
    this method, as excessive output can clutter logs and impact system performance.
    Avoid using this method in production environments without proper log filtering.
