  class: Creature
  method: UpdateStats
  signature: bool Creature::UpdateStats(int stat)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the specified creature's statistics including health, mana, and other
    combat-related attributes.
  description: The UpdateStats method recalculates and applies updated statistical
    values for a Creature object, typically in response to changes in its state or
    level. This method ensures that the creature's current stats such as health points,
    mana, attack power, and defense metrics are properly synchronized with its base
    values and any modifiers. It is commonly invoked during creature creation, level
    ups, or when stat-modifying effects are applied or removed. The method returns
    true if the update was successful, false otherwise. This function plays a crucial
    role in maintaining game balance and ensuring that creatures behave according
    to their intended stats within the World of Warcraft mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: stat
    description: The specific stat index to update. Valid values are typically defined
      by the CreatureStat enum or similar system, representing different attributes
      like HEALTH, MANA, AGILITY, STRENGTH, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the statistics were successfully updated for the specified
    stat, false if the update failed or if an invalid stat index was provided.
  examples:
  - title: Update all creature stats after level up
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\n// Update all stats\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_CREATURE_STATS;\
      \ ++i)\n{\n    if (!creature->UpdateStats(i))\n    {\n        // Handle error\n\
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Update specific stat after buff application
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\n// Update only health stat after a healing effect\n\
      if (creature->UpdateStats(STAT_HEALTH))\n{\n    // Stat update successful, notify\
      \ players\n    creature->SendUpdateToPlayer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger additional recalculations of derived stats such as
    damage output or armor values. It's important to note that calling UpdateStats
    with an invalid stat index might lead to undefined behavior or silent failures.
    The method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections of code,
    as it may involve multiple calculations and updates.
  warnings: Calling this method frequently without proper validation can cause performance
    degradation. Ensure the stat parameter is within valid bounds before calling to
    avoid potential crashes or incorrect behavior. This function modifies internal
    creature state and should not be called from within critical sections where race
    conditions might occur.
