  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: IncrementBracket
  signature: void BotLevelDistribution::IncrementBracket(uint32 level, int faction)
documentation:
  brief: Increments the bot level distribution bracket for the specified level and
    faction.
  description: The IncrementBracket method updates the internal tracking of bot deployments
    by increasing the count for a specific level and faction combination. This method
    is typically used in the context of bot management systems within TrinityCore
    to maintain statistics on how many bots of a given level exist for each faction.
    The method modifies an internal data structure that tracks these distributions,
    likely used for balancing or generating appropriate bot encounters based on player
    levels and factions.
  parameters:
  - name: level
    description: The level of the bot whose bracket count should be incremented. Must
      be a valid positive integer representing a bot's level.
  - name: faction
    description: The faction identifier of the bot whose bracket count should be incremented.
      Valid values correspond to faction IDs used in World of Warcraft (e.g., 1 for
      Alliance, 2 for Horde).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Incrementing a Bot Bracket
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution distribution;

      distribution.IncrementBracket(10, 1); // Increments the count for level 10 Alliance
      bots'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal hash map or similar data structure
    to track bot counts by level and faction. It is assumed that this class maintains
    a thread-safe state if used in multi-threaded environments.
