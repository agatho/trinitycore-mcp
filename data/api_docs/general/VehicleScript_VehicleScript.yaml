  signature: void VehicleScript::VehicleScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new VehicleScript instance with the specified name.
  description: The VehicleScript constructor initializes a new vehicle script instance,
    associating it with a unique name identifier. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to register custom vehicle behavior scripts. The name
    parameter serves as a lookup key for the script system and must be unique to avoid
    conflicts. Vehicle scripts are responsible for handling vehicle-specific game
    mechanics such as passenger management, vehicle movement, and interaction with
    the vehicle's parent GameObject. This constructor sets up internal data structures
    required for the script to function within the TrinityCore scripting system.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated string that uniquely identifies this vehicle script.
      The name is used by the script system to register and retrieve the script instance.
      Must be unique across all registered scripts to prevent conflicts.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic VehicleScript Initialization
    code: "class MyVehicleScript : public VehicleScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyVehicleScript()\
      \ : VehicleScript(\"MyCustomVehicleScript\") {}\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: VehicleScript with Custom Logic
    code: "class DragonVehicleScript : public VehicleScript\n{\npublic:\n    DragonVehicleScript()\
      \ : VehicleScript(\"DragonVehicle\")\n    {\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ logic can be added here\n    }\n\n    void OnInstall(Vehicle* vehicle) override\n\
      \    {\n        // Custom installation logic\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The VehicleScript constructor should only be called during class initialization
    or when dynamically registering new vehicle scripts. The name parameter is case-sensitive
    and must not contain special characters that could interfere with the script registry
    system. This constructor does not perform any validation on the provided name,
    so it's recommended to validate names before passing them to ensure proper registration.
  warnings: Passing a null or empty string as the name parameter may cause issues
    with script registration and lookup. Avoid using names that conflict with existing
    built-in vehicle scripts in TrinityCore. The VehicleScript constructor does not
    automatically register itself with the script manager; explicit registration is
    required through the ScriptMgr system.
