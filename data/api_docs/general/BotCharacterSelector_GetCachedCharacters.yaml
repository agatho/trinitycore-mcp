  signature: int BotCharacterSelector::GetCachedCharacters(uint32 accountId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of cached bot characters associated with a given account
    ID.
  description: The GetCachedCharacters method returns the number of bot characters
    that have been cached for a specific account. This method is typically used within
    the TrinityCore framework to manage and query bot character data without directly
    accessing the database. The caching mechanism helps optimize performance by reducing
    redundant database queries. The method takes an account ID as input and provides
    a count of all bot characters linked to that account in the cache.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account for which cached bot characters
      are being retrieved. Must be a valid, non-zero account ID.
  returns: An integer representing the number of cached bot characters associated
    with the specified account ID. Returns zero if no characters are cached or if
    the account ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = 12345;\nint characterCount = selector->GetCachedCharacters(accountId);\n\
      if (characterCount > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Found \" << characterCount <<\
      \ \" cached bot characters for account \" << accountId << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"No cached bot characters found for account \" << accountId\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void UpdateBotCharacterCache(uint32 accountId)\
      \ {\n        int cachedCount = botSelector->GetCachedCharacters(accountId);\n\
      \        if (cachedCount == 0) {\n            // Trigger cache refresh\n   \
      \         RefreshCharacterCache(accountId);\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached data, so it reflects the state of the in-memory
    cache rather than the database. The cache may not be synchronized with the actual
    database contents if changes occur outside of the bot system's control. This method
    is thread-safe as long as the underlying cache implementation supports concurrent
    access.
  warnings: The returned count only includes characters that are currently cached.
    If the cache has expired or was not populated, this value might be inaccurate.
    Always ensure that the account ID provided is valid to avoid unexpected behavior.
