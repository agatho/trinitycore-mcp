  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CalculateRoleSynergy
  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateRoleSynergy(Player * player, GroupRole
    role, Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the synergy score for a player's role within a group based on
    team composition and player attributes.
  description: The CalculateRoleSynergy method evaluates how well a player's assigned
    role fits within the context of their current group. It takes into account various
    factors such as the player's class, specialization, gear level, and the overall
    makeup of the group to determine an effectiveness multiplier. This synergy score
    is used internally by TrinityCore to optimize group assignments, loot distribution,
    and encounter difficulty scaling. The method requires a valid player object and
    group context to perform calculations, returning a float value that represents
    the normalized synergy between the player's role and their group's needs.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose role synergy is being calculated.
      Must be a valid player with an active session and group membership.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value representing the player's assigned role
      within the group (e.g., TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE).
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the player and other group
      members. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0f and 1.0f representing the calculated
    synergy score. A value of 1.0f indicates perfect role synergy, while values closer
    to 0.0f indicate poor fit or redundancy in the group's composition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float synergy = roleAssignment->CalculateRoleSynergy(player, GROUP_ROLE_TANK,\
      \ player->GetGroup());\nif (synergy > 0.8f) {\n    // Player is well-suited\
      \ for their assigned tank role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Synergy-Based Role Optimization
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && group->IsLeader(player))\
      \ {\n    float currentSynergy = roleAssignment->CalculateRoleSynergy(player,\
      \ player->GetRole(), group);\n    // Adjust role assignment if synergy is low\n\
      \    if (currentSynergy < 0.5f) {\n        // Consider reassigning role for\
      \ better group balance\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal calculations involving player statistics, group
    composition analysis, and role balancing algorithms. It may be computationally
    expensive when called frequently on large groups. The synergy score is not cached
    and will be recalculated each time the method is invoked.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and group parameters are valid before calling
    this method to avoid segmentation faults. Calling with a null player or group
    pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
