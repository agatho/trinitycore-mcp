documentation:
  brief: Records profiling data for the current scoped profiler instance.
  description: The RecordProfile method is used to capture and store performance profiling
    information for a specific scope within the TrinityCore framework. This method
    typically records timing data, memory usage, or other diagnostic metrics associated
    with the duration of execution within a given code block. It is commonly used
    in conjunction with scoped profiling mechanisms to measure the performance impact
    of specific operations or subsystems. The method does not take any parameters
    and does not return a value, serving purely as a data recording mechanism. This
    functionality is crucial for developers to identify performance bottlenecks and
    optimize game systems.

  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Profiling
    code: "void SomeGameFunction()\n{\n    ScopedProfiler profiler(\"SomeGameFunction\"\
      );\n    // ... perform some operations ...\n    profiler.RecordProfile(); //\
      \ Records the profiling data\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the ScopedProfiler destructor
    when the scope ends, but can also be manually invoked to record intermediate profiling
    points. It's important to ensure that profiling data is recorded in a thread-safe
    manner if used across multiple threads.
