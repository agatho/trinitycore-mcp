  signature: void MovementArbiter::LogRequest(const MovementRequest & request, const
    std::string & action) const
documentation:
  brief: Logs a movement request with associated action for debugging and tracking
    purposes.
  description: The LogRequest method records details about a movement request, including
    the request data and the action being performed. This functionality is typically
    used for debugging, monitoring, or auditing movement-related activities within
    the TrinityCore server. The method does not modify the request itself but instead
    outputs diagnostic information to the log system. It is commonly invoked when
    processing player movement commands or AI-driven movement decisions to maintain
    a traceable history of movement operations.
  parameters:
  - name: request
    description: The MovementRequest object containing details about the movement
      operation to be logged.
  - name: action
    description: A string describing the action being performed, such as 'Move', 'Teleport',
      or 'Pathfinding'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Logging of Movement Request
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      // ... populate request with movement data ...

      MovementArbiter arbiter;

      arbiter.LogRequest(request, "Player Movement");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging AI Movement Decision
    code: 'MovementRequest aiRequest;

      aiRequest.movementType = MovementType::PATHFINDING;

      aiRequest.targetPosition = {100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f};

      MovementArbiter arbiter;

      arbiter.LogRequest(aiRequest, "AI Pathfinding Initiated");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical paths. The actual logging behavior depends
    on the server's log level configuration. It may be disabled or optimized based
    on build flags or runtime settings.
  warnings: Ensure that sensitive movement data isn't inadvertently logged in production
    environments. The method assumes valid input parameters; invalid requests might
    cause undefined behavior if not properly validated before calling.
