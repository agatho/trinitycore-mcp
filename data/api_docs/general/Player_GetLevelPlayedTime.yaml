documentation:
  brief: Returns the total time a player has spent at their current level.
  description: This method retrieves the total play time in seconds that the player
    has spent at their current level. It is used to track how long a player has been
    at their present level, which can be useful for various game mechanics including
    experience calculations, level-based rewards, and player progression tracking.
    The value returned represents the accumulated time since the player last leveled
    up, and is typically used in conjunction with other player statistics to determine
    overall gameplay duration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the total seconds the player has spent at
    their current level. This value can be zero if the player just leveled up or has
    not played long enough to accumulate any significant time.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 playTime = player->GetLevelPlayedTime();

      std::cout << "Player has been at level " << player->GetLevel() << " for " <<
      playTime << " seconds." << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with GetLevel() to determine
    the total time spent at a specific level. It may be affected by game mechanics
    such as level-up events or player activity changes, and should be used carefully
    when calculating experience or rewards.
  warnings: This method does not account for time spent in instances or zones that
    might affect gameplay duration; it only returns the time spent at current level.
    Be cautious when using this value for reward calculations as it may not reflect
    actual gameplay time.
