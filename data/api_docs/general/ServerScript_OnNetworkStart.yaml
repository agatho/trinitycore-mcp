documentation:
  brief: Initializes network-related subsystems when the server starts up
  description: The OnNetworkStart method is a callback function that gets invoked
    during the server's initialization phase, specifically when network services are
    being set up. This method allows developers to perform any necessary setup or
    configuration of network-related components before the server begins accepting
    connections from clients. It serves as an entry point for custom network initialization
    logic within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Network Initialization
    code: "class MyServerScript : public ServerScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnNetworkStart()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Initialize custom network components\n       \
      \ LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Custom network subsystem initialized\");\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called once during server startup, before any client connections
    are accepted. It should be used for lightweight initialization only; heavy operations
    may delay server startup.
  warnings: Avoid performing blocking operations or extensive computations in this
    method as it can delay server startup and affect overall performance.
