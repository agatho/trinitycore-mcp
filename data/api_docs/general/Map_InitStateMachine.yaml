  method: InitStateMachine
  signature: void Map::InitStateMachine()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the state machine for the map, setting up internal game loop
    and event handling mechanisms.
  description: The InitStateMachine method initializes the state machine responsible
    for managing the map's operational states and event processing. This method is
    typically called during map creation or loading to establish the necessary infrastructure
    for handling game events, player interactions, and world updates. It sets up internal
    data structures and registers callbacks required for the map's lifecycle management.
    The initialization process ensures that the map can properly respond to various
    game events such as player entry/exit, object updates, and time-based triggers.
    This method should only be called once per map instance during its initialization
    phase.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Initialization
    code: 'Map* myMap = new Map();

      myMap->InitStateMachine();

      // Map is now ready to handle game events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any other map operations. It's typically
    invoked internally by the core engine during map loading, but may also be called
    explicitly in custom implementations. The state machine initialization is critical
    for proper map functionality and should not be skipped or called multiple times.
  warnings: Calling InitStateMachine multiple times on the same map instance can lead
    to undefined behavior or memory leaks. This method must be called before any gameplay
    operations on the map begin. Avoid calling this method on maps that are already
    active or in use.
