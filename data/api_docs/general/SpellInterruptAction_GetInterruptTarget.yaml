  class: SpellInterruptAction
  method: GetInterruptTarget
  signature: ::Unit * SpellInterruptAction::GetInterruptTarget(BotAI * ai, int targetGuid)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the target unit that a spell interrupt action should be applied
    to.
  description: The GetInterruptTarget method is used within the BotAI framework to
    determine which Unit should be targeted for a spell interruption. This method
    takes a BotAI instance and a target GUID as parameters, and returns a pointer
    to the corresponding Unit object. It is typically invoked during spell casting
    or interrupt logic where the AI needs to identify a valid unit to interrupt. The
    method relies on the internal state of the BotAI to resolve the GUID into an actual
    game object. This functionality is crucial for proper AI behavior when dealing
    with spell interruption mechanics in TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that manages the bot's behavior and
      state. Used to access the AI's internal data structures and methods.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to be interrupted.
      This GUID corresponds to a specific game object in the world, typically representing
      an enemy or ally that is casting a spell.
  returns: Pointer to the Unit object corresponding to the provided targetGuid. Returns
    nullptr if no valid unit can be found for the given GUID, indicating that the
    target is either invalid, out of scope, or not currently present in the game world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spell interrupt logic
    code: "Unit* target = interruptAction.GetInterruptTarget(ai, targetGuid);\nif\
      \ (target && target->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Proceed with interrupting the target's\
      \ spell\n    ai->GetSpellHistory()->InterruptCurrentSpell(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe handling of potential null return
    code: "Unit* target = interruptAction.GetInterruptTarget(ai, targetGuid);\nif\
      \ (!target) {\n    // Handle case where target is invalid or not found\n   \
      \ ai->GetBot()->Say(\"Invalid target for spell interrupt.\");\n    return;\n\
      }\n// Proceed with valid target\nai->GetSpellHistory()->InterruptSpell(target);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance has proper access to the game
    world and can resolve GUIDs to Unit objects. It may perform internal lookups or
    caching operations, so repeated calls with the same parameters might be optimized
    by the AI framework. The returned Unit pointer is only valid while the target
    unit remains in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetGuid parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    unit in the game world before calling this method. Failure to check for null returns
    may lead to crashes or undefined behavior when attempting to access properties
    of a non-existent unit.
