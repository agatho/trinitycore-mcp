  method: InitializeQueryData
  signature: void CreatureTemplate::InitializeQueryData()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes query data for the creature template, setting up internal structures
    for database queries.
  description: The InitializeQueryData method prepares and initializes internal query
    structures for a CreatureTemplate object. This method is typically called during
    the loading phase of creature templates to ensure that all necessary database
    query components are properly set up. It handles the preparation of SQL statements
    and result handling mechanisms required for fetching creature template data from
    the database. The method ensures that subsequent queries can efficiently retrieve
    and process creature template information without requiring repeated setup operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'CreatureTemplate* creatureTemplate = new CreatureTemplate();

      creatureTemplate->InitializeQueryData();

      // Template is now ready for database queries'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a CreatureTemplate object. Repeated calls may lead to undefined behavior or resource
    leaks. The method assumes that the database connection and necessary schema are
    already established.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the creature template has been fully initialized
    with data, as it may overwrite existing query structures. This method is typically
    an internal implementation detail and should not be called directly by external
    code unless specifically required for advanced customization.
