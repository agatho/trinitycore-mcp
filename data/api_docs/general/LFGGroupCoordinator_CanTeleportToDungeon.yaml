  method: CanTeleportToDungeon
  signature: bool LFGGroupCoordinator::CanTeleportToDungeon(const Player * player,
    uint32 dungeonId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player can be teleported to a specified dungeon.
  description: The CanTeleportToDungeon method determines if a given player is eligible
    to be teleported to a specific dungeon instance. This check typically involves
    verifying that the player meets prerequisites such as level requirements, quest
    completion, and LFG (Looking For Group) group status. The method ensures that
    teleportation logic aligns with game rules and prevents invalid or unauthorized
    dungeon access. It is commonly used within the LFG system to validate player eligibility
    before initiating teleportation sequences.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character attempting
      to teleport. Must not be null.
  - name: dungeonId
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon instance. Represents the specific
      dungeon the player is trying to enter.
  returns: Returns true if the player can be teleported to the specified dungeon,
    false otherwise. The method evaluates various conditions including level restrictions,
    quest prerequisites, and group membership status.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (LFGGroupCoordinator::CanTeleportToDungeon(player, 1234)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with teleportation logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration in LFG System
    code: "void HandleLfgTeleport(Player* player, uint32 dungeonId) {\n    if (LFGGroupCoordinator::CanTeleportToDungeon(player,\
      \ dungeonId)) {\n        // Initiate teleportation to dungeon\n        player->TeleportToDungeon(dungeonId);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Notify player that they cannot enter the dungeon\n\
      \        player->SendLfgTeleportError(LFG_TELEPORT_ERROR_INVALID);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG (Looking For Group) subsystem and integrates
    with TrinityCore's dungeon queue and teleportation systems. It relies on internal
    state tracking for player eligibility, including cooldowns, group composition,
    and quest progress. The method does not perform actual teleportation but only
    validates whether it's permissible.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to
    avoid crashes. The dungeonId must correspond to a valid dungeon entry in the database
    or else behavior may be undefined. This method should not be used as a standalone
    validation for teleportation without additional checks like group leader status
    or instance locks.
