  class: WildfireBombManager
  method: HasCharge
  signature: bool WildfireBombManager::HasCharge() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the WildfireBombManager has an active charge available for
    use.
  description: The HasCharge method determines if the WildfireBombManager currently
    holds a usable charge. This is typically used in the context of abilities or spells
    that require a resource or cooldown to be consumed before activation. The method
    returns true if there is at least one charge available, and false otherwise. It's
    commonly used in conjunction with other methods like UseCharge() or GetCharges()
    to manage ability usage within game mechanics such as those found in the Warlock
    class's Wildfire Bomb spell.
  parameters: []
  returns: A boolean value indicating whether a charge is available. Returns true
    if there is at least one charge, false if no charges are currently available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (wildfireBombManager.HasCharge()) {\n    // Proceed with using the charge\n\
      \    wildfireBombManager.UseCharge();\n} else {\n    // Handle case where no\
      \ charge is available\n    SendChatMessage(\"No charges remaining.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not modify the internal state of the manager; it only performs
    a read operation. It should be used before attempting to consume a charge to avoid
    invalid operations.
