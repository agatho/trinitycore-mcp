  method: SummonPet
  signature: bool WarlockAI::SummonPet()
documentation:
  brief: Summons the warlock's pet if conditions are met and returns true on success.
  description: The SummonPet method attempts to summon the warlock's summoned pet,
    typically a voidwalker, felhunter, or imp, based on the player's current pet state
    and available summoning resources. It checks whether the pet is already active,
    whether the player has sufficient mana or soul shards, and whether the summoning
    spell is available. If all conditions are satisfied, it triggers the pet summoning
    process and returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This method is typically
    invoked by the AI system during combat or when the warlock needs to deploy their
    summoned companion.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the pet was successfully summoned or is already active,
    false if summoning failed due to resource constraints, invalid state, or other
    conditions preventing summoning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (warlockAI->SummonPet()) {\n    // Pet has been summoned or was already\
      \ active\n    // Proceed with combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Summoning with Resource Check
    code: "if (!player->HasPet() && player->GetPower(POWER_SOUL_SHARDS) >= 1) {\n\
      \    if (warlockAI->SummonPet()) {\n        // Successfully summoned pet\n \
      \       warlockAI->SetCurrentTarget(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying AI state management and assumes that
    the WarlockAI instance is properly initialized with a valid player context. The
    actual summoning behavior may vary depending on the warlock's specialization (e.g.,
    Affliction, Demonology, Destruction) and active talents.
  warnings: Ensure that the player object associated with the WarlockAI has sufficient
    resources before calling this method to avoid silent failures. Failure to check
    pet state or resource availability can lead to incorrect AI behavior or failed
    summoning attempts.
