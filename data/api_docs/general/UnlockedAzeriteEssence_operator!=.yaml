  method: operator!=
  signature: bool UnlockedAzeriteEssence::operator!=(const UnlockedAzeriteEssence
    & right) const
documentation:
  brief: Compares two UnlockedAzeriteEssence objects for inequality.
  description: The operator!= method performs a comparison between this UnlockedAzeriteEssence
    object and another UnlockedAzeriteEssence object to determine if they are not
    equal. This comparison is typically based on the internal state or properties
    of the essence, such as its ID, level, or unlocked status. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's Azerite system, this method allows developers to check whether two
    unlocked azerite essences represent different types or levels of azerite. The
    operation is const and does not modify either object. This operator is commonly
    used in conditional logic, container comparisons, or when implementing custom
    sorting or filtering behavior for azerite essences.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The UnlockedAzeriteEssence object to compare against this instance.
  returns: Returns true if the two UnlockedAzeriteEssence objects are not equal, false
    otherwise. The comparison is based on the internal properties of each essence,
    such as their identifiers or unlocked state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Inequality Check
    code: "UnlockedAzeriteEssence essence1;\nUnlockedAzeriteEssence essence2;\n\n\
      if (essence1 != essence2) {\n    std::cout << \"The essences are different.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"The essences are the same.\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Container Filtering
    code: "std::vector<UnlockedAzeriteEssence> essences;\nUnlockedAzeriteEssence target;\n\
      \nauto it = std::find_if(essences.begin(), essences.end(),\n    [&target](const\
      \ UnlockedAzeriteEssence& e) {\n        return e != target; // Find first essence\
      \ that is not equal to target\n    });"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is likely implemented using a member-wise comparison of key
    properties such as the essence ID, level, or unlocked flags. It's important to
    note that this comparison may be performance-sensitive if used in tight loops
    or large collections, especially when dealing with many azerite essences.
  warnings: Be cautious when relying on operator!= for complex logic involving azerite
    essences. Ensure the underlying equality implementation is consistent and predictable,
    particularly if custom comparison logic has been added to the class.
