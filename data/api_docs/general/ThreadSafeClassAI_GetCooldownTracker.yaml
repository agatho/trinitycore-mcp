  method: GetCooldownTracker
  signature: CooldownTracker & ThreadSafeClassAI::GetCooldownTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the cooldown tracker associated with this AI instance.
  description: The GetCooldownTracker method provides access to the CooldownTracker
    object that manages ability and spell cooldowns for the AI-controlled unit. This
    tracker is essential for implementing proper cooldown handling in AI behavior
    logic, ensuring abilities are not used before their cooldown periods expire. The
    returned reference allows direct manipulation of cooldown states, including setting,
    resetting, or checking cooldown durations. This method is typically called during
    AI update cycles or when processing ability usage to maintain game balance and
    realistic behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the CooldownTracker object associated with this ThreadSafeClassAI
    instance. The reference remains valid for the lifetime of the AI object and can
    be used to query or modify cooldown states.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an ability is on cooldown
    code: "if (ai->GetCooldownTracker().IsOnCooldown(SPELL_FIREBALL)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ cooldown logic\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting a custom cooldown duration
    code: 'CooldownTracker& tracker = ai->GetCooldownTracker();

      tracker.SetCooldown(SPELL_BLINK, 3000); // 3 second cooldown

      // AI logic continues...'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal CooldownTracker object that
    is managed by the ThreadSafeClassAI instance. The returned reference should not
    be stored beyond the scope of the current function call unless you are certain
    about the lifetime of the AI object. This method is thread-safe as indicated by
    the class name, but direct manipulation of cooldowns from multiple threads should
    still be coordinated to prevent race conditions.
  warnings: Modifying cooldown states directly through this reference can affect AI
    behavior unpredictably if not handled carefully. Always ensure that cooldown changes
    align with game balance requirements and do not create exploits or unrealistic
    behavior. Avoid modifying cooldowns during critical AI processing phases where
    consistency is required.
