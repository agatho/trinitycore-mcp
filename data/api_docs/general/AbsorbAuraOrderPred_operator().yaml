documentation:
  brief: Compares two aura effects for ordering based on absorb priority.
  description: The operator() method of AbsorbAuraOrderPred is a predicate used to
    sort aura effects in descending order of their absorb priority. This comparison
    function is typically used within the TrinityCore framework when processing absorb
    effects from multiple auras, ensuring that higher-priority absorbs are applied
    first. The sorting mechanism helps determine which absorb effect should take precedence
    when multiple absorbs are active on a target, particularly relevant during combat
    scenarios where damage absorption is critical. This method does not modify any
    state and serves purely as a comparison utility for sorting containers of AuraEffect
    pointers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if aurEffA has higher absorb priority than aurEffB, false
    otherwise. This determines the ordering in which aura effects are processed during
    absorb calculations.
  examples:
  - title: Sorting Aura Effects by Absorb Priority
    code: 'std::vector<AuraEffect*> auraEffects;

      // ... populate auraEffects with various aura effects ...

      std::sort(auraEffects.begin(), auraEffects.end(), AbsorbAuraOrderPred());

      // Now auraEffects is sorted with highest priority absorbs first'
    language: cpp
  notes: This predicate assumes that AuraEffect objects have valid absorb priority
    values set. The implementation relies on internal aura effect properties and should
    only be used with properly initialized aura effects. Performance is O(1) for each
    comparison operation.
  warnings: Do not use this predicate with uninitialized or invalid AuraEffect pointers
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure all aura effects passed to this comparator
    have been properly initialized with valid absorb data before sorting.
