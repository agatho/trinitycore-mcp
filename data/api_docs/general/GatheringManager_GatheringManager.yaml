  class: GatheringManager
  method: GatheringManager
  signature: void GatheringManager::GatheringManager(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a GatheringManager instance with the specified player and AI
    components.
  description: The GatheringManager constructor initializes a new gathering manager
    instance for a bot player, associating it with the provided BotAI instance. This
    method sets up the necessary internal state for managing resource gathering behaviors
    and decisions for the bot. The initialization process typically involves setting
    up data structures to track gathered resources, configuring behavior parameters,
    and establishing communication channels with the AI system. It is designed to
    be called during bot creation or activation phases when the bot needs to perform
    gathering operations within the World of Warcraft environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will use this
      gathering manager. Must not be null and should represent a valid bot character
      in the game world.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object that controls the behavior of the bot.
      This AI instance provides decision-making capabilities for gathering operations
      and must be properly initialized before this constructor is called.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GatheringManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player object

      BotAI* myAI = ...;     // AI controller object

      GatheringManager manager(myBot, myAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing GatheringManager in Bot Creation Context
    code: "class MyBot : public Player {\npublic:\n    void InitializeGathering()\n\
      \    {\n        // Assuming we have access to AI instance\n        GatheringManager*\
      \ gatherMgr = new GatheringManager(this, m_AI);\n        // Further initialization\
      \ logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance during its initialization
    phase. The manager assumes that both the player and AI objects remain valid for
    the lifetime of the GatheringManager. It is recommended to initialize the AI component
    before creating the GatheringManager to ensure proper behavior setup.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor with null pointers as it may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object represents an actual bot character,
    not a regular player. The manager does not perform any validation on the input
    parameters beyond basic null checks.
