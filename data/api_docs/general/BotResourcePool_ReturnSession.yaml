  class: BotResourcePool
  method: ReturnSession
  signature: void BotResourcePool::ReturnSession(int botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Returns a bot session to the resource pool, making it available for reuse
    by other bots.
  description: The ReturnSession method is responsible for releasing a bot session
    back into the BotResourcePool, allowing the system to reclaim and redistribute
    that session for use by other bots. This method typically handles cleanup operations
    such as resetting the bot's state, clearing any temporary data, and updating internal
    tracking structures to mark the session as available. It plays a crucial role
    in resource management within TrinityCore's bot framework, ensuring efficient
    utilization of bot sessions without unnecessary overhead or resource leaks. The
    method assumes that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active session that
    was previously acquired via GetSession().
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose session is being returned
      to the pool. This must correspond to a valid bot that has an active session
      in the resource pool.
  returns: None. This method does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotResourcePool pool;

      // Assume we have a bot with GUID 12345

      pool.ReturnSession(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Lifecycle Management
    code: "class BotManager {\npublic:\n    void HandleBotCompletion(uint32 botGuid)\
      \ {\n        // Perform cleanup tasks specific to the bot\n        CleanupBotData(botGuid);\n\
      \        \n        // Return session to pool for reuse\n        resourcePool.ReturnSession(botGuid);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after a bot session has been properly initialized
    and used. It is recommended that developers verify the existence of the bot session
    before calling this method to avoid potential errors or undefined behavior. The
    implementation may involve locking mechanisms if thread safety is required.
  warnings: Calling ReturnSession with an invalid or non-existent botGuid can lead
    to undefined behavior or resource corruption. Always ensure that the bot GUID
    corresponds to a valid and active session before invoking this method.
