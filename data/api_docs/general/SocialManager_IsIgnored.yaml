  method: IsIgnored
  signature: bool SocialManager::IsIgnored(int playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player is ignored by the current user.
  description: The IsIgnored method determines if a specified player is on the current
    user's ignore list. This functionality is part of the social system in TrinityCore,
    which manages player relationships including ignores, friends, and blocks. The
    method takes a player GUID as input and returns true if that player is ignored,
    false otherwise. It's commonly used in chat systems to prevent messages from ignored
    players from being displayed or processed.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The globally unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check against
      the ignore list. This should be a valid player GUID obtained from the game database
      or player session.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is on the current user's ignore list,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a player is ignored
    code: "if (socialManager.IsIgnored(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is ignored, do\
      \ not process their messages\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using IsIgnored in a chat filtering system
    code: "void HandlePlayerMessage(Player* sender, std::string message) {\n    if\
      \ (socialManager.IsIgnored(sender->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n        // Silently\
      \ drop the message\n        return;\n    }\n    // Process and send message\
      \ normally\n    SendChatMessage(message);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the current user's social data. It does not perform
    any database queries directly but relies on cached or in-memory data structures
    that represent the ignore list. The implementation may vary depending on how the
    SocialManager is initialized and updated with player data.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter is valid and represents an actual
    player in the game world. Passing invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. This method should only be called when the social manager
    has been properly initialized with the current user's data.
