  class: PlayerbotMigrationMgr
  method: LogMigrationError
  signature: void PlayerbotMigrationMgr::LogMigrationError(const std::string & version,
    const std::string & error)
documentation:
  brief: Logs a migration error with associated version information to the system's
    error log.
  description: The LogMigrationError method records migration-related errors that
    occur during player bot data migration processes in TrinityCore. It takes a version
    string indicating the target version and an error message describing what went
    wrong. This method is typically used by the PlayerbotMigrationMgr class to track
    issues during automated migration procedures, helping developers diagnose problems
    when upgrading or migrating player bot configurations between different versions
    of the core. The logged errors are usually written to the server's log files for
    debugging purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: version
    description: The version string representing the target version where migration
      failed. This typically corresponds to the TrinityCore version or player bot
      configuration version being migrated to.
  - name: error
    description: A descriptive error message explaining what went wrong during the
      migration process. This should contain sufficient detail for developers to understand
      and resolve the issue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Logging
    code: PlayerbotMigrationMgr::LogMigrationError("3.3.5a", "Failed to migrate player
      bot AI configuration due to missing data field");
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Migration Failure with Version Context
    code: 'std::string version = "4.3.4";

      std::string error = "Cannot find required spell database entry for bot class:
      Warrior";

      PlayerbotMigrationMgr::LogMigrationError(version, error);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses the TrinityCore logging system to write messages
    to the server's log files. It is part of a larger migration framework that handles
    player bot data consistency across version upgrades. The method does not throw
    exceptions but may silently fail if logging infrastructure is not properly initialized.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid strings before calling this method,
    as malformed input could result in corrupted log entries. This method should only
    be called during active migration operations to avoid cluttering logs with irrelevant
    errors.
