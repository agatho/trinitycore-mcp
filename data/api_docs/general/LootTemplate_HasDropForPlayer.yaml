  signature: bool LootTemplate::HasDropForPlayer(const Player * player, uint8 groupId,
    bool strictUsabilityCheck) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has any loot drops available in the specified group.
  description: The HasDropForPlayer method determines whether a specific player is
    eligible to receive loot from a particular group within the loot template. This
    check considers the player's eligibility based on item requirements, quest status,
    and other conditions defined in the loot template. The method performs a strict
    usability check by default, ensuring that the player meets all necessary criteria
    for obtaining the loot. It is commonly used during loot distribution to filter
    out items that a player cannot acquire due to class restrictions, quest prerequisites,
    or other game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose eligibility for loot is being
      checked. Must not be null.
  - name: groupId
    description: The group ID within the loot template to check for player eligibility.
      Group IDs are used to organize loot into categories such as 'Loot', 'Quest',
      or 'Reference'.
  - name: strictUsabilityCheck
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to perform a strict usability check.
      When true, the method verifies all conditions including class restrictions,
      quest requirements, and item usability. When false, only basic eligibility is
      checked.
  returns: Returns true if the player has at least one eligible drop in the specified
    group; otherwise returns false. This indicates that the player can potentially
    receive loot from this group.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (lootTemplate->HasDropForPlayer(player, 1, true)) {\n    // Player has\
      \ eligible drops in group 1\n    // Proceed with loot distribution logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Loot Distribution
    code: "uint8 groupId = 2;\nif (lootTemplate->HasDropForPlayer(player, groupId,\
      \ false)) {\n    // Player has potential drops in group 2 without strict checks\n\
      \    // Can proceed with loot generation for this group\n} else {\n    // No\
      \ eligible drops found, skip group processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the loot distribution process before
    attempting to give items to players. It helps optimize performance by avoiding
    unnecessary item creation or distribution for ineligible players. The strictUsabilityCheck
    parameter allows developers to control how strictly eligibility is enforced, which
    can be useful when pre-checking groups before actual distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing a null player pointer will result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    Also note that this method does not perform actual loot distribution; it only
    checks eligibility.
