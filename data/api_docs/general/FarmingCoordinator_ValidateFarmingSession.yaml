  signature: bool FarmingCoordinator::ValidateFarmingSession(int * player, const FarmingSession
    & session) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates a farming session for a player, ensuring the session data is consistent
    and meets game requirements.
  description: The ValidateFarmingSession method checks whether a given farming session
    is valid for the specified player. It verifies that all session data adheres to
    game rules, such as proper resource allocation, time constraints, and player permissions.
    This method ensures that no invalid or maliciously crafted farming sessions can
    be processed by the game system. The validation includes checking session integrity,
    resource availability, and player state consistency. If any validation fails,
    the method returns false, indicating that the session should not be accepted for
    processing.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This value is used to verify the session belongs to the correct player
      and that the player is in a valid state for farming.
  - name: session
    description: A constant reference to a FarmingSession object containing all relevant
      data about the farming activity, including resources, duration, and other session
      metadata. This data is validated against game rules and player state.
  returns: Returns true if the farming session is valid and meets all game requirements;
    otherwise, returns false if validation fails due to invalid data or inconsistent
    state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Validation
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nFarmingSession session;\n// Populate session with\
      \ farming data\nbool isValid = coordinator.ValidateFarmingSession(&playerId,\
      \ session);\nif (isValid) {\n    // Proceed with farming logic\n} else {\n \
      \   // Reject the session\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validation with Error Handling
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nFarmingSession session;\n// Assume session is populated\
      \ from client input\nif (!coordinator.ValidateFarmingSession(&playerId, session))\
      \ {\n    // Log invalid session attempt\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid farming\
      \ session for player %d\", playerId);\n    // Send error message to client\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before processing any farming activity to
    prevent exploitation or data corruption. It may perform checks on session timestamps,
    resource counts, and player permissions. The method assumes that the player pointer
    points to a valid player object in the game world.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null player pointer as it will likely cause
    a crash or undefined behavior. Ensure that the FarmingSession data is properly
    initialized before passing it to this method.
