  class: MistweaverReNewingMistTracker
  method: RemoveTarget
  signature: void MistweaverReNewingMistTracker::RemoveTarget(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a target from the Mistweaver Renewing Mist tracker by its GUID.
  description: The RemoveTarget method removes a specific target from the Mistweaver
    Renewing Mist tracker using its unique identifier (GUID). This method is typically
    used when a target dies, becomes invalid, or is no longer affected by the Renewing
    Mist ability. The method ensures that the internal tracking data for the specified
    target is cleared and any associated effects are properly cleaned up. It's an
    essential part of maintaining accurate tracking of active targets under the effects
    of Renewing Mist in the Mistweaver class gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target to be removed from the
      tracker. This should correspond to a valid GameObject or Unit in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a target from Renewing Mist tracker
    code: 'MistweaverReNewingMistTracker tracker;

      Unit* target = ...; // Some unit that was affected by Renewing Mist

      tracker.RemoveTarget(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the GUID parameter is valid and corresponds to an existing
    tracked target. It's important to ensure that the target has been properly added
    to the tracker before attempting removal. The implementation likely involves removing
    entries from internal data structures such as maps or lists.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or errors. Always verify that a target exists in the tracker
    before calling RemoveTarget to avoid potential issues.
