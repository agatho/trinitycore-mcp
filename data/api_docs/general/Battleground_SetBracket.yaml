  brief: Sets the PVP bracket for the battleground using the provided PVPDifficultyEntry.
  description: The SetBracket method assigns a specific PvP difficulty bracket to

    for players participating in the battleground. The method is typically invoked
    during battleground initialization or when adjusting the battleground's configuration.
    It updates internal state to reflect the new bracket settings, ensuring that player
    matchmaking and reward calculations align with the specified bracket parameters.
  parameters:

    description: Pointer to a PVPDifficultyEntry structure defining the PvP bracket
      settings including min/max levels, rating ranges, and reward multipliers. Must
      not be null.

      \ bg->SetBracket(bracket);\n}"
