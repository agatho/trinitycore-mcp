documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new InsanityTracker instance with default values.
  description: The InsanityTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the InsanityTracker
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the tracker, typically initializing
    counters, flags, or data structures used to monitor insanity-related mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. The constructor is called automatically when a new InsanityTracker
    object is created, and it ensures that all member variables are properly initialized
    before any other operations are performed on the object. This initialization is
    crucial for maintaining consistent behavior throughout the game's insanity tracking
    system.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InsanityTracker instance
    code: 'InsanityTracker tracker;

      // The constructor is automatically called here, initializing all internal state'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor should not be called manually in most cases as it's designed
    to be invoked automatically during object creation. Developers should ensure that
    any initialization logic within the constructor doesn't rely on external dependencies
    that may not yet be available.
