documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AuctionHouse instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The AuctionHouse destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated during the lifetime of an AuctionHouse object. This includes
    releasing any internal data structures, canceling active auctions, and ensuring
    no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur. In the context of TrinityCore's auction
    house system, this method ensures that when an auction house instance is destroyed
    (such as during server shutdown or when a dynamic auction house is removed), all
    ongoing auction transactions are properly handled and no resources are left allocated.
    The destructor typically performs cleanup tasks in reverse order of initialization
    to maintain data integrity.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of AuctionHouse instance
    code: "void CleanupAuctionHouse()\n{\n    AuctionHouse* ah = new AuctionHouse();\n\
      \    // ... perform operations with auction house ...\n    delete ah; // Triggers\
      \ ~AuctionHouse() destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an AuctionHouse object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this method
    should not be called directly unless you're managing the object lifecycle manually.
    The destruction process may involve database operations to update auction statuses
    and clean up persistent data.
  warnings: Calling the destructor manually on a stack-allocated AuctionHouse object
    will result in undefined behavior if the object is not properly constructed or
    if it's already been destroyed. Additionally, ensure that no other threads are
    accessing the auction house during destruction to prevent race conditions.
