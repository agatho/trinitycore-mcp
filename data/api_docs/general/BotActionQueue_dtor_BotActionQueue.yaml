documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotActionQueue instance and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotActionQueue class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and resources used by the queue.
    This includes releasing any action objects that may be stored within the queue,
    ensuring no memory leaks occur when the queue is destroyed. The destructor is
    automatically invoked when a BotActionQueue object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method ensures that bot
    action queues are properly disposed of without leaving dangling pointers or consuming
    unnecessary memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Destruction of BotActionQueue
    code: 'BotActionQueue* queue = new BotActionQueue();

      // ... perform operations with the queue ...

      delete queue; // Triggers ~BotActionQueue() destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be called only on objects that were allocated on the
    heap using 'new'. If the object was created on the stack, the destructor is automatically
    invoked when it goes out of scope. This destructor likely handles cleanup of internal
    data structures such as linked lists or vectors containing bot actions.
