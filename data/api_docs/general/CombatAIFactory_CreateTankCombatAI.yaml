  class: CombatAIFactory
  method: CreateTankCombatAI
  signature: int CombatAIFactory::CreateTankCombatAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a tank combat AI for a bot, returning a status code
    indicating success or failure.
  description: The CreateTankCombatAI method is responsible for instantiating a specialized
    combat AI behavior tailored for tank roles within the TrinityCore framework. This
    function allocates memory for a new tank AI instance and configures it with appropriate
    settings such as threat management, aggro handling, and defensive abilities. The
    method ensures that the created AI adheres to the game's combat mechanics and
    role-specific behaviors expected of a tank class. It is typically invoked when
    a bot needs to be assigned a tank combat style, either during initialization or
    when switching roles dynamically.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot identifier. This parameter
      is used to store the created AI instance's reference number upon successful
      creation.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the operation.
    A return value of 0 typically signifies success, while non-zero values may indicate
    various error conditions such as invalid input parameters, insufficient memory
    allocation, or internal system failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int botId = 0;\nint result = factory.CreateTankCombatAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Successfully created tank AI for bot\n    std::cout << \"\
      Tank AI created for bot ID: \" << botId << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ error\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to create tank AI, error code: \" << result\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the underlying CombatAI system has been properly
    initialized and that sufficient resources are available for creating new AI instances.
    The returned bot identifier should be used in subsequent calls to manage or interact
    with the created AI instance.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the CombatAIFactory
    may result in undefined behavior. Additionally, repeated calls without cleaning
    up previous AI instances might lead to memory leaks or resource exhaustion.
