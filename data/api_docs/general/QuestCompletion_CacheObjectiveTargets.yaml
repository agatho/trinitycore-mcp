  method: CacheObjectiveTargets
  signature: void QuestCompletion::CacheObjectiveTargets(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Caches objective targets for a player's quest completion handling.
  description: The CacheObjectiveTargets method prepares and stores target information
    related to quest objectives for a specified player. This caching mechanism is
    typically used during quest completion processing to ensure that all necessary
    target data is readily available without repeated database lookups or complex
    calculations. The method likely populates internal structures with relevant NPC,
    GameObject, or item identifiers that are required to fulfill quest requirements.
    It serves as a preparatory step before quest validation or reward distribution
    occurs.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which quest objective targets need
      to be cached. This parameter must not be null and should represent an active
      player character in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      QuestCompletion questComp;

      questComp.CacheObjectiveTargets(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger quest completion system and may be
    called internally during quest state transitions. The caching behavior suggests
    performance optimization for frequently accessed quest data. Implementation details
    may involve database queries or world object lookups to gather target information.
