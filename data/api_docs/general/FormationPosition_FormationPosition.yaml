  class: FormationPosition
  method: FormationPosition
  signature: void FormationPosition::FormationPosition(float x, float y, float angle,
    uint8 slotId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a formation position with specified coordinates, angle, and slot
    ID for creature positioning.
  description: The FormationPosition constructor initializes a formation position
    object with the given x and y coordinates, angle, and slot ID. This method is
    used to define the positional data for creatures in a group formation, where each
    member occupies a specific slot relative to the formation center. The angle parameter
    determines the orientation of the creature within the formation, while the slot
    ID identifies the creature's position in the group. This functionality is essential
    for implementing group behaviors such as escorting, following, or coordinated
    movement patterns in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore engine.
  parameters:
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the formation position relative to the formation
      center
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the formation position relative to the formation
      center
  - name: angle
    description: The angular orientation (in radians) of the creature within the formation
  - name: slotId
    description: The slot identifier that defines the creature's position in the formation
      group (0-255)
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize a formation position for a group member
    code: FormationPosition pos(10.5f, -3.2f, 1.57f, 2);
    language: cpp
  - title: Create formation positions for multiple creatures in a patrol
    code: 'std::vector<FormationPosition> positions;

      positions.emplace_back(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0); // Leader

      positions.emplace_back(5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1);   // Right side

      positions.emplace_back(-5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 2);  // Left side'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the AI system when setting up
    formation data for creature groups. The slot ID should be unique within a formation
    group to avoid conflicts. The angle parameter uses radians and represents the
    direction the creature should face relative to the formation center.
  warnings: Ensure that the slotId values are within valid range (0-255) to prevent
    undefined behavior. Incorrect coordinate values may cause creatures to spawn in
    unexpected locations or fail to maintain formation.
