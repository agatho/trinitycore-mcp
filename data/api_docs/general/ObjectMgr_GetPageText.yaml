documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the page text data for a specified page entry ID from the object
    manager's internal storage.
  description: The GetPageText method fetches a PageText object associated with a
    given page entry identifier from the ObjectMgr's data structures. This method
    is typically used when handling quest items or books that contain textual content
    which should be displayed to players. The returned pointer points to an immutable
    PageText structure containing the text content and related metadata for the specified
    page. If no page text exists for the provided ID, the method returns a null pointer.
    The internal storage of page texts is usually populated during server startup
    from database entries or DBC files.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a PageText object if a valid page entry exists; otherwise,
    returns nullptr indicating no data was found for the specified page ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display page text
    code: "const PageText* page = sObjectMgr->GetPageText(12345);\nif (page)\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Page Text: %s\\n\", page->Text.c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"\
      No page text found for ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures of ObjectMgr which are typically
    thread-safe in TrinityCore's implementation. However, since it's a getter function,
    it should not modify any state and can be safely called from multiple threads
    concurrently.
