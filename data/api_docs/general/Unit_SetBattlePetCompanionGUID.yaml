  class: Unit
  method: SetBattlePetCompanionGUID
  signature: void Unit::SetBattlePetCompanionGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of the battle pet companion for the unit.
  description: This method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to the battle pet companion
    associated with the Unit object. The GUID represents the specific battle pet that
    is currently being controlled or managed by the unit, typically in the context
    of World of Warcraft's battle pet system. This method is commonly used when setting
    up battle pet companions for players or NPCs, and it ensures that the proper battle
    pet is linked to the unit's entity. The method does not validate the GUID itself,
    but rather sets it directly as a property of the unit.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet companion to be set
      for the unit. This value is typically obtained from the battle pet system or
      related database entries.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Battle Pet Companion GUID
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetBattlePetCompanionGUID(12345);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the broader battle pet system implementation in TrinityCore.
    It should be used carefully as it directly affects the unit's battle pet companion
    state. The GUID value must be valid and consistent with the battle pet system's
    expectations.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect battle pet states or
    inconsistencies in the game world, especially if the GUID is not properly validated
    or matches an existing battle pet entry.
