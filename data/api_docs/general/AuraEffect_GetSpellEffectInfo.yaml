  class: AuraEffect
  method: GetSpellEffectInfo
  signature: const int & AuraEffect::GetSpellEffectInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell effect information associated with this aura effect.
  description: The GetSpellEffectInfo method returns a constant reference to an integer
    that represents the spell effect information for the current aura effect. This
    value typically corresponds to the SpellEffect entry in the database and is used
    to determine how the aura effect should behave, what kind of modification it applies,
    and which mechanics are triggered. The returned value is read-only and should
    not be modified directly. This method is commonly used in aura handling logic
    to differentiate between various spell effects within the same spell, such as
    damage over time effects, healing effects, or stat modifications.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer representing the spell effect information.
    This value usually corresponds to a SpellEffect ID from the game's database and
    defines the specific behavior of the aura effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Effect Type
    code: "AuraEffect const* auraEffect = unit->GetAuraEffect(SPELL_ID, EFFECT_INDEX);\n\
      if (auraEffect)\n{\n    int effectInfo = auraEffect->GetSpellEffectInfo();\n\
      \    if (effectInfo == SPELL_EFFECT_SCHOOL_DAMAGE)\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ damage over time effect\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned integer value is typically derived from the SpellEffect.dbc
    file in the game's data files. This method does not perform any computation or
    lookup itself, but rather returns a cached or pre-computed value that was set
    during aura initialization. The value should remain constant throughout the lifetime
    of the aura effect.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference as it is const. Modifying it could
    lead to undefined behavior or corruption of the aura's internal state. This method
    should only be called on valid aura effects; calling it on a null aura effect
    will result in undefined behavior.
