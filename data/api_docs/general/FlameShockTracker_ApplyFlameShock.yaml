  class: FlameShockTracker
  method: ApplyFlameShock
  signature: void FlameShockTracker::ApplyFlameShock(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a Flame Shock effect to the specified unit with the given duration.
  description: The ApplyFlameShock method is used to apply the Flame Shock spell effect
    to a target unit identified by its GUID. This method sets up the necessary tracking
    and application logic for the Flame Shock debuff, which typically deals fire damage
    over time. The duration parameter controls how long the effect will remain active
    on the target. This method is commonly used in Shaman class spell handling within
    TrinityCore's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply Flame Shock
      to. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Flame Shock effect will
      remain active on the target. Must be a positive integer value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flame Shock Application
    code: 'FlameShockTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyFlameShock(12345, 6000);

      // Applies Flame Shock to unit with GUID 12345 for 6 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Duration Application
    code: 'uint32 spellDuration = 4000 + (player->GetLevel() * 500);

      tracker.ApplyFlameShock(targetGuid, spellDuration);

      // Applies Flame Shock with duration based on player level'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the World of Warcraft's aura system to
    properly track and apply the Flame Shock debuff. The implementation may involve
    creating or updating an existing aura on the target unit. Ensure that the GUID
    provided corresponds to a valid unit in the current world context.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate the target before applying effects.
    The duration parameter should be carefully managed to prevent excessive or negative
    values that could cause game instability.
