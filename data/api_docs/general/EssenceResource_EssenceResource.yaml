  brief: Initializes a new EssenceResource instance with default values
  description: The EssenceResource constructor initializes a new instance of the EssenceResource
    class. This method sets up the internal state of the resource with default values,
    typically initializing member variables to their zero or null states. In the context
    of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, this would commonly be used to create
    new essence-based resources such as those used in class-specific abilities, artifact
    powers, or other game mechanics that require tracking of essence quantities. The
    constructor ensures proper initialization before the object can be used in gameplay
    logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Construction
    code: 'EssenceResource resource;

      // Creates a new EssenceResource with default initialization'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Player Class
    code: "class Player\n{\nprivate:\n    EssenceResource m_essenceResource;\npublic:\n\
      \    void InitializePlayer()\n    {\n        // Constructor automatically called\
      \ during object creation\n        m_essenceResource.EssenceResource(); // Explicit\
      \ call (though typically not needed)\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method, so it should be called implicitly when creating
    an instance of the class. The explicit signature 'void EssenceResource::EssenceResource()'
    suggests this might be a default constructor that performs initialization tasks.
    In TrinityCore, resource management constructors often initialize internal tracking
    variables and set up data structures for efficient access during gameplay.
  warnings: Since this is a constructor, it should not be called explicitly after
    object creation as it would reinitialize the object's state. Be cautious when
    using this in scenarios where object reuse is expected rather than destruction
    and recreation.
