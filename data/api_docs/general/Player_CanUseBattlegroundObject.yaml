documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can interact with a battleground object
  description: This method checks if a player is allowed to use a specific battleground
    object, such as a flag or capture point, based on their current game state and
    the battleground's rules. It evaluates whether the player meets the conditions
    required to interact with the object, including being in the correct phase, having
    the proper team, and not being in a state that would prevent interaction. The
    method is typically used during battlegrounds to validate player actions and ensure
    game balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player can use the battleground object, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the player's current state allows interaction with the
    specified object based on battleground rules.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->CanUseBattlegroundObject(&gameobject)) {\n    // Player can\
      \ interact with the object\n    // Proceed with object interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battleground scripts and game logic to validate
    player interactions with objects. It may involve checking player state, phase,
    and team membership. Performance considerations include avoiding unnecessary checks
    during battlegrounds where multiple players interact with the same object.
  warnings: This method should not be called outside of battleground contexts as it
    may return incorrect results if player is not in a battleground. The method assumes
    that gameobject parameter is properly initialized and valid.
