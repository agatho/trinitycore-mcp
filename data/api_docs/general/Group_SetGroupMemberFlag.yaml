  signature: void Group::SetGroupMemberFlag(int guid, bool apply, GroupMemberFlags
    flag)
documentation:
  brief: Sets or removes a specified flag for a group member identified by GUID.
  description: The SetGroupMemberFlag method modifies the group membership flags for
    a specific player within the group. It allows setting or clearing individual flags
    such as leader, assistant, or main assist status. This functionality is used internally
    by the game to manage group roles and permissions. The method operates on the
    group member identified by the provided GUID and applies the specified flag based
    on the 'apply' parameter. Changes made through this method are typically synchronized
    with the client to reflect updated group member roles.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group member whose flag is being
      modified. This should be a valid player GUID within the current group context.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean value indicating whether to set (true) or clear (false) the
      specified flag for the group member.
  - name: flag
    description: The GroupMemberFlags enum value representing the specific flag to
      be set or cleared. Valid flags include LEADER, ASSISTANT, MAIN_ASSIST, etc.,
      depending on the game's implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a player as main assist
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetGroupMemberFlag(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ true, GroupMemberFlags::MAIN_ASSIST);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove leader flag from a group member
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetGroupMemberFlag(targetGuid,\
      \ false, GroupMemberFlags::LEADER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when group
    roles change. It's important to ensure that the GUID corresponds to a valid member
    of the current group, otherwise behavior may be undefined. The method does not
    perform any validation on the flag value itself, so invalid flags might result
    in unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID or flag value can lead to undefined
    behavior or client desynchronization. Always verify that the player is actually
    a member of the group before calling this method. Avoid calling this method from
    multiple threads simultaneously without proper synchronization.
