  class: ResearchHistory
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ResearchHistory::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes research history creation data to a byte buffer for transmission to
    clients.
  description: 'The WriteCreate method serializes the research history data of a player
    into a ByteBuffer, which is then used to send the research history information
    to the client. This method is typically invoked when a player''s research progress
    needs to be initialized or synchronized with the client. It takes two player references:
    one for the owner of the research history and another for the receiver who will
    view this data. The serialized data includes all relevant research-related fields
    that define the current state of the research history.'
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized research history data
      will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the research
      history being written.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the client receiving this
      research history data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get player instance

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player instance

      ResearchHistory history;

      history.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      WorldPacket packet(SMSG_RESEARCH_HISTORY, data.size());

      packet.append(data);

      receiver->SendDirectMessage(&packet);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's internal packet serialization system
    for research history data. It assumes that both owner and receiver pointers are
    valid and properly initialized. The method does not perform any validation on
    these parameters beyond ensuring they are non-null.
