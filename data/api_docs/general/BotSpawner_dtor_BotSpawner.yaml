documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BotSpawner instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotSpawner class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated data structures, terminating spawned bots,
    and ensuring proper cleanup of internal state. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI and bot system, this method ensures that when a BotSpawner is no longer needed,
    it properly disposes of all associated bot instances and prevents memory leaks
    or dangling references.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotSpawner
    code: "void ExampleFunction() {\n    BotSpawner* spawner = new BotSpawner();\n\
      \    // ... use the spawner ...\n    delete spawner; // Triggers ~BotSpawner()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that all bot instances created
    by this spawner are properly terminated before the destructor runs to avoid potential
    issues with active AI threads or memory corruption.
