  class: ComplaintTicket
  method: SetNote
  signature: void ComplaintTicket::SetNote(const int & note)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the note field of a complaint ticket to the provided value.
  description: The SetNote method assigns a new note value to a complaint ticket instance.
    This method is typically used to update or modify the descriptive text associated
    with a player's complaint. The note may contain details about the issue being
    reported, such as character names, locations, or specific game events. The method
    does not perform any validation on the input note value and directly assigns it
    to the internal note field of the ticket object. This operation is generally part
    of the ticket management system within TrinityCore's complaint handling framework.
  parameters:
  - name: note
    description: The new note value to assign to the complaint ticket. This should
      be an integer representing the note content or identifier, typically referencing
      a specific complaint note entry in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Complaint Note
    code: 'ComplaintTicket* ticket = new ComplaintTicket();

      ticket->SetNote(12345);

      // The note field of the ticket is now set to 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the ComplaintTicket object.
    It should only be called when the ticket is in a valid state for modification.
    The note parameter is expected to correspond to a valid entry in the complaint_note
    database table.
  warnings: Ensure that the note value passed to this method corresponds to an existing
    note entry in the database to avoid orphaned references or data inconsistencies.
    This method does not validate whether the note exists, so calling code must ensure
    validity.
