  method: GetFishingBaseSkillLevel
  signature: int32 ObjectMgr::GetFishingBaseSkillLevel(const int * areaEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the base fishing skill level required for a specific area.
  description: The GetFishingBaseSkillLevel method returns the minimum fishing skill
    level that players must have to successfully fish in a given area. This value
    is typically used by the game's fishing system to determine whether a player can
    catch fish in a particular zone or location. The method takes an area entry identifier
    as input and looks up the corresponding base skill requirement from internal game
    data structures. It is commonly called during fishing attempts to validate if
    the player's current fishing skill meets or exceeds the minimum threshold for
    the targeted area.
  parameters:
  - name: areaEntry
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the area identifier (AreaTableEntry
      ID) for which the base fishing skill level is requested. This value corresponds
      to a specific zone or region in the game world where fishing is possible.
  returns: Returns an int32 value indicating the minimum base fishing skill level
    required to fish effectively in the specified area. A negative value typically
    indicates that no valid data exists for the given area entry, or the area does
    not support fishing activities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 baseSkill = sObjectMgr->GetFishingBaseSkillLevel(&areaId);\nif (baseSkill\
      \ >= 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with fishing logic\n    printf(\"Minimum fishing\
      \ skill required: %d\\n\", baseSkill);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid area\
      \ or unsupported fishing\n    printf(\"Fishing not supported in this area.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Fishing Check
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object\nuint32 playerAreaId\
      \ = player->GetAreaId(); // Get current area ID\nint32 requiredSkill = sObjectMgr->GetFishingBaseSkillLevel(&playerAreaId);\n\
      if (requiredSkill >= 0 && player->GetSkillValue(SKILL_FISHING) >= requiredSkill)\n\
      {\n    // Player can fish in this area\n    player->SendDirectMessage(\"You\
      \ can fish here.\");\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player cannot fish due to skill or\
      \ area limitations\n    player->SendDirectMessage(\"You cannot fish in this\
      \ location.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal data structures that map area identifiers
    to fishing skill requirements. The implementation may cache results for performance
    reasons, especially since fishing skill checks are frequent during gameplay. Developers
    should ensure the area ID passed is valid and corresponds to an actual zone in
    the game world.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or an invalid area ID could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect return values. Always validate that the input areaEntry points to
    a valid area entry before calling this method. Additionally, some areas may not
    have fishing data defined, resulting in negative return values which should be
    handled appropriately.
