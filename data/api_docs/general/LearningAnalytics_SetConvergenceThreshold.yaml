  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: SetConvergenceThreshold
  signature: void LearningAnalytics::SetConvergenceThreshold(float threshold)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the convergence threshold value for learning analytics processing.
  description: The SetConvergenceThreshold method configures the threshold value used
    by the LearningAnalytics class to determine when a learning process has converged.
    This threshold is typically used in machine learning or adaptive difficulty systems
    within TrinityCore to define when a model's performance stabilizes. The method
    accepts a floating-point value representing the convergence criteria, which may
    be interpreted as a delta change in accuracy, loss function, or other metric.
    Setting this value affects how the system evaluates completion of learning cycles
    and can influence game balance or AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: threshold
    description: A floating-point value that defines the convergence threshold. This
      represents the minimum acceptable change in learning metrics to continue processing,
      or the maximum allowable deviation before considering convergence achieved.
      Valid values are typically positive floats, with common ranges between 0.001
      and 0.1 depending on system requirements.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.SetConvergenceThreshold(0.01f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting High Precision Threshold
    code: 'LearningAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.SetConvergenceThreshold(0.001f); // For high precision learning'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in adaptive difficulty systems or AI behavior
    tuning within TrinityCore. The threshold value directly impacts how quickly learning
    processes are considered complete, which may affect game progression or challenge
    scaling.
  warnings: Setting the convergence threshold too low may cause infinite loops or
    excessive processing time if the system never achieves sufficient convergence.
    Conversely, setting it too high may result in premature termination of learning
    processes with suboptimal outcomes.
