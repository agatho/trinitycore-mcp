  class: BotAIActivation
  method: ReconfigureBot
  signature: bool BotAIActivation::ReconfigureBot(int * bot, const BotAIConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Reconfigures a bot's AI settings using the provided configuration.
  description: The ReconfigureBot method updates the AI behavior and settings of a
    specified bot character. It takes a pointer to the bot's identifier and a configuration
    object containing new AI parameters. This method allows dynamic adjustment of
    bot behavior during runtime, which is useful for testing different AI strategies
    or adapting bots to changing game conditions. The method performs validation on
    the input parameters and returns true if the reconfiguration was successful, false
    otherwise. This functionality is typically used in bot management systems within
    TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the bot
      to be reconfigured. Must point to a valid bot GUID or nullptr for error handling.
  - name: config
    description: Reference to a BotAIConfig object containing the new AI settings
      and parameters to apply to the specified bot. This includes behavior flags,
      decision-making parameters, and other configurable AI properties.
  returns: True if the bot was successfully reconfigured with the new settings; false
    if the operation failed due to invalid input, null pointer, or other error conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Reconfiguration
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nBotAIConfig newConfig;\nnewConfig.aggression = 0.8f;\n\
      newConfig.defense = 0.6f;\nbool success = botAIActivation->ReconfigureBot(&botId,\
      \ newConfig);\nif (success) {\n    // Bot reconfigured successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling in Bot Reconfiguration
    code: "int* botPtr = nullptr;\nBotAIConfig config;\n// Attempt to reconfigure\
      \ with invalid pointer\nbool result = botAIActivation->ReconfigureBot(botPtr,\
      \ config);\nif (!result) {\n    // Handle error - bot pointer was null\n   \
      \ printf(\"Failed to reconfigure bot: invalid pointer\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot is already initialized and active within
    the AI system. The configuration object should be validated before calling this
    method to ensure all parameters are within acceptable ranges. Performance impact
    is minimal as it only updates internal configuration data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method on a non-existent or inactive bot may result in undefined
    behavior. Always validate that the bot pointer refers to an active bot before
    invoking this method. Modifying AI configurations during active combat scenarios
    might cause unexpected behavior.
