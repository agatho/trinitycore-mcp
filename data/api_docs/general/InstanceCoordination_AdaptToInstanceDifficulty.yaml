  class: InstanceCoordination

  signature: void InstanceCoordination::AdaptToInstanceDifficulty(Group * group, float
    difficultyRating)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts group instance difficulty settings based on provided difficulty rating.
  description: The AdaptToInstanceDifficulty method modifies the instance coordination
    settings for a given group according to a specified difficulty rating. This method
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to
    dynamically adjust instance parameters such as enemy scaling, loot distribution,
    and encounter difficulty based on the group's collective performance or chosen
    difficulty level. The method ensures that all players within the group experience
    appropriate challenge levels and rewards consistent with their selected difficulty
    setting. It may also update internal tracking mechanisms to maintain synchronization
    across the group's instance data.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object whose instance coordination settings
      will be adjusted. Must not be null.
  - name: difficultyRating
    description: Floating-point value representing the desired difficulty level for
      the instance. Typically ranges from 1.0 (normal) to higher values for more challenging
      difficulties, though exact scale depends on server configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with normal difficulty
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->AdaptToInstanceDifficulty(myGroup,\
      \ 1.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with heroic difficulty rating
    code: "Group* raidGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (raidGroup && raidGroup->isRaidGroup())\n\
      {\n    instanceCoordination->AdaptToInstanceDifficulty(raidGroup, 2.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal instance difficulty tracking systems
    and may trigger updates to player data synchronization across the server. It should
    only be called when the group is in an appropriate state for difficulty adjustment,
    such as before entering an instance or during a transition phase.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters (e.g., null group pointer
    or negative difficulty rating) could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure
    that the group is valid and that the difficultyRating value conforms to expected
    server ranges.
