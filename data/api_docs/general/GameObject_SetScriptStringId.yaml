  class: GameObject
  method: SetScriptStringId
  signature: void GameObject::SetScriptStringId(std::string id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the script string identifier for a game object, allowing for custom
    scripting and identification within the TrinityCore framework.
  description: This method assigns a unique string identifier to a GameObject instance,
    which can be used for custom script handling and identification purposes within
    the TrinityCore core. The script string ID is typically used to reference specific
    behaviors or configurations in custom scripts, enabling developers to create specialized
    game object behaviors without modifying core code. This method is commonly used
    when implementing custom AI or scripting logic for game objects, particularly
    in scenarios where object-specific behavior needs to be defined through string-based
    identifiers rather than numerical IDs.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The string identifier to assign to the GameObject. This value must
      be a valid string that uniquely identifies the object within the script context,
      typically used for referencing custom behaviors or configurations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Script String ID
    code: 'GameObject* go = new GameObject();

      go->SetScriptStringId("CustomScriptID");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Script String ID in Custom AI
    code: "void GameObject::SetScriptStringId(std::string id) {\n    // Implementation\
      \ for custom script handling\n}\n// Usage example\nGameObject* go = new GameObject();\n\
      go->SetScriptStringId(\"MyCustomScript\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with other GameObject methods
    that handle script identification or when implementing custom AI logic. It should
    be noted that this method does not directly affect the object's physical properties,
    but rather its scripting behavior and identification within the core framework.
  warnings: Care must be taken when assigning string IDs to avoid conflicts with existing
    script identifiers in the system. This method should not be used for objects that
    already have an assigned ID unless it is intended to override or replace the previous
    identifier.
