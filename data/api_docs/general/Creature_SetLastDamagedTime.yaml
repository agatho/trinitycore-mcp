documentation:
  brief: Sets the last damaged time for a creature to track when it was last hit by
    damage.
  description: This method updates the internal timestamp of a creature that records
    the last time it was damaged by any form of damage. The value is stored as a time_t
    type, representing seconds since epoch, and can be used for various game mechanics
    including tracking cooldowns, determining when a creature was last attacked, or
    managing AI behavior based on recent damage events. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other creature damage-related methods to maintain accurate
    state information about the creature's condition.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetLastDamagedTime(time(NULL);

      // The creature''s last damaged time is now set to current time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the creature's internal state and should be
    used carefully when modifying creature behavior or AI logic. It may impact how
    certain game mechanics are handled, particularly those involving cooldowns or
    damage-based triggers.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in scenarios where multiple damage
    events occur rapidly, as it could interfere with proper cooldown tracking if not
    managed correctly. Also note that setting this value does not necessarily mean
    the creature has been damaged; it simply records the timestamp of the last damage
    event.
