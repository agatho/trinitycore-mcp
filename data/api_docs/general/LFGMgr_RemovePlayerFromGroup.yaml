  signature: uint8 LFGMgr::RemovePlayerFromGroup(int gguid, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from a LFG group by GUID
  description: 'The RemovePlayerFromGroup method removes a specified player from a
    Looking For Group (LFG) group using their unique identifiers. This function is
    typically used when a player leaves a group, gets kicked, or when the group is
    disbanded. The method takes two parameters: the group GUID (gguid) and the player
    GUID (guid). It returns a status code indicating success or failure of the operation.
    The LFG system in TrinityCore manages dungeon and raid groups for players seeking
    content through the game''s built-in grouping system.'
  parameters:
  - name: gguid
    description: The global unique identifier of the LFG group from which the player
      will be removed
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the player to be removed from the
      LFG group
  returns: Returns uint8 value indicating the result of the operation. Common return
    values include 0 for success, and non-zero values for various error conditions
    such as invalid group or player GUIDs, player not found in group, or group already
    disbanded.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to remove a player from an LFG group
    code: "uint8 result = sLFGMgr->RemovePlayerFromGroup(12345, 67890);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Player successfully removed\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LFG_REMOVED_FROM_GROUP);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle error based on result value\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LFG_REMOVE_FAILED);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using RemovePlayerFromGroup in a group management context
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeaveLFGGroup(Player* player, uint64 groupId) {\n    if\
      \ (!player || !groupId) return;\n    \n    uint8 result = sLFGMgr->RemovePlayerFromGroup(groupId,\
      \ player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n    \n    if (result == 0) {\n        //\
      \ Notify other group members\n        player->GetSession()->SendLfgPlayerLeave();\n\
      \        sWorld->SendWorldText(LFG_PLAYER_LEFT_GROUP, player->GetName().c_str());\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Log error or notify player\n        sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to remove player %u from LFG group %u\", player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ groupId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG (Looking For Group) subsystem in TrinityCore.
    It's typically called internally by the LFG system when managing group membership,
    but can also be invoked directly from other systems that need to manipulate LFG
    groups. The function assumes valid GUIDs and proper group state management.
  warnings: Ensure that both gguid and guid parameters are valid before calling this
    method. Improper use may lead to inconsistent group states or crashes if invalid
    GUIDs are passed. This method should not be called on groups that have already
    been disbanded or are in an invalid state.
