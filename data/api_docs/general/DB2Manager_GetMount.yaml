  signature: const MountEntry * DB2Manager::GetMount(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the mount entry associated with a given spell ID from the DB2 database.
  description: The GetMount method retrieves a const pointer to a MountEntry object
    that corresponds to the provided spell ID. This method is typically used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to access mount data stored in
    the DB2 files, which contain static game data such as mount information. The method
    performs a lookup in an internal cache or database structure and returns a pointer
    to the entry if found, or nullptr if no matching mount exists for the given spell
    ID. It is commonly used during player login, mount acquisition checks, or when
    validating whether a specific spell corresponds to a valid mount.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a MountEntry object representing the mount associated
    with the specified spell ID. Returns nullptr if no mount entry exists for the
    given spell ID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Validate Mount Entry
    code: "const MountEntry* mount = sDB2Manager->GetMount(46753);\nif (mount)\n{\n\
      \    // Mount found, proceed with logic\n    printf(\"Found mount: %s\\n\",\
      \ mount->Name);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No mount associated with spell ID\n    printf(\"\
      No mount found for spell ID 46753\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it operates on cached data structures within
    DB2Manager. It assumes that the DB2 files have been properly loaded and parsed
    before this method is called. The returned pointer is valid only for the lifetime
    of the DB2Manager instance.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned MountEntry object directly, as it's const.
    Accessing a spell ID that does not correspond to any mount will result in a nullptr
    return value, which must be checked before dereferencing.
