  class: AuctionPosting
  method: CalculateMinIncrement
  signature: uint64 AuctionPosting::CalculateMinIncrement() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the minimum bid increment required for an auction
    item.
  description: The CalculateMinIncrement method determines the smallest possible increase
    in bid amount that can be placed on an auction item. This value is calculated
    based on the current bid amount and follows World of Warcraft's auction house
    rules, where bid increments typically scale with the item's value. The method
    ensures that players cannot make arbitrarily small bids, maintaining fair auction
    dynamics. It is used internally by the auction system to validate new bids and
    enforce minimum increment requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the minimum bid increment in copper.
    This value is calculated based on the current highest bid and follows WoW's auction
    house increment rules, typically increasing as the bid amount increases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuctionPosting posting;

      uint64 minIncrement = posting.CalculateMinIncrement();

      // Returns minimum bid increment for the current auction item'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when validating a new bid against an existing
    auction. The calculation logic follows Blizzard's standard auction house rules
    where bid increments increase as the current bid amount increases, ensuring fair
    competition and preventing trivial bidding.
