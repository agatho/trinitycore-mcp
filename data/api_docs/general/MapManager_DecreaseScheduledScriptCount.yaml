  signature: void MapManager::DecreaseScheduledScriptCount(std::size_t count)
documentation:
  brief: Decrements the scheduled script count by the specified value.
  description: The DecreaseScheduledScriptCount method reduces the internal counter
    that tracks the number of scheduled scripts on a map. This counter is typically
    used to manage script execution and ensure proper cleanup when scripts are no
    longer needed. The method takes a std::size_t parameter representing how many
    scheduled scripts to decrement the count by. It's commonly used in conjunction
    with script scheduling mechanisms within the TrinityCore framework, particularly
    when cleaning up or finalizing script execution contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: count
    description: The number of scheduled scripts to decrement from the internal counter.
      Must be a non-negative value representing the count of scripts being removed
      from the scheduled queue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decrease script count by one
    code: MapManager::instance()->DecreaseScheduledScriptCount(1);
    language: cpp
  - title: Decrease script count for multiple scripts
    code: 'uint32_t numScripts = 5;

      MapManager::instance()->DecreaseScheduledScriptCount(numScripts);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core scripting system when
    scripts complete execution or are explicitly removed from the scheduled queue.
    It's important to ensure that the count being passed does not exceed the current
    scheduled script count, otherwise it may lead to undefined behavior or negative
    counts.
