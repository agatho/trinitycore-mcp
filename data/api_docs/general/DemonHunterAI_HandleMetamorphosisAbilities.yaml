  signature: void DemonHunterAI::HandleMetamorphosisAbilities(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the execution of metamorphosis abilities for a demon hunter AI.
  description: The HandleMetamorphosisAbilities method manages the logic and behavior
    associated with a demon hunter's metamorphosis ability. This includes determining
    when to activate the ability, selecting appropriate targets, and executing the
    necessary actions during the metamorphosis state. The method typically integrates
    with the AI's decision-making process to ensure optimal use of the powerful transformation
    ability in combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier for the
      metamorphosis ability. This parameter is used to determine which enemy to apply
      the metamorphosis effects against.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of HandleMetamorphosisAbilities
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        int target = GetTargetId();\n        HandleMetamorphosisAbilities(&target);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles when the demon hunter
    is in combat. It assumes that the AI has already determined it's appropriate to
    use metamorphosis and that the target is valid.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as passing a null or invalid target may result in undefined behavior
    during ability execution.
