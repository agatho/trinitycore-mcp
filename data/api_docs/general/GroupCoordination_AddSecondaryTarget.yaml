  class: GroupCoordination
  method: AddSecondaryTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordination::AddSecondaryTarget(int targetGuid, uint32 priority)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a secondary target to the group coordination system with specified priority.
  description: The AddSecondaryTarget method integrates a new target into the group
    coordination framework by associating it with a unique identifier and assigning
    it a priority level. This functionality is typically used in group-based AI systems
    where multiple targets need to be managed according to their importance or relevance
    within a shared context. The method does not return any value, indicating that
    it performs an action rather than computing a result. It assumes the existence
    of a valid group coordination instance and proper initialization of target data
    structures.
  parameters:
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target to be added as a secondary
      target. This value must be a valid integer representing an existing entity within
      the game world.
  - name: priority
    description: A numeric priority level assigned to the target, determining its
      order of importance in group coordination decisions. Higher values indicate
      higher priority.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'GroupCoordination* gc = new GroupCoordination();

      gc->AddSecondaryTarget(12345, 50);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Priority Management
    code: "GroupCoordination* gc = GetGroupCoordinationInstance();\nfor (int i = 0;\
      \ i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    uint32 priority = 100 - i;\n    gc->AddSecondaryTarget(1000\
      \ + i, priority);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger group AI system designed for cooperative
    gameplay scenarios such as raid encounters or dungeon groups. It may internally
    manage target lists and update coordination logic based on changes to these secondary
    targets.
