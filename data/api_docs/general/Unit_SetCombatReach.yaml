  class: Unit
  method: SetCombatReach
  signature: void Unit::SetCombatReach(float combatReach)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the combat reach distance for the unit, determining how close it can
    get to targets during combat.
  description: The SetCombatReach method adjusts the combat reach distance of a Unit
    object, which defines how close the unit can get to its target during combat.
    This parameter affects melee attacks and determines the minimum distance at which
    a unit can attack another unit. The value is typically measured in yards and influences
    the unit's ability to maintain proper combat distance with targets.
  parameters:
  - name: combatReach
    description: The combat reach distance in yards, representing the minimum distance
      at which the unit can attack its target during combat. Values must be positive
      and typically range from 0.5 to 10 yards depending on the unit type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->SetCombatReach(5.0f);

      // Sets combat reach to 5 yards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit;

      player->SetCombatReach(1.5f);

      // Sets combat reach to 1.5 yards for player character

      // This affects melee range and attack positioning'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the unit's combat behavior and should be used
    carefully as it influences attack range calculations. The value is typically set
    based on unit type (player, creature, etc.) and may vary depending on game mechanics.
  warnings: Improper use of combat reach values can lead to incorrect positioning
    during combat, potentially causing missed attacks or invalid combat situations.
    Ensure that the combat reach value matches the intended unit type.
