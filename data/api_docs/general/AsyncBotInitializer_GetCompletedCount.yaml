  class: AsyncBotInitializer
  method: GetCompletedCount
  signature: size_t AsyncBotInitializer::GetCompletedCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of completed asynchronous bot initialization tasks.
  description: The GetCompletedCount method retrieves the number of bot initialization
    operations that have finished execution within the AsyncBotInitializer class.
    This method is typically used to monitor progress during batch initialization
    of game bots, providing insight into how many bots have successfully completed
    their setup process. The returned count reflects the cumulative number of completed
    tasks since the initializer was created or reset, and it can be used for progress
    tracking, status reporting, or determining when all initializations are finished.
    This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A size_t value representing the total number of successfully completed
    bot initialization tasks. Returns zero if no tasks have been completed yet, or
    if the initializer has not started any operations.
  examples:
  - title: Monitor Bot Initialization Progress
    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      // ... start multiple bot initializations ...

      size_t completed = initializer.GetCompletedCount();

      printf("Completed %zu bot initializations\n", completed);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Wait for All Initializations to Complete
    code: "AsyncBotInitializer initializer;\n// ... start 100 bot initializations\
      \ ...\nwhile (initializer.GetCompletedCount() < 100) {\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\
      }\nprintf(\"All bots initialized successfully\\n\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a snapshot of completed tasks at the moment of invocation
    and does not block or wait for new completions. It is designed to be lightweight
    and efficient for frequent polling. The count may not reflect real-time updates
    if multiple threads are modifying the initializer state concurrently.
  warnings: The returned count only reflects successfully completed operations. If
    some initializations fail, those failures will not be included in this count,
    potentially leading to confusion when comparing against expected total task counts.
    Ensure proper error handling is implemented separately for failed tasks.
