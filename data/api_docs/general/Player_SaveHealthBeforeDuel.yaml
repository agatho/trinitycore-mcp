documentation:
  brief: Saves the player's current health value before entering a duel.
  description: The SaveHealthBeforeDuel method stores the player's current health
    state in a temporary variable prior to engaging in a duel. This ensures that the
    player's original health can be restored after the duel concludes, maintaining
    game balance and preventing health exploits. The method is typically invoked automatically
    by the duel system when a duel begins, and it preserves the health value at the
    moment of duel initiation for later restoration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic usage during duel start
    code: "void Player::HandleDuelStart()\n{\n    SaveHealthBeforeDuel();\n    //\
      \ Other duel initialization logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal duel management system and should not
    be called manually outside of duel context. The saved health value is typically
    accessed through a corresponding restore method after the duel ends.
