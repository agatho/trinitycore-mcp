  class: WheatyExceptionReport
  method: PrintSystemInfo
  signature: void WheatyExceptionReport::PrintSystemInfo()
documentation:
  brief: Prints detailed system information to the console or log for debugging exception
    reports.
  description: The PrintSystemInfo method gathers and outputs comprehensive system
    details such as operating system version, processor information, memory statistics,
    and other relevant hardware/software data. This functionality is primarily used
    within exception handling routines to provide diagnostic information when crashes
    or errors occur in the TrinityCore server environment. The method assists developers
    and administrators in troubleshooting issues by capturing the state of the system
    at the time of an exception. It typically outputs this information to the console,
    log files, or debug output streams depending on the configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Exception Handler
    code: "try {\n    // Some code that might throw\n} catch (const std::exception&\
      \ e) {\n    WheatyExceptionReport report;\n    report.PrintSystemInfo();\n \
      \   // Additional error handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during crash reporting or manual
    exception handling within TrinityCore's debugging infrastructure. It may include
    platform-specific system calls to retrieve hardware details and should be used
    primarily in development or debug builds where detailed diagnostics are required.
  warnings: The output from this method can contain sensitive system information,
    so it should not be exposed in production environments without proper sanitization.
    Additionally, calling this method in high-frequency error scenarios may impact
    performance due to system enumeration operations.
