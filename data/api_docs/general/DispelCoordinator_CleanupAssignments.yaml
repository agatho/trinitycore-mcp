  class: DispelCoordinator
  method: CleanupAssignments
  signature: void DispelCoordinator::CleanupAssignments()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all active dispel assignments from the coordinator's internal tracking
    system.
  description: The CleanupAssignments method clears and resets the internal state
    of the DispelCoordinator by removing all currently assigned dispel targets and
    their associated data. This method is typically invoked during cleanup operations,
    such as when a creature or player is removed from the world, or when the coordinator
    needs to be reset before processing new assignments. It ensures that no stale
    or invalid dispel assignments remain in memory, preventing potential issues with
    duplicate or orphaned dispel operations. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations, making it a simple cleanup utility.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cleanup Usage
    code: 'DispelCoordinator coordinator;

      // ... assign some dispels ...

      coordinator.CleanupAssignments(); // Clear all assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before destroying a DispelCoordinator instance
    or when switching contexts to ensure no lingering references exist. It is not
    thread-safe and should only be called from the main game thread or within a controlled
    synchronization context.
  warnings: Calling this method while dispel operations are actively in progress may
    lead to undefined behavior or incomplete dispel effects. Ensure all ongoing dispels
    have completed or been canceled before invoking this cleanup routine.
