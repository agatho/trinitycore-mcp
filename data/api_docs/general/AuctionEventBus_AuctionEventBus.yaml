  class: AuctionEventBus
  method: AuctionEventBus
  signature: void AuctionEventBus::AuctionEventBus()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the AuctionEventBus class for handling auction-related
    events.
  description: The AuctionEventBus constructor initializes the event bus system responsible
    for managing and dispatching auction-related events within the TrinityCore server.
    This class likely serves as a central hub for coordinating various auction activities
    such as item listings, bids, purchases, and notifications. The initialization
    process sets up internal data structures and event handlers necessary for processing
    auction events in a multi-threaded environment typical of World of Warcraft servers.
    It prepares the system to receive and route auction-related messages between different
    subsystems like the auction house, player clients, and database components.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating an AuctionEventBus instance
    code: 'AuctionEventBus* eventBus = new AuctionEventBus();

      // The event bus is now ready to handle auction events

      // Example usage:

      eventBus->HandleAuctionItemAdded(itemGuid, bidderGuid);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of internal queues, thread-safe
    data structures, and event subscription mechanisms. It should be called during
    server startup or when the auction system is initialized. The class may implement
    RAII principles where the destructor handles cleanup of resources.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the full auction
    system architecture. Improper initialization can lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes when auction events are processed. The AuctionEventBus should typically
    be accessed through singleton patterns or dependency injection in TrinityCore.
