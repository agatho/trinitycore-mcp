  class: Creature
  method: GetTapList
  signature: const int & Creature::GetTapList() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the list of players who have tapped the creature.
  description: The GetTapList method retrieves the list of players who have successfully
    tapped the creature, which is essential for determining loot distribution and
    player engagement in World of Warcraft. This method is commonly used in creature
    AI systems to track which players have contributed to the creature's damage or
    have been involved in its kill. The tap list typically includes players who have
    dealt damage to the creature or have been involved in its death, and it is crucial
    for determining loot distribution and player engagement during creature combat.
    This method returns a const reference to an integer representing the tap list,
    which can be used to determine if a player has contributed to the creature's kill.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a const reference to an integer representing the tap list of players
    who have tapped the creature. The value represents the number of players who have
    contributed to the creature's damage or have been involved in its kill, and can
    be used to determine loot distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Creature* creature = GetCreature();\nconst int& tapList = creature->GetTapList();\n\
      if (tapList > 0)\n{\n    // Player has contributed to the creature's kill\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Creature class and is typically used in conjunction
    with other creature-related methods for determining player engagement and loot
    distribution. Performance considerations include checking the tap list for each
    player involved in combat.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may not always reflect the
    actual player engagement, especially in cases where players have been involved
    in the creature's death but not necessarily contributed to damage.
