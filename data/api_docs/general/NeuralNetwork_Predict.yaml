  method: Predict
  signature: int NeuralNetwork::Predict(const int & input)
documentation:
  brief: Performs a prediction using the neural network model with the provided input
    value
  description: 'The Predict method executes a forward pass through the trained neural
    network to compute an output prediction based on the given input. This method
    is typically used in AI-driven game systems such as NPC behavior decision making,
    combat strategy calculations, or dynamic difficulty adjustment. The input parameter
    represents the feature vector or scalar value that the neural network processes
    to generate a result. The method assumes the neural network has been properly
    initialized and trained before calling this function. Precondition: Neural network
    must be in a valid state with loaded weights and biases. Postcondition: Returns
    an integer prediction value representing the computed output of the neural network.'
  parameters:
  - name: input
    description: The input value to be processed by the neural network for prediction.
      This is typically a scalar feature or normalized input value that represents
      game state data such as health percentage, mana level, distance to target, or
      other relevant metrics.
  returns: Returns an integer prediction value that represents the output of the neural
    network computation. The specific meaning of this value depends on the neural
    network's training and purpose - it could represent a decision index, action choice,
    probability score, or any other quantized result from the model's output layer.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Neural Network Prediction
    code: 'int prediction = myNeuralNetwork.Predict(75);

      // Returns predicted action or value based on input health percentage

      std::cout << "Predicted action: " << prediction << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Prediction in Game Logic
    code: "int healthPercentage = player->GetHealthPct();\nint predictedAction = neuralNet.Predict(healthPercentage);\n\
      switch(predictedAction) {\n    case 0: player->CastSpell(SPELL_HEAL); break;\n\
      \    case 1: player->CastSpell(SPELL_RUN); break;\n    case 2: player->CastSpell(SPELL_FLEE);\
      \ break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The neural network must be properly initialized with trained weights before
    calling Predict. This method is typically non-blocking but may involve computational
    overhead depending on network complexity. The input value should be normalized
    to match the training data distribution for optimal results. Consider caching
    or batching predictions if performance becomes an issue in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Calling Predict without proper initialization of the neural network will
    likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure input values are within
    expected ranges to avoid unexpected outputs. The method does not validate input
    parameters, so invalid inputs may produce meaningless results.
