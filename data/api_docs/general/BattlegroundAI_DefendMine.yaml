  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: DefendMine
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::DefendMine(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the battleground AI should defend a mine resource.
  description: The DefendMine method evaluates if the AI-controlled faction should
    prioritize defending a mine resource during battleground operations. This method
    is typically invoked by the battleground AI system to make strategic decisions
    about resource protection. It checks various conditions such as ownership status,
    player presence, and tactical importance of the mine. The method returns true
    if the mine should be defended, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial
    for maintaining control over key resources in battlegrounds like Warsong Gulch
    or Arathi Basin.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the mine should be defended by the AI faction, false if
    it should not be prioritized for defense.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground AI Logic
    code: "if (bgAI->DefendMine(nullptr)) {\n    // Execute mine defense strategy\n\
      \    bgAI->SetDefenseStrategy(DEFENSE_MINE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal battleground state tracking and
    may depend on the current phase of the battleground. The AI decision-making process
    for defending mines typically considers factors like proximity to player activity,
    mine ownership status, and strategic value.
  warnings: The method signature indicates a pointer parameter that is not used in
    the documented version, suggesting either incomplete implementation or a legacy
    interface. Ensure proper initialization of the battleground AI before calling
    this method.
