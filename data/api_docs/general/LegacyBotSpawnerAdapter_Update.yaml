  class: LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter
  method: Update
  signature: void LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the legacy bot spawner state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing the internal logic
    of the LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter class. It handles spawning and managing legacy
    bots within the game world, typically called from the main game loop with a time
    delta parameter. This method ensures that bot spawning intervals are properly
    managed and that any necessary cleanup or state updates occur based on the elapsed
    time since the last update. The implementation likely checks for conditions such
    as available spawn points, server load, and configuration limits to determine
    when and how many bots should be spawned.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed (in milliseconds) since the last update call. This
      value is used to determine if enough time has passed to trigger bot spawning
      logic or other time-based operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter spawner;

      spawner.Update(1000); // Update with 1 second elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    botSpawner.Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Other update logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main game world update loop and
    should be invoked regularly to maintain proper bot spawning behavior. The 'diff'
    parameter must accurately reflect real-time passage for correct timing of bot
    spawns.
  warnings: Improper handling of the 'diff' parameter can cause incorrect bot spawn
    rates or timing issues. This method should not be called from multiple threads
    without proper synchronization.
