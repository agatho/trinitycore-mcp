  class: PlayerPatternRecognition
  method: GetCurrentMetaPatterns
  signature: int PlayerPatternRecognition::GetCurrentMetaPatterns() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current meta patterns count associated with the player's pattern
    recognition system.
  description: The GetCurrentMetaPatterns method returns an integer value representing
    the number of meta patterns currently recognized or active for the player. In
    the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this method is typically
    used within crafting and profession systems where players can discover and track
    various pattern combinations. The returned value reflects the cumulative count
    of all meta patterns that have been unlocked or identified by the player through
    gameplay activities such as crafting, quest completion, or other in-game achievements.
    This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of meta patterns currently recognized
    by the player. A value of zero indicates no meta patterns have been discovered
    yet, while positive integers indicate the count of discovered patterns. The return
    value is always non-negative.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int metaPatterns = player->GetPatternRecognition()->GetCurrentMetaPatterns();\n\
      if (metaPatterns > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player has discovered \" << metaPatterns\
      \ << \" meta patterns.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Crafting System
    code: "void PlayerPatternRecognition::OnCraftingSuccess(ItemTemplate const* itemTemplate)\n\
      {\n    int currentPatterns = GetCurrentMetaPatterns();\n    if (currentPatterns\
      \ >= 10)\n    {\n        // Unlock advanced crafting ability\n        player->AddAchievementCriteria(ACHIEVEMENT_CRITERIA_TYPE_COMPLETE_QUEST,\
      \ 500);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during gameplay events such as crafting completion
    or quest progression. It's important to note that the returned value may vary
    based on the player's current progress in the game's profession and crafting systems.
    The implementation likely involves checking internal data structures that track
    pattern discovery states.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerPatternRecognition object is properly initialized
    before calling this method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Also, be aware that meta patterns may not persist across server restarts
    unless explicitly saved to the database.
