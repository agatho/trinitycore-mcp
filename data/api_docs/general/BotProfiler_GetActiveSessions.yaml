documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of currently active bot sessions managed by the profiler
  description: The GetActiveSessions method retrieves the number of bot sessions that
    are currently active within the system. This count represents how many bots are
    actively running or processing tasks at the time of the call. The method is typically
    used for monitoring and debugging purposes to understand the current load or state
    of bot operations. It does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from
    any thread context.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of active bot sessions currently
    being tracked by the BotProfiler instance. Returns zero if no sessions are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int activeCount = profiler.GetActiveSessions();\nif (activeCount > 0) {\n\
      \    std::cout << \"There are \" << activeCount << \" active bot sessions.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Monitoring Active Sessions
    code: "void MonitorBotActivity() {\n    static int lastCount = 0;\n    int currentCount\
      \ = profiler.GetActiveSessions();\n    if (currentCount != lastCount) {\n  \
      \      LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Active bot sessions changed from {} to {}\", lastCount,\
      \ currentCount);\n        lastCount = currentCount;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple read operation on an internal counter. It is
    designed to be lightweight and fast, making it suitable for frequent calls in
    performance-sensitive contexts. The returned value may change between consecutive
    calls as bot sessions start or end.
