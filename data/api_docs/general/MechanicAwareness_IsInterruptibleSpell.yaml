  class: MechanicAwareness
  method: IsInterruptibleSpell
  signature: bool MechanicAwareness::IsInterruptibleSpell(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell can be interrupted by external effects.
  description: The IsInterruptibleSpell method checks if a given spell ID corresponds
    to a spell that is susceptible to interruption from external factors such as damage
    or specific mechanics. This functionality is crucial for game logic involving
    spell casting, combat interactions, and player behavior. The method typically
    evaluates internal spell properties and mechanics to determine interruptibility
    status. It's commonly used in AI systems, combat handlers, and spell effect processors
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to evaluate for interruptibility.
      This should correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell can be interrupted by external effects,
    false otherwise. Spells that are typically non-interruptible include certain defensive
    abilities, instant cast spells, or those with specific mechanics that prevent
    interruption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->IsInterruptibleSpell(12345)) {\n    // Spell can\
      \ be interrupted\n    printf(\"Spell is interruptible\\n\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Spell cannot be interrupted\n    printf(\"Spell is not interruptible\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Logic Integration
    code: "void Player::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    if (!mechanicAwareness->IsInterruptibleSpell(spellInfo->Id))\
      \ {\n        // Handle non-interruptible spell logic\n        SendSystemMessage(\"\
      This spell cannot be interrupted!\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely relies on internal spell flags or mechanics database entries
    to determine interruptibility. Developers should ensure that spell IDs passed
    to this method are valid and exist in the game's spell database. Performance is
    generally good as it's a simple lookup operation, but frequent calls may impact
    performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Passing invalid spell IDs may result in undefined behavior or incorrect
    return values. Ensure all spell IDs used are validated against the game's spell
    database before calling this method. Some spells might be marked as interruptible
    even when they shouldn't be due to incomplete data or missing mechanics definitions.
