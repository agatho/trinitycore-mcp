  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: SetCoordinatorProfile
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::SetCoordinatorProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const
    FarmingCoordinatorProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the farming coordinator profile for a specified player.
  description: The SetCoordinatorProfile method is used to assign or update a FarmingCoordinatorProfile
    for a given player identified by their GUID. This method likely stores or modifies
    player-specific farming settings, such as crop preferences, resource allocation,
    or other gameplay-related configurations within the farming system. It is typically
    invoked when a player's farming behavior or preferences need to be adjusted, either
    through in-game actions or administrative commands. The profile data passed into
    this method is expected to contain all necessary configuration details for the
    farming coordinator to function properly for that specific player.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose farming coordinator
      profile will be updated. This value must correspond to a valid player in the
      game database.
  - name: profile
    description: An instance of FarmingCoordinatorProfile containing the new settings
      or configuration for the specified player's farming behavior. This object should
      include all relevant parameters required by the farming system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      FarmingCoordinatorProfile profile;

      profile.cropType = CROP_WHEAT;

      profile.resourceAllocation = 50;

      coordinator.SetCoordinatorProfile(12345, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player Profile with New Settings
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      FarmingCoordinatorProfile newProfile;

      newProfile.cropType = CROP_CARROT;

      newProfile.irrigationLevel = IRRIGATION_HIGH;

      newProfile.fertilizerType = FERTILIZER_ORGANIC;

      coordinator.SetCoordinatorProfile(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(), newProfile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal data structures or databases to
    persist player-specific farming configurations. It may trigger updates in the
    game world or UI elements reflecting the new profile settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided playerGuid corresponds to an active player, as
    invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or database inconsistencies. Also,
    make sure the profile object is properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid unexpected results.
