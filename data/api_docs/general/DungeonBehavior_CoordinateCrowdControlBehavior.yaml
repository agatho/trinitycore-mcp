  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CoordinateCrowdControlBehavior
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateCrowdControlBehavior(Player * cc, const
    DungeonEncounter & encounter)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates crowd control behavior for a player during a dungeon encounter.
  description: The CoordinateCrowdControlBehavior method manages and synchronizes
    the application of crowd control effects on a player within the context of a dungeon
    encounter. It ensures that player actions are properly handled when affected by
    crowd control mechanics, such as stuns, fears, or other disabling effects. This
    method likely integrates with the broader dungeon AI system to maintain proper
    encounter flow and player state management during combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: cc
    description: Pointer to the Player object that is currently under crowd control
      effects. This parameter represents the target of the crowd control behavior.
  - name: encounter
    description: Reference to the DungeonEncounter object that defines the current
      encounter context. This provides information about the specific boss or encounter
      the player is engaged with, including encounter state and mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Encounter Handler
    code: "void MyDungeonAI::OnPlayerCCApplied(Player* player, const DungeonEncounter&\
      \ encounter)\n{\n    CoordinateCrowdControlBehavior(player, encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom CC Logic
    code: "void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateCrowdControlBehavior(Player* cc, const\
      \ DungeonEncounter& encounter)\n{\n    if (!cc || !encounter.IsValid())\n  \
      \      return;\n    \n    // Apply cooldown or state changes\n    cc->SetCrowdControlState(CROWD_CONTROL_ACTIVE);\n\
      \    \n    // Notify other systems about the CC event\n    sScriptMgr->OnPlayerCCApplied(cc,\
      \ encounter);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that handles encounter-specific
    behaviors. It may be called from multiple locations within the dungeon logic to
    ensure consistent handling of player crowd control states across different mechanics
    and encounters.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer and DungeonEncounter reference are valid
    before calling this method, as invalid pointers can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. The method does not perform null checks internally.
