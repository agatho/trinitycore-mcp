  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetDuration
  signature: int DynamicObject::GetDuration() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining duration in milliseconds of the dynamic object
  description: The GetDuration method retrieves the time remaining before the dynamic
    object expires and is removed from the world. This value represents how much longer
    the object will persist, typically measured in milliseconds. Dynamic objects in
    TrinityCore are used for effects like area-of-effect spells, traps, or other temporary
    game elements that have a limited lifespan. The returned value decreases over
    time until it reaches zero, at which point the dynamic object is automatically
    destroyed by the server.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the remaining duration of the dynamic object in
    milliseconds. Returns 0 when the object has expired or been removed.
  examples:
  - title: Check if dynamic object is still active
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = ...; // obtained from spell effect\nif (dynObj->GetDuration()\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Object is still active, do something\n    uint32 remainingTime\
      \ = dynObj->GetDuration();\n    // Use remainingTime for UI updates or logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement custom behavior based on duration
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;\nint duration = dynObj->GetDuration();\nif\
      \ (duration > 5000) // More than 5 seconds remaining\n{\n    // Do something\
      \ for long-lasting effects\n}\nelse if (duration <= 1000) // Less than or equal\
      \ to 1 second\n{\n    // Trigger special effect on expiration\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The duration value is managed internally by the server and decrements automatically.
    This method does not modify the object's state, only retrieves its current value.
    The returned value may be zero if the object has already expired or been destroyed.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this value in time-sensitive operations as it changes
    continuously. Do not assume that a non-zero duration means the object will remain
    active for the full duration due to potential server-side modifications or removals.
