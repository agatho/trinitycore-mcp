  class: ControlZoneHandler
  method: HandleNeutralEvent
  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::HandleNeutralEvent(GameObject * controlZone)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a neutral control zone object is triggered, typically
    used in battleground or arena scenarios to update team ownership.
  description: The HandleNeutralEvent method processes the activation of a neutral
    control zone GameObject within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. This
    function is typically invoked when a player interacts with or enters a control
    point that does not currently belong to either team. The method updates the ownership
    state of the control zone, potentially triggering related events such as score
    changes, objective captures, or visual feedback for players in the area. It serves
    as part of the core battleground system logic where control zones determine territorial
    dominance and contribute to match outcomes.
  parameters:
  - name: controlZone
    description: A pointer to the GameObject representing the neutral control zone
      that has been activated. This object must be a valid control point with appropriate
      data set for ownership tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in battleground event handling
    code: "void MyBattleground::OnPlayerEnterControlZone(Player* player, GameObject*\
      \ controlZone)\n{\n    if (controlZone->GetGOInfo()->type == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_CONTROL_ZONE)\n\
      \    {\n        ControlZoneHandler handler;\n        handler.HandleNeutralEvent(controlZone);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GameObject passed in is a valid control zone
    and may perform internal checks to ensure proper state transitions. It should
    only be called from within appropriate battleground or arena contexts where control
    zones are expected.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GameObject pointer can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the controlZone parameter is validated before
    calling this function, especially in custom battleground implementations.
