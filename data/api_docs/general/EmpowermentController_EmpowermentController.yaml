  brief: Initializes an EmpowermentController instance with a specified EvokerAI owner.
  description: The EmpowermentController constructor initializes a new empowerment
    controller instance, associating it with a given EvokerAI object. This controller
    is responsible for managing the evoker's empowerment mechanics, including tracking
    empowered spells and handling their effects during combat. The method sets up
    internal state and references necessary for the AI to properly execute empowered
    abilities based on game conditions and spell availability.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'EvokerAI* evoker = new EvokerAI();

      EmpowermentController controller(evoker);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during AI initialization or when an
    evoker NPC is spawned. The EmpowermentController assumes the provided EvokerAI
    pointer is valid and will remain alive for the duration of the controller's use.
