  class: PerformanceOptimizer

  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::StartBenchmark(uint32_t botGuid, const std::string
    & benchmarkName)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a performance benchmark for a specific bot with the given name
  description: The StartBenchmark method begins recording performance metrics for
    a specified bot identified by its GUID. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's
    performance monitoring and optimization framework to track how different bot behaviors
    or AI decisions impact server performance. The benchmark data is collected and
    can be analyzed later to identify bottlenecks or optimize bot behavior. The method
    does not return any value but sets up internal tracking mechanisms for the specified
    benchmark name and bot GUID.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will be benchmarked. This
      should correspond to a valid bot entity in the game world.
  - name: benchmarkName
    description: A string identifier for the specific benchmark being started. This
      name is used to categorize and retrieve benchmark results later.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Benchmark Start
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      optimizer.StartBenchmark(botGuid, "MovementOptimization");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Benchmark with Dynamic Name
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string benchmarkName = "AI_" + std::to_string(botGuid);

      optimizer.StartBenchmark(botGuid, benchmarkName);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the PerformanceOptimizer instance has been properly
    initialized and is active. The benchmark data will be stored internally and may
    be flushed or reset depending on implementation details of the class. It's recommended
    to call this method before any performance-critical operations that need to be
    measured.
  warnings: Calling StartBenchmark without a valid bot GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or failed tracking. Ensure that the bot actually exists in the game world
    before starting a benchmark for it. Also, avoid calling this method too frequently
    as it might introduce overhead in high-frequency scenarios.
