documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the rights level of a guild bank slot or item.
  description: The GetRights method returns an int8 value representing the access
    rights associated with a specific guild bank slot or item. In the context of World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this value typically indicates what actions a guild
    member can perform on a particular bank slot, such as viewing, depositing, or
    withdrawing items. The rights are usually encoded in a bitmask format where different
    bit positions represent different permissions. This method is commonly used in
    conjunction with guild bank management systems to enforce access control and ensure
    that only members with appropriate permissions can interact with specific slots.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int8 value representing the rights level or permission mask for the
    guild bank slot. The exact meaning of each bit depends on the implementation,
    but typically includes values such as 0 (no access), 1 (view only), 2 (deposit
    only), 3 (full access), etc.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int8 rights = guildBankRightsAndSlots->GetRights();\nif (rights >= 3) {\n\
      \    // Member has full access to the bank slot\n    printf(\"Member has full\
      \ access\\n\");\n} else if (rights >= 1) {\n    // Member can view the slot\n\
      \    printf(\"Member can view the slot\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The return value is typically a bitmask that encodes multiple permissions.
    Developers should be aware of how these bits are interpreted in the specific TrinityCore
    version they are working with, as the exact mapping may vary between versions
    or custom modifications.
