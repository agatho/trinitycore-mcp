  signature: void RoleBasedCombatPositioning::UpdateStrategy(Player * bot, CombatPositionStrategy
    newStrategy)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat positioning strategy for a player bot based on their role
    in combat.
  description: The UpdateStrategy method adjusts the positioning behavior of a player
    bot within combat scenarios by applying a new CombatPositionStrategy. This method
    is typically used in AI-driven bot systems to dynamically modify how a bot positions
    itself relative to targets, allies, or environmental factors during encounters.
    The strategy update may influence movement patterns, targeting preferences, and
    tactical positioning decisions. It's designed to support role-based gameplay mechanics
    where different roles (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer) require distinct positioning
    behaviors. This method does not return any value but modifies the internal state
    of the bot's combat positioning system.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose combat positioning
      strategy will be updated. Must not be null.
  - name: newStrategy
    description: The new CombatPositionStrategy enum value that defines how the bot
      should position itself during combat. Valid values depend on the implementation
      but typically include strategies like 'Frontal', 'Flanking', 'Defensive', or
      'Aggressive'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a bot's strategy to flanking position
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      CombatPositionStrategy newStrategy = CombatPositionStrategy::Flanking;

      RoleBasedCombatPositioning::UpdateStrategy(myBot, newStrategy);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamically switch strategy based on combat situation
    code: "void SwitchToDefensiveMode(Player* bot) {\n    if (bot->GetHealthPercent()\
      \ < 30) {\n        RoleBasedCombatPositioning::UpdateStrategy(bot, CombatPositionStrategy::Defensive);\n\
      \    } else {\n        RoleBasedCombatPositioning::UpdateStrategy(bot, CombatPositionStrategy::Aggressive);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Player object is a valid bot instance
    with an active combat positioning system. The actual strategy implementation may
    vary depending on the specific AI module or plugin being used in the TrinityCore
    environment.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter points to a valid Player object, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. The method modifies internal state and should not
    be called during critical sections where thread safety is required.
