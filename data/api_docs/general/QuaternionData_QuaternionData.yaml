  method: QuaternionData
  signature: void QuaternionData::QuaternionData(float X, float Y, float Z, float
    W)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a QuaternionData object with specified X, Y, Z, and W components
    for representing 3D rotations.
  description: The QuaternionData constructor initializes a quaternion object using
    four floating-point values representing the X, Y, Z, and W components. Quaternions
    are commonly used in World of Warcraft for efficient 3D rotation calculations,
    avoiding gimbal lock issues that can occur with Euler angles. This constructor
    allows developers to create quaternion instances directly from component values,
    which is essential for character orientation, object positioning, and animation
    systems within the TrinityCore framework. The W component typically represents
    the scalar part of the quaternion, while X, Y, and Z represent the vector components.
  parameters:
  - name: X
    description: The x-component of the quaternion vector part, representing rotation
      around the x-axis
  - name: Y
    description: The y-component of the quaternion vector part, representing rotation
      around the y-axis
  - name: Z
    description: The z-component of the quaternion vector part, representing rotation
      around the z-axis
  - name: W
    description: The scalar component of the quaternion, typically representing the
      cosine of half the rotation angle
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a basic quaternion for 90-degree rotation around the Y-axis
    code: QuaternionData rotation(0.0f, 0.7071f, 0.0f, 0.7071f); // Represents 90-degree
      rotation around Y-axis
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a quaternion from Euler angles conversion
    code: 'float yaw = 45.0f * M_PI / 180.0f; // Convert to radians

      float pitch = 30.0f * M_PI / 180.0f;

      float roll = 0.0f;

      // Assuming helper function exists for Euler to quaternion conversion

      QuaternionData orientation = ConvertEulerToQuaternion(pitch, yaw, roll);'
    language: cpp
  notes: Quaternions should typically be normalized (unit length) for proper rotation
    representation. The constructor does not automatically normalize the input values,
    so developers must ensure they are valid for their intended use case. In TrinityCore's
    context, these quaternions may be used for character orientation, spell effects,
    or object positioning in 3D space.
  warnings: Incorrect quaternion components can lead to unexpected rotation behavior
    or visual artifacts in game objects. Always validate that quaternion values represent
    valid rotations before using them in gameplay systems. Be cautious when directly
    assigning floating-point values without proper normalization or conversion from
    other representations.
