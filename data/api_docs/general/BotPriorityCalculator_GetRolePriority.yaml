  class: BotPriorityCalculator
  method: GetRolePriority
  signature: uint32 BotPriorityCalculator::GetRolePriority(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the priority value for a bot's role within the group.
  description: The GetRolePriority method determines the strategic importance or priority
    level of a specific bot based on its assigned role in the group. This priority
    value is used by the bot management system to make decisions regarding assignment,
    behavior, and resource allocation. The method evaluates various factors such as
    the bot's class, specialization, current group composition, and gameplay requirements
    to compute an appropriate priority score. It ensures that bots are properly prioritized
    for tasks like tanking, healing, or damage dealing according to the needs of the
    group.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or index
      within the system. This parameter is expected to be a valid reference to a bot
      entity in the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the calculated priority of the specified
    bot's role. Higher values indicate higher strategic priority, while lower values
    suggest less critical roles or support functions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int botId = 5;

      uint32 priority = calculator.GetRolePriority(&botId);

      // priority now contains the calculated role priority for bot with ID 5'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Management System
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < botCount; ++i)\n{\n    int* botPtr = &botIds[i];\n\
      \    uint32 priority = calculator.GetRolePriority(botPtr);\n    if (priority\
      \ > highestPriority)\n    {\n        highestPriority = priority;\n        topBot\
      \ = *botPtr;\n    }\n}\n// Determines which bot has the highest role priority\
      \ in the group"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during group formation or when re-evaluating
    bot assignments. The implementation may cache results for performance reasons,
    so repeated calls with the same bot parameter might return cached values. Ensure
    that the bot pointer passed to this method points to a valid bot entity before
    calling.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to the bot parameter will likely result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that the bot exists and is properly
    initialized before invoking this method.
