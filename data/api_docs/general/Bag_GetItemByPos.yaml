  signature: int * Bag::GetItemByPos(int slot) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item GUID at the specified bag slot position.
  description: The GetItemByPos method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of an
    item located at a specific slot within a bag. This method is commonly used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to access items stored in
    player inventories or containers. The method takes a slot index as input and returns
    a pointer to the item's GUID, which can be used to identify and manipulate the
    item in the game world. It's important to note that this method does not perform
    bounds checking on the slot parameter, so invalid slot indices may result in undefined
    behavior or memory access violations.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The zero-based index of the bag slot from which to retrieve the item
      GUID. Valid values typically range from 0 to the maximum number of slots in
      the bag minus one.
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the item at the specified
    slot position, or nullptr if no item exists at that slot.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve item GUID from a specific bag slot
    code: "Bag* myBag = player->GetBag(0);\nint* itemGuid = myBag->GetItemByPos(5);\n\
      if (itemGuid != nullptr) {\n    // Item exists at slot 5, use *itemGuid to access\
      \ the GUID\n    uint64 itemId = *itemGuid;\n    // Process the item...\n} else\
      \ {\n    // No item found at slot 5\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate through all bag slots to find a specific item
    code: "Bag* inventory = player->GetBag(0);\nfor (int i = 0; i < inventory->GetBagSize();\
      \ ++i) {\n    int* itemGuid = inventory->GetItemByPos(i);\n    if (itemGuid\
      \ != nullptr && *itemGuid == targetItemId) {\n        // Found the target item\
      \ at slot i\n        printf(\"Found item at slot %d\\n\", i);\n        break;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a pointer to an internal data member, so the returned
    value should not be modified directly. The method assumes that the caller has
    already validated that the bag is valid and that the slot index is within acceptable
    bounds. Performance-wise, this operation is O(1) as it directly accesses an array
    element by index.
  warnings: Do not dereference the returned pointer without checking for null. Accessing
    invalid slot indices can lead to memory corruption or crashes. This method does
    not perform any validation on the input parameter, so callers must ensure the
    slot value is valid before invoking this method.
