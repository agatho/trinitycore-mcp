  signature: void GroupCoordination::HandleCrowdControl(const int & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Applies crowd control effects to a specified number of targets within the
    group coordination framework
  description: The HandleCrowdControl method manages the application and handling
    of crowd control mechanics for a defined set of targets within the group coordination
    system. This method is typically invoked during group-based encounters or player
    interactions where controlling enemy behavior is necessary. It processes the target
    count parameter to determine how many entities should be affected by the crowd
    control effect, ensuring proper synchronization across the group's coordination
    state. The implementation likely integrates with TrinityCore's existing combat
    and AI systems to maintain consistent gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: targets
    description: An integer reference specifying the number of targets to apply crowd
      control effects to. Valid values are typically non-negative integers representing
      active group members or enemies within range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Crowd Control Application
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      int targetCount = 3;

      coordination.HandleCrowdControl(targetCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Count Handling
    code: 'GroupCoordination coordination;

      int dynamicTargets = GetActiveEnemiesInRadius(10.0f);

      coordination.HandleCrowdControl(dynamicTargets);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal group state tracking and may require
    the group to be in a valid combat or coordination state before execution. Performance
    considerations should account for processing multiple targets efficiently, especially
    in high-density scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of target counts may lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect application of crowd control effects. Ensure
    that the target count does not exceed available entities within the group's scope.
