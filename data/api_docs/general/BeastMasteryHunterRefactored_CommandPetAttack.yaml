  class: BeastMasteryHunterRefactored
  method: CommandPetAttack
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::CommandPetAttack(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Orders the hunter's pet to attack a specified target.
  description: The CommandPetAttack method initiates an attack command for the hunter's
    beast companion, instructing it to engage a specific target. This method is typically
    used in the context of beast mastery hunter gameplay mechanics where the player
    controls their pet's actions directly. The method likely updates the pet's AI
    state and target selection, triggering the pet to begin attacking the provided
    target. It may also handle combat initialization, threat generation, or other
    related pet behavior modifications.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      for the pet to attack. This parameter is expected to be a valid target reference
      within the game world context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Attack Command
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      BeastMasteryHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.CommandPetAttack(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI system and combat state management.
    It may require that the pet is currently under the player's control and that the
    target is valid and within range.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid game object or entity
    before calling this method, as invalid targets could cause undefined behavior
    or crashes in the AI system.
