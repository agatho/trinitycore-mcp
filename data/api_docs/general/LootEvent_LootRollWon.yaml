api:
  class: LootEvent
  method: LootRollWon
  signature: LootEvent LootEvent::LootRollWon(int winner, int item, uint32 entry)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a LootEvent object representing a loot roll win condition
    with specified winner, item, and entry values.
  description: 'The LootRollWon method is used to generate a LootEvent instance that
    signifies when a player has won a loot roll for a specific item. This event typically
    occurs during World of Warcraft''s loot distribution system, particularly in scenarios
    such as group loot or disenchanting. The method takes three parameters: the winner''s
    identifier (player ID), the item being rolled for, and the entry ID associated
    with the loot. It returns a fully initialized LootEvent object that can be used
    to trigger appropriate game logic, notifications, or logging within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is essential for maintaining accurate loot tracking and
    ensuring proper event handling during player interactions with loot systems.'
  parameters:
  - name: winner
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who won the loot roll.
      This should be a valid player ID within the game world.
  - name: item
    description: The item identifier representing the specific item that was won in
      the loot roll. This typically corresponds to an item template or database entry.
  - name: entry
    description: The loot entry ID associated with the item being rolled for. This
      identifies which specific loot group or table the item belongs to within the
      game's loot system.
  returns: A LootEvent object representing the successful loot roll win condition,
    initialized with the provided winner, item, and entry parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: LootEvent event = LootEvent::LootRollWon(12345, 67890, 54321);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player Loot Handling
    code: "void HandlePlayerLootWin(Player* player, uint32 itemId, uint32 lootEntry)\n\
      {\n    LootEvent event = LootEvent::LootRollWon(player->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ itemId, lootEntry);\n    // Process the event further\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's loot system architecture and should
    be used in conjunction with proper loot roll management. The returned LootEvent
    object can be queued for processing or directly handled by systems that listen
    for loot-related events. Ensure that the parameters provided are valid identifiers
    to prevent runtime errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the winner parameter corresponds to an active player in the
    game world, as invalid GUIDs may cause unexpected behavior. Also, verify that
    item and entry values match existing database entries to avoid data inconsistencies.
