documentation:
  brief: Checks if soul shards are available for use in the SoulShardSystem
  description: The available() method determines whether the player has any soul shards
    that can be consumed or used within the SoulShardSystem. This method typically
    checks the internal state of the system to verify if there are valid soul shards
    ready for consumption, such as those generated by spell effects like Soul Fire
    or other abilities that produce soul shards. The check considers both the existence
    and usability of soul shards, ensuring they are not in a cooldown or invalid state.
    This is commonly used before attempting to consume soul shards for spells or abilities
    that require them.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if there are usable soul shards available in the system, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when no soul shards exist or when all soul
    shards are currently unusable due to cooldowns or other restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage check
    code: "if (player->GetSoulShardSystem()->available()) {\n    // Proceed with soul\
      \ shard consuming spell\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SOUL_SHARD_CONSUME,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spell casting logic
    code: "class WarlockPlayer {\npublic:\n    bool CastSoulFire(Unit* target) {\n\
      \        if (!GetSoulShardSystem()->available()) {\n            SendSpellFailed(SPELL_FAILED_NO_SOUL_SHARDS);\n\
      \            return false;\n        }\n        // Proceed with casting Soul\
      \ Fire\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to consume soul shards
    to avoid errors. The availability check may be affected by cooldowns, spell restrictions,
    or other game mechanics that temporarily prevent shard usage. Implementation likely
    involves checking internal counters or state flags rather than direct database
    queries.
  warnings: Do not assume that a positive return value guarantees immediate consumption
    success, as the system state might change between the availability check and actual
    consumption. Always validate the system state before performing operations that
    consume soul shards.
