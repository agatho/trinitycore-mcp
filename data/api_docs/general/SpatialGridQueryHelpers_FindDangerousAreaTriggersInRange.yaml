api:
  class: SpatialGridQueryHelpers
  method: FindDangerousAreaTriggersInRange
  signature: int SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDangerousAreaTriggersInRange(Player
    * bot, float range)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the count of dangerous area triggers within a specified
    range of the player.
  description: The FindDangerousAreaTriggersInRange method searches for area triggers
    in the world that are classified as dangerous (such as those that cause damage
    or have harmful effects) within a given range around the player. It iterates through
    the spatial grid system to locate these triggers and returns their count. This
    functionality is commonly used by AI bots or game systems to assess environmental
    hazards near a player. The method relies on the player's current position and
    the configured range to determine which triggers are in proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which to search for dangerous area
      triggers.
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the player's position to search
      for dangerous area triggers.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of dangerous area triggers found
    within the specified range. A return value of zero indicates no such triggers
    were found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int count = SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDangerousAreaTriggersInRange(player,
      10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with AI Bot Logic
    code: "if (SpatialGridQueryHelpers::FindDangerousAreaTriggersInRange(bot, 25.0f)\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Avoid dangerous area\n    bot->MoveToSafeLocation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the spatial grid system for efficient lookup of nearby triggers.
    It is optimized to avoid full world traversal and instead queries only relevant
    grid cells based on player position and range.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method, as
    passing a null pointer may result in undefined behavior. Also note that the range
    parameter should be positive; negative values may lead to unexpected results or
    performance issues.
