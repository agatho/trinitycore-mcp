  class: CreatureAI
  method: CreatureAI
  signature: void CreatureAI::CreatureAI(Creature * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a CreatureAI instance with the specified creature and script
    ID.
  description: The CreatureAI constructor initializes the AI behavior for a creature
    by associating it with a specific script ID. This method sets up the internal
    state of the AI system to manage the creature's behavior according to the provided
    script configuration. The script ID typically corresponds to a predefined AI script
    that defines how the creature should act in various situations such as combat,
    movement, or interaction with players. This initialization is crucial for enabling
    scripted AI behaviors within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object this AI instance will control. Must
      not be null and should point to a valid creature in the game world.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Integer identifier that maps to a specific AI script configuration.
      This ID determines which behavior patterns and actions the creature will follow
      during its lifetime.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CreatureAI Initialization
    code: CreatureAI* ai = new CreatureAI(creature, 12345);
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing AI with Script ID from Database
    code: 'uint32 scriptId = creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->AIName;

      CreatureAI* ai = new CreatureAI(creature, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The constructor does not perform any validation on the creature pointer or
    script ID. It is assumed that these values are valid and properly initialized
    before calling this constructor. The AI system relies heavily on proper initialization
    to function correctly in combat and other game scenarios.
  warnings: Passing a null creature pointer will likely cause undefined behavior or
    crashes. Ensure that the creature object is fully constructed and registered with
    the world before initializing its AI. Also, invalid script IDs may result in unexpected
    behavior or no AI functionality at all.
