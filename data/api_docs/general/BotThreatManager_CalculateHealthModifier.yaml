  signature: float BotThreatManager::CalculateHealthModifier(Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a health-based threat modifier for a given target
    unit.
  description: The CalculateHealthModifier method computes a float value that represents
    how a bot's threat level is influenced by the target unit's current health. This
    modifier is typically used in threat calculation systems to adjust the effectiveness
    of attacks or abilities based on the target's health percentage. The method likely
    takes into account factors such as whether the target is low health, critically
    injured, or at full health to determine an appropriate multiplier for threat generation.
    It is commonly invoked during AI decision-making processes when bots evaluate
    their combat actions and potential threat contributions.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the calculated health modifier. This value typically
    ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no threat contribution due to target
    health (e.g., if target is at full health), and 1.0 represents maximum threat
    contribution (e.g., when target is critically low on health). Values in between
    indicate proportional threat adjustments based on the relative health state of
    the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float modifier = botThreatManager->CalculateHealthModifier(targetUnit);

      // Use the modifier to adjust threat calculations

      float finalThreat = baseThreat * modifier;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger threat management system that dynamically
    adjusts bot behavior based on combat conditions. The exact implementation details
    may vary depending on the specific version of TrinityCore and the AI module being
    used.
