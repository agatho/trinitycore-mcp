documentation:
  brief: Processes a guild member rank assignment packet from the client.
  description: The HandleGuildAssignRank method handles incoming packets from players
    attempting to assign ranks to guild members. This method validates the player's
    permissions within the guild, ensures the target member exists, and updates the
    guild member's rank accordingly. It is part of the core guild management functionality
    in TrinityCore, allowing guild leaders and officers to reassign ranks to members
    based on their authority level. The method performs necessary permission checks
    and sends appropriate responses back to the client indicating success or failure
    of the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic rank assignment handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildAssignRank(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildAssignMemberRank&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Method implementation would validate permissions and update\
      \ member rank\n    // This is a simplified example of what the method processes\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the WorldSession context, meaning it's called
    in response to client network messages. It requires proper guild membership validation
    and permission checks before modifying guild member data. The method likely interacts
    with the Guild::HandleGuildAssignRank internal logic for actual rank assignment.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to unauthorized rank changes
    within guilds, potentially allowing players to elevate themselves or others beyond
    their intended authority levels. Always validate player permissions and guild
    membership before processing rank assignments.
