  method: ~BehaviorCluster
  signature: void BehaviorCluster::~BehaviorCluster()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a BehaviorCluster instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BehaviorCluster class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used by the behavior
    cluster. This method is automatically invoked when a BehaviorCluster object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system,
    this ensures proper cleanup of behavior-related data structures and prevents memory
    leaks. The destructor typically handles releasing references to other objects,
    clearing internal lists or maps, and performing any necessary finalization tasks
    before the object is fully removed from memory.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BehaviorCluster
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BehaviorCluster cluster;\n    // ... use cluster\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when cluster goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BehaviorCluster pointer
    code: 'BehaviorCluster* cluster = new BehaviorCluster();

      // ... use cluster ...

      delete cluster; // Triggers destructor

      cluster = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    In most cases, the destructor is invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    objects are destroyed. BehaviorCluster may contain pointers to other AI components
    that need proper cleanup, so ensure all dependencies are handled correctly.
  warnings: Avoid calling this destructor manually unless you have a specific reason
    and understand the implications of direct object destruction. Ensure no other
    code holds references to the object being destroyed to prevent dangling pointer
    issues.
