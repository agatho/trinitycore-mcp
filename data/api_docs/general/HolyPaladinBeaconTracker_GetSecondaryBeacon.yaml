  method: GetSecondaryBeacon
  signature: int HolyPaladinBeaconTracker::GetSecondaryBeacon() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the GUID of the secondary beacon target for a Holy Paladin.
  description: The GetSecondaryBeacon method returns the unique identifier (GUID)
    of the target unit that is currently designated as the secondary beacon target
    for a Holy Paladin. This functionality is part of the Paladin's Beacon of Light
    ability, which allows the paladin to share healing with nearby allies. The secondary
    beacon typically represents the second most important target for healing distribution,
    often used in conjunction with the primary beacon. The method does not modify
    any state and simply retrieves the current beacon target GUID if one exists.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the GUID of the secondary beacon target.
    If no secondary beacon is set, the method returns 0, indicating no valid target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint64 secondaryBeaconGUID = paladin->GetSecondaryBeacon();\nif (secondaryBeaconGUID\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    Unit* target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*paladin, secondaryBeaconGUID);\n\
      \    if (target)\n        // Perform actions with the secondary beacon target\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the Beacon of Light mechanic
    and related healing tracking systems. The GUID returned represents a valid GameObject
    or Unit within the game world that can be accessed via ObjectAccessor.
