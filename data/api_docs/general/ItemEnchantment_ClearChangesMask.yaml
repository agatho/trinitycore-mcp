  signature: void ItemEnchantment::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the item enchantment, resetting its modified state
    flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of an
    ItemEnchantment object. This operation clears any flags that indicate which properties
    of the enchantment have been modified since the last synchronization with the
    client or database. It is typically used during save operations or when preparing
    to synchronize the enchantment state with the game world. The method ensures that
    subsequent checks for changes will not detect previously modified fields, effectively
    marking the enchantment as 'clean' or unmodified.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Changes Mask Before Saving
    code: "ItemEnchantment* enchant = player->GetItemEnchantment(0);\nif (enchant)\n\
      {\n    enchant->ClearChangesMask();\n    // Save the enchantment state to database\
      \ or send update packet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often called internally by TrinityCore's item management system
    when saving enchantments to prevent redundant updates. It does not modify the
    actual enchantment data, only the tracking of changes.
