  class: World
  method: IsClosed
  signature: bool World::IsClosed() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the world server is in a closed state, preventing new player
    connections.
  description: The IsClosed method determines if the world server has entered a closed
    state, typically during maintenance, shutdown, or when the maximum number of players
    has been reached. When the world is closed, new players cannot log in, although
    existing players may continue to play until their session ends. This method is
    commonly used by login systems and connection handlers to enforce server access
    policies. The state can be toggled through administrative commands or automatically
    during server shutdown sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the world server is currently closed and rejecting new
    connections; returns false if the server is open and accepting new player logins.
  examples:
  - title: Check Server Status Before Login
    code: "if (!sWorld->IsClosed()) {\n    // Allow player to proceed with login\n\
      \    player->SendLoginSettime();\n} else {\n    // Reject login attempt\n  \
      \  player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"Server is currently closed.\");\n\
      \    player->GetSession()->KickPlayer();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Prevent New Connections During Maintenance
    code: "void HandleServerShutdown() {\n    sWorld->SetClosed(true); // Close the\
      \ server\n    if (sWorld->IsClosed()) {\n        sLog->outString(\"Server is\
      \ now closed for maintenance.\");\n        // Notify all players\n        sWorld->SendServerMessage(SERVER_MSG_SHUTDOWN_TIME,\
      \ \"Maintenance in progress. Please log out.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    closed state is typically managed by the World object itself through administrative
    commands or server shutdown procedures.
  warnings: Be cautious when checking this flag in high-frequency loops as it may
    affect performance if used excessively. Also, ensure that existing player sessions
    are properly handled when closing the world to avoid abrupt disconnections.
