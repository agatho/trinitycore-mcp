  brief: Updates the weapon imbues for the shaman AI based on current combat state
    and available spells.
  description: The UpdateWeaponImbues method is responsible for managing and updating
    the weapon imbue effects applied to a shaman's main and off-hand weapons. This
    method evaluates the current combat situation, available spell effects, and the
    shaman's current mana levels to determine which weapon imbues should be active.
    It ensures that the most beneficial imbue combinations are maintained based on
    the tactical needs of the encounter. The method typically runs during AI update
    cycles and may be triggered by specific combat events or periodic checks.

    code: "void ShamanAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdateWeaponImbues();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the shaman AI's periodic update
    routine. It relies on the shaman's current spell availability and combat state
    to make decisions about which imbues to apply. The implementation may vary based
    on the specific shaman specialization (Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration).
