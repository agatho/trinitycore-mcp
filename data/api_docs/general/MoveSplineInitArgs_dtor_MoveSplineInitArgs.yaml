documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MoveSplineInitArgs object and releases its allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the MoveSplineInitArgs class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during
    the initialization of movement splines. This is an essential part of the object's
    lifecycle management in TrinityCore's movement system, ensuring no memory leaks
    occur when objects go out of scope. The destructor typically handles cleanup of
    internal data structures such as waypoints, spline parameters, and other temporary
    buffers used for calculating character or creature movement paths.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'MoveSplineInitArgs args;

      // ... initialization code ...

      // Destructor automatically called when args goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when a MoveSplineInitArgs
    object is destroyed, either when it goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    It's important to note that this destructor does not need to be called manually
    in normal usage patterns.
