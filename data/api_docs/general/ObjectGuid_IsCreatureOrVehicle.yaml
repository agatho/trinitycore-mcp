documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the ObjectGuid represents a creature or vehicle entity.
  description: The IsCreatureOrVehicle method checks if the current ObjectGuid refers
    to a creature or vehicle type object within the World of Warcraft game world.
    This method evaluates the type portion of the GUID to determine if it matches
    the criteria for either a creature (type ID 3) or a vehicle (type ID 10). The
    check is performed using the ObjectGuid's internal type field and does not require
    any external data lookup. This functionality is commonly used in game logic to
    filter or process specific types of entities, particularly when handling AI behaviors,
    combat interactions, or vehicle-related mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents a creature or vehicle entity;
    otherwise returns false. A creature GUID has type ID 3 and a vehicle GUID has
    type ID 10 within the TrinityCore framework.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if an object is a creature or vehicle
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(12345);\nif (guid.IsCreatureOrVehicle())\
      \ {\n    // Handle creature or vehicle logic\n    printf(\"This is a creature\
      \ or vehicle\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle other object types\n    printf(\"\
      This is not a creature or vehicle\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a game event handler to filter targets
    code: "void OnPlayerSpellCast(Player* player, SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n\
      \    for (auto const& target : player->GetAttackers()) {\n        if (target->GetGUID().IsCreatureOrVehicle())\
      \ {\n            // Apply special effects or logic only to creatures and vehicles\n\
      \            DoSpecialCreatureEffect(target);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates purely on the GUID's type field without requiring database
    lookups or external state. The implementation relies on predefined constants for
    creature (HighGuid::Creature) and vehicle (HighGuid::Vehicle) types. Performance
    is optimal as it's a simple bitwise comparison operation.
  warnings: Be aware that this method only checks the type portion of the GUID, not
    the actual existence or validity of the object in the game world. A valid GUID
    may still represent a non-existent creature or vehicle if the object has been
    destroyed but the GUID hasn't been cleared yet.
