documentation:
  brief: Initializes query data for quest points of interest, setting up internal
    structures for quest-related spatial queries.
  description: The InitializeQueryData method prepares and initializes the internal
    data structures required for handling quest points of interest (POIs) within the
    TrinityCore framework. This method is typically invoked during the initialization
    phase of quest systems or when loading quest data from the database. It sets up
    necessary caches, registers relevant quest POI entries, and ensures that spatial
    query mechanisms are ready to handle quest-related location lookups. The method
    does not require any input parameters and performs its operations internally,
    preparing the QuestPOIData class for subsequent queries related to quest points
    of interest.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'QuestPOIData questPoiData;

      questPoiData.InitializeQueryData();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of the
    quest system. It is not thread-safe and must be executed in a single-threaded
    context to avoid race conditions. The internal structures initialized by this
    method are essential for efficient quest POI lookups, particularly when dealing
    with large numbers of quests or complex quest chains.
  warnings: Calling InitializeQueryData multiple times without proper cleanup may
    result in memory leaks or inconsistent internal state. Ensure that the method
    is only invoked once per QuestPOIData instance during its lifecycle.
