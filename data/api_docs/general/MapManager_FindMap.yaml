  signature: Map * MapManager::FindMap(uint32 mapId, uint32 instanceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a pointer to a specific map instance based on its ID and instance
    ID.
  description: The FindMap method is used to locate and return a pointer to a Map
    object within the TrinityCore server's map management system. It takes a map identifier
    (mapId) and an instance identifier (instanceId) as parameters, allowing for retrieval
    of both world maps and instance maps. The method performs a lookup in the internal
    map container, returning a valid Map pointer if the requested map exists, or nullptr
    if it does not. This functionality is essential for managing game world instances,
    player movement between different map zones, and ensuring that objects are correctly
    placed within their respective map contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map type (e.g., 0 for Eastern Kingdoms,
      1 for Kalimdor). This corresponds to the map entry in the database.
  - name: instanceId
    description: The instance identifier used to distinguish between different instances
      of the same map. For world maps, this is typically 0; for instances like dungeons
      or raids, this value identifies the specific instance.
  returns: A pointer to a Map object if the specified map and instance exist in the
    system. Returns nullptr if no matching map instance could be found.
  examples:
  - title: Find a World Map
    code: "Map* worldMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(0, 0); // Find the Eastern Kingdoms map\n\
      if (worldMap)\n{\n    // Use the map object\n    sLog->outString(\"Found world\
      \ map: %u\", worldMap->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Find a Dungeon Instance
    code: "uint32 dungeonId = 1234; // Example dungeon ID\nuint32 instanceId = 5678;\
      \ // Example instance ID\nMap* dungeonMap = sMapMgr->FindMap(dungeonId, instanceId);\n\
      if (dungeonMap)\n{\n    // Process the dungeon instance map\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found dungeon instance %u for map %u\", instanceId, dungeonId);\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to find dungeon instance %u for map %u\", instanceId,\
      \ dungeonId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread that has access
    to the MapManager singleton. The returned Map pointer should not be deleted or
    modified directly; it's managed by the MapManager system. Performance-wise, this
    lookup is generally fast due to internal hash maps used for indexing.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned Map pointer as it may become invalid
    if the map instance is destroyed (e.g., after a player leaves an instance). Always
    check for null returns before using the pointer to avoid crashes. Also note that
    this method does not create new maps; it only retrieves existing ones.
