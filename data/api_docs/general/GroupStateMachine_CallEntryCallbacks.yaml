    newState, GroupStateTransition transition)
documentation:
  brief: Invokes all registered entry callbacks for a group state transition.
  description: The CallEntryCallbacks method is responsible for executing all registered
    callback functions that are associated with entering a specific group state. This
    method is typically invoked during group state transitions to ensure that appropriate
    actions are taken when the group enters a new state, such as initializing resources,
    updating UI elements, or triggering game logic. The method takes into account
    the old state, new state, and the transition type to determine which callbacks
    should be executed. It's an integral part of the group management system in TrinityCore,
    enabling modular and extensible behavior for different group states.
  parameters:
  - name: oldState
    description: The previous state of the group before the transition occurred. This
      parameter determines which entry callbacks should be executed based on the transition
      path.
  - name: newState
    description: The new state that the group is transitioning into. This value is
      used to identify which entry callbacks are relevant for the current state change.
  - name: transition
    description: Represents the type of transition that occurred between the old and
      new states. This helps determine the appropriate callback execution order or
      conditions.
  returns: null

    code: "void example() {\n    GroupStateMachine stateMachine;\n    stateMachine.CallEntryCallbacks(GROUP_STATE_IDLE,\
      \ GROUP_STATE_COMBAT, TRANSITION_ENTER);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering Entry Callbacks for a Complex State Change
    code: "void handleGroupTransition(GroupState oldState, GroupState newState) {\n\
      \    GroupStateMachine stateMachine;\n    GroupStateTransition transition =\
      \ determineTransitionType(oldState, newState);\n    stateMachine.CallEntryCallbacks(oldState,\
      \ newState, transition);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that callbacks have been properly registered for the
    target states. It's important to ensure that all relevant entry callbacks are
    registered before calling this method to avoid missing critical state initialization
    logic.
  warnings: Improper registration of entry callbacks may lead to unexpected behavior
    or missing initialization steps during group state transitions. Ensure callback
    registration occurs before any transition events are processed.
