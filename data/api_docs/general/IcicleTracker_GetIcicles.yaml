  class: IcicleTracker
  method: GetIcicles
  signature: uint32 IcicleTracker::GetIcicles() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current count of icicles tracked by the IcicleTracker instance.
  description: The GetIcicles method retrieves the number of icicles currently being
    tracked within the IcicleTracker object. This method is typically used in the
    context of game mechanics involving ice-based abilities or environmental effects
    where tracking multiple icicles is necessary for gameplay logic. The returned
    value represents a non-negative integer indicating how many icicles are currently
    active or tracked. This method does not modify any internal state and is safe
    to call repeatedly without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of icicles currently tracked by
    this IcicleTracker instance. Returns zero if no icicles are being tracked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 icicleCount = tracker->GetIcicles();\nif (icicleCount > 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Process active icicles\n    printf(\"Tracking %u icicles\\n\", icicleCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Logic
    code: "class PlayerIcicleHandler\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdatePlayerIcicles(IcicleTracker*\
      \ tracker)\n    {\n        uint32 count = tracker->GetIcicles();\n        if\
      \ (count >= 5)\n        {\n            // Apply special effect when many icicles\
      \ are present\n            player_->ApplyAura(SPELL_ICICLE_OVERLOAD);\n    \
      \    }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is read-only and does not perform any locking or synchronization
    operations. It's recommended to use this method in contexts where thread safety
    is already guaranteed by the calling code. The performance impact is negligible
    as it only returns a cached value.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned count may change between calls if other methods
    modify the tracked icicles. If you need to maintain consistency across multiple
    operations, consider caching the result or using appropriate locking mechanisms.
