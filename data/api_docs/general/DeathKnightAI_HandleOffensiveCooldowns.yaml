  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: HandleOffensiveCooldowns
  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::HandleOffensiveCooldowns(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles offensive cooldowns for the Death Knight AI, determining if an offensive
    ability can be used against a target.
  description: The HandleOffensiveCooldowns method evaluates whether the Death Knight
    AI is ready to use an offensive ability on the specified target. It checks the
    current state of offensive cooldowns and determines if it's appropriate to execute
    an offensive spell or ability. This method is typically called during AI decision-making
    processes to ensure that abilities are used at optimal times, respecting their
    cooldown periods and game mechanics. The method returns true if an offensive action
    can be performed, false otherwise. It integrates with the overall AI logic to
    maintain proper ability usage timing and resource management.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the target against which
      the offensive cooldowns are being evaluated. Must not be null for valid operation.
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight AI can execute an offensive ability on
    the target, false if it's currently on cooldown or otherwise unable to perform
    the action.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (deathKnightAI->HandleOffensiveCooldowns(targetUnit)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ offensive ability\n    deathKnightAI->DoCast(targetUnit, SPELL_DEATH_COIL);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI update loop
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff) {\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    if (HandleOffensiveCooldowns(me->GetVictim())) {\n \
      \       // Use offensive ability\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_DEATH_STRIKE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI logic and should be called within the
    context of the AI update loop. It relies on internal cooldown tracking and may
    depend on other AI state variables. The method does not directly cast spells but
    rather determines readiness for offensive actions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as it could lead to undefined behavior. This method should only be
    called when the AI has a valid target to avoid incorrect cooldown evaluations.
