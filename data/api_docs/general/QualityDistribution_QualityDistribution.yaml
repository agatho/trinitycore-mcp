  class: QualityDistribution
  method: QualityDistribution
  signature: void QualityDistribution::QualityDistribution(uint32 min, uint32 max,
    float green, float blue, float purple)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes quality distribution parameters for item generation with specified
    minimum and maximum values and color thresholds.
  description: The QualityDistribution constructor initializes internal parameters
    used for determining item quality distribution in World of Warcraft's loot system.
    It sets up the minimum and maximum quality levels, along with green, blue, and
    purple quality thresholds that define how likely items are to appear at each quality
    level. This method is typically used during the initialization of loot tables
    or item generation systems within TrinityCore's framework. The parameters control
    the probability distribution of item qualities from poor (min) to legendary (max),
    with color thresholds determining the transition points between quality levels.
  parameters:
  - name: min
    description: The minimum quality level for items, typically representing poor
      quality (0) or common quality (1)
  - name: max
    description: The maximum quality level for items, typically representing legendary
      quality (5) or artifact quality (6)
  - name: green
    description: Threshold value determining the probability of green quality items
      (common quality), usually between 0.0 and 1.0
  - name: blue
    description: Threshold value determining the probability of blue quality items
      (uncommon quality), usually between 0.0 and 1.0
  - name: purple
    description: Threshold value determining the probability of purple quality items
      (rare quality), usually between 0.0 and 1.0
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Initialize standard item quality distribution
    code: 'QualityDistribution distribution(0, 5, 0.7f, 0.9f, 0.95f);

      // Sets up a typical WoW item quality distribution

      // min=0 (poor), max=5 (legendary)

      // green=70% chance, blue=90% chance, purple=95% chance'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure custom quality thresholds for rare loot
    code: 'QualityDistribution rareDistribution(1, 6, 0.8f, 0.92f, 0.98f);

      // Creates a distribution favoring higher quality items

      // Common (green) at 80%, Uncommon (blue) at 92%, Rare (purple) at 98%'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when creating
    new loot templates. The quality thresholds should be set in ascending order to
    ensure proper probability distribution. The min and max parameters define the
    range of possible qualities, while green, blue, and purple values determine the
    cumulative probabilities for each quality level.
  warnings: Incorrect ordering of threshold values can lead to unexpected quality
    distributions. Ensure that green <= blue <= purple for proper probability calculations.
    This method does not validate parameter ranges, so invalid inputs may produce
    unpredictable results.
