  class: GuildAchievementMgr
  method: LoadFromDB
  signature: void GuildAchievementMgr::LoadFromDB(int achievementResult, int criteriaResult)
documentation:
  brief: Loads guild achievement data from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadFromDB method initializes and populates the GuildAchievementMgr
    with achievement-related data retrieved from the database. This method is typically
    invoked during guild initialization or when loading guild information to ensure
    that all achievement progress and criteria are correctly restored. It processes
    the achievement results and criteria results passed as parameters, mapping them
    to internal structures for efficient access during gameplay. The method ensures
    that guild members' achievements are synchronized with the saved database state.
  parameters:
  - name: achievementResult
    description: Database result set containing guild achievement data including achievement
      IDs, completion status, and timestamps.
  - name: criteriaResult
    description: Database result set containing detailed criteria progress for each
      guild achievement, such as counts, completion flags, and associated timestamps.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Guild Initialization
    code: "void Guild::LoadGuildData()\n{\n    // Assume we have database connection\
      \ and prepared statements\n    QueryResult achievementResult = CharacterDatabase.Query(\"\
      SELECT * FROM guild_achievements WHERE guildid = {}\", GetId());\n    QueryResult\
      \ criteriaResult = CharacterDatabase.Query(\"SELECT * FROM guild_achievement_criteria\
      \ WHERE guildid = {}\", GetId());\n    \n    if (achievementResult && criteriaResult)\n\
      \    {\n        m_achievementMgr->LoadFromDB(achievementResult, criteriaResult);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after database connection is established
    and valid query results are available. The method assumes that the provided result
    sets contain properly formatted data matching the expected schema for guild achievements
    and criteria.
  warnings: Calling this method without valid database results may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required database tables (guild_achievements,
    guild_achievement_criteria) exist and contain appropriate data before invoking
    this method.
