documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AI decision timer instance and releases its associated resources.
  description: The ~AIDecisionTimer destructor is called automatically when an AIDecisionTimer
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any internal resources allocated by the AI decision timer, such as
    memory blocks, timers, or references to AI components. In the context of TrinityCore's
    AI system, this destructor plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks and
    maintaining stable AI behavior during creature lifecycle events. The destruction
    process typically involves unregistering the timer from any active AI systems
    and freeing up internal data structures without affecting other game objects or
    systems.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction of AIDecisionTimer
    code: "void SomeAIUpdateFunction() {\n    AIDecisionTimer timer;\n    // ... perform\
      \ AI decisions ...\n    // timer is automatically destroyed here when going\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit Deletion of AIDecisionTimer
    code: 'AIDecisionTimer* timer = new AIDecisionTimer();

      // ... use the timer ...

      delete timer; // Triggers destructor

      // timer is now destroyed and resources released'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when objects go
    out of scope or are explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call this
    destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process is designed to be thread-safe in the context of TrinityCore's AI subsystem,
    but care must be taken when accessing shared AI data structures from multiple
    threads.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke the destructor on stack-allocated objects as it
    will lead to undefined behavior. When using dynamic allocation, ensure that all
    pointers to AIDecisionTimer are properly deleted to prevent memory leaks. Avoid
    calling this destructor in scenarios where the timer might be accessed by other
    threads after destruction.
