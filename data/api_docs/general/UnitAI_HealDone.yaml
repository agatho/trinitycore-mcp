  class: UnitAI
  method: HealDone
  signature: void UnitAI::HealDone(Unit * param0, uint32 & param1)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a unit performs a heal action on another unit, updating
    relevant AI state or triggering associated behavior.
  description: The HealDone method is an event handler within the UnitAI class that
    is invoked when a unit successfully executes a healing action. This method typically
    updates internal AI state to reflect the completion of a heal, potentially affecting
    decision-making logic, cooldown tracking, or interaction with other AI systems.
    It may be used in conjunction with other AI events to maintain consistency in
    unit behavior during combat or non-combat scenarios. The method is part of the
    broader AI framework that governs how units interact with each other and respond
    to various game events.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the target Unit that received the heal. This parameter
      represents the unit on which the healing effect was applied.
  - name: param1
    description: Reference to a uint32 value representing the amount of healing done.
      This can be used to pass or modify healing values during the event processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic HealDone Usage
    code: "void MyAI::HealDone(Unit* target, uint32& healAmount)\n{\n    // Log the\
      \ healing event\n    sLog->outString(\"Unit healed %s for %u health.\", target->GetName(),\
      \ healAmount);\n    \n    // Update AI state or trigger other behavior\n   \
      \ m_lastHealTime = getMSTime();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core healing logic of the
    game engine when a heal is successfully applied. It's important to ensure that
    any modifications to the healAmount parameter do not cause unexpected behavior
    in the healing system or affect other systems relying on accurate healing values.
  warnings: Modifying the healAmount parameter may have unintended consequences if
    other systems depend on the original value. Ensure proper handling of this reference
    to avoid breaking healing mechanics or AI logic that relies on accurate healing
    data.
