  method: ResetMetrics
  signature: void ObstacleAvoidanceManager::ResetMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Resets all obstacle avoidance metrics to their default state.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and reinitializes all internal performance
    and tracking data used by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager. This includes clearing
    statistics such as collision counts, pathfinding attempts, and timing measurements.
    The method is typically invoked when resetting AI behavior or during system initialization
    to ensure accurate metric reporting. It does not affect the active obstacle avoidance
    algorithms or their current state, only the accumulated metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObstacleAvoidanceManager* manager = ...;

      manager->ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may reset internal counters that are used for debugging or optimization purposes.
    It is generally safe to call during AI initialization or when resetting a creature's
    behavior.
