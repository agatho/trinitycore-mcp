documentation:
  brief: Compares two FollowMovementParams objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a component-wise comparison between
    this FollowMovementParams instance and another FollowMovementParams object. It
    returns true if all corresponding members of both objects are equal, and false
    otherwise. This comparison is typically used in AI pathfinding and movement logic
    within the TrinityCore framework to determine if two movement parameters represent
    the same follow behavior configuration. The method does not consider any dynamic
    state or runtime conditions, focusing purely on the static parameter values.
  parameters:
  - name: other
    description: The FollowMovementParams object to compare against this instance.
  returns: True if all members of both FollowMovementParams objects are equal; false
    otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two FollowMovementParams instances
    code: 'FollowMovementParams params1;

      FollowMovementParams params2;

      bool areEqual = (params1 == params2); // Returns true if all members match'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in AI movement decision making
    code: "class MovementAI {\n    FollowMovementParams currentParams;\n    FollowMovementParams\
      \ targetParams;\n    \n    void Update() {\n        if (currentParams == targetParams)\
      \ {\n            // Movement parameters are identical, continue with current\
      \ behavior\n            return;\n        }\n        // Parameters differ, update\
      \ movement logic accordingly\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically implemented using member-wise comparison. The
    performance of this operation depends on the number of members in FollowMovementParams,
    but since it's a simple struct-like class, the comparison should be very fast.
    This method is commonly used in container comparisons and AI decision trees where
    movement parameters need to be checked for equivalence.
