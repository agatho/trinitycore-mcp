documentation:
  brief: Classifies a database statement by its type based on the provided statement
    identifier.
  description: The ClassifyStatement method determines the type of a database statement
    using its unique identifier. This functionality is typically used within TrinityCore's
    database handling system to route statements appropriately, such as distinguishing
    between prepared statements, simple queries, or stored procedures. The method
    performs a lookup in an internal classification map and returns the corresponding
    StatementType enum value. It assumes that the statementId has been validated and
    corresponds to an existing statement within the system.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns a StatementType enum value indicating the type of the classified
    statement. Possible values may include, but are not limited to: STATEMENT_TYPE_PREPARED,
    STATEMENT_TYPE_QUERY, or STATEMENT_TYPE_PROCEDURE depending on how the internal
    classification is implemented.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "StatementType type = classifier.ClassifyStatement(12345);\nif (type ==\
      \ STATEMENT_TYPE_PREPARED) {\n    // Handle prepared statement\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger database abstraction layer and relies
    on internal state management. It should only be called with valid statement identifiers
    that have been registered in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unregistered statementId may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect classification results. Ensure all statement
    IDs are properly initialized before calling this function.
