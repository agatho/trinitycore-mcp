  brief: Summons a Vilefiend pet for the demonology warlock
  description: The SummonVilefiend method creates and spawns a Vilefiend pet associated
    with the demonology warlock. This method is typically invoked when the player
    activates the Vilefiend summoning ability, which is part of the demonology specialization's
    core gameplay mechanics. The summoned pet will follow the warlock's commands and
    assist in combat. This method handles the creation of the pet entity, its initial
    positioning relative to the warlock, and integration into the warlock's pet management
    system. The method does not require any parameters as it uses the current state
    and configuration of the demonology warlock to determine how and where to summon
    the Vilefiend.

  - title: Basic Vilefiend Summoning
    code: 'DemonologyDemonTracker* tracker = player->GetDemonologyDemonTracker();

      tracker->SummonVilefiend();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the demonology warlock's spell
    activation sequence. The summoned Vilefiend will automatically follow the warlock
    and engage enemies within range. This method does not directly handle pet AI or
    combat behavior, which are managed separately by the game's core systems.
