  class: SmartAIMgr
  method: IsTextEmoteValid
  signature: bool SmartAIMgr::IsTextEmoteValid(const SmartScriptHolder & e, uint32
    entry)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a text emote in a SmartScriptHolder is correctly configured
    for use with the specified entry.
  description: The IsTextEmoteValid method checks if a given SmartScriptHolder's text
    emote action is valid and properly configured for use within the TrinityCore AI
    system. It evaluates the emote parameters against internal validation rules to
    ensure that the emote will execute correctly when triggered by the AI script.
    This method is typically used during script loading or validation phases to prevent
    invalid emotes from being executed in-game. The validation includes checking for
    valid emote IDs, proper target specifications, and ensuring that the emote action
    is compatible with the entry type it's associated with.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: A const reference to a SmartScriptHolder structure containing the
      AI script data including the text emote action to be validated.
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier of the creature or game object entry that this
      script is associated with, used to validate context-specific emote compatibility.
  returns: Returns true if the text emote in the SmartScriptHolder is valid and properly
    configured for the given entry; otherwise returns false if validation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Validation Usage
    code: "SmartScriptHolder script;\n// ... populate script with emote data ...\n\
      uint32 creatureEntry = 12345;\nbool isValid = sSmartAIMgr->IsTextEmoteValid(script,\
      \ creatureEntry);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with script execution\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs internal validation checks that may include verifying
    emote ID ranges, checking target types against allowed values for the given entry
    type, and ensuring proper parameter combinations. The validation is crucial for
    preventing runtime errors in AI scripts.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method to validate user input directly from external
    sources without additional sanitization, as it assumes valid SmartScriptHolder
    structures. Invalid or malformed script data may lead to unexpected behavior.
