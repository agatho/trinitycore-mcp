documentation:
  brief: Checks if all world objects in range satisfy a condition and returns true
    if so.
  description: The AllWorldObjectsInRange::operator() method is used to evaluate whether
    all world objects within a specified range meet a certain condition. This method
    is typically part of a predicate functor or lambda expression that iterates through
    nearby game objects such as players, creatures, or game objects. It returns true
    if every object in the range satisfies the condition, and false otherwise. The
    method is commonly used in AI logic, area-of-effect spell handling, or proximity-based
    triggers where it's necessary to confirm that all entities within a radius meet
    specific criteria before proceeding with an action.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all world objects in range satisfy the condition; otherwise
    returns false. If no objects are found in range, it may return true depending
    on implementation details, but typically this case is handled by the calling code
    or the underlying range-checking logic.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if All Nearby Players Are Hostile
    code: "class IsAllHostile {\npublic:\n    bool operator()(int* go) const {\n \
      \       // Assume go is a pointer to a GameObject or Unit\n        return (*go)->IsHostileTo(player);\n\
      \    }\n};\n\n// Usage\nAllWorldObjectsInRange checker;\nbool allHostile = checker(IsAllHostile());"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with range-based iterators or spatial
    indexing systems in TrinityCore. It's important to note that the actual behavior
    depends on how the functor passed into the operator() is implemented and what
    objects are considered within the range.
  warnings: Ensure that the condition checked by the functor does not cause side effects
    or infinite loops, especially when dealing with dynamic object lists. Also, be
    cautious about performance implications if large numbers of objects are in range,
    as this check could become expensive.
