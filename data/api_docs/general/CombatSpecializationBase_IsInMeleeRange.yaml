  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::IsInMeleeRange(::Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is within melee attack range of the specified
    target.
  description: The IsInMeleeRange method evaluates if the calling Unit instance can
    perform a melee attack on the provided target Unit. It considers the combat mechanics
    of World of Warcraft, including the base melee range, any applicable modifiers,
    and the positioning of both units. This method is commonly used in AI logic to
    decide whether a unit should engage in melee combat or move closer to its target.
    The result is true if the target is within the valid melee range, false otherwise.
    It does not account for line of sight or other environmental factors beyond basic
    distance.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object that represents the target against which
      to check melee range. Must be a valid Unit instance; passing nullptr may result
      in undefined behavior or an assertion failure.
  returns: Returns true if the calling unit is within melee attack range of the target,
    false otherwise. The exact calculation includes base melee range and any applicable
    modifiers such as weapon range or spell effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (me->IsInMeleeRange(target)) {\n    me->Attack(target, true);\n} else\
      \ {\n    me->MoveTowards(target, 0.5f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking range before casting a melee ability
    code: "if (me->IsInMeleeRange(victim)) {\n    me->CastSpell(victim, SPELL_MELEE_STRIKE,\
      \ true);\n} else {\n    me->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal combat range calculations that may be influenced
    by buffs, debuffs, or special abilities. It is recommended to validate the target
    pointer before calling this method to prevent potential crashes. The method does
    not consider movement speed or dynamic positioning changes during combat.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the target parameter will likely lead to a crash
    or undefined behavior. Always ensure that the target unit is valid and alive before
    invoking this method.
