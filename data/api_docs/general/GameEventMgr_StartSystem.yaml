  class: GameEventMgr
  method: StartSystem
  signature: uint32 GameEventMgr::StartSystem()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and starts the game event system, returning the number of active
    events.
  description: The StartSystem method initializes the GameEventMgr's internal state
    and begins processing active game events. It typically runs during server startup
    or when the event system needs to be reinitialized. This method ensures that all
    registered game events are properly scheduled and managed by the system. The return
    value indicates how many events were successfully started or are currently active.
    This method is crucial for maintaining proper event timing and execution within
    the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the count of game events that were successfully
    started or are currently active. A return value of 0 indicates no events were
    started, while any positive number indicates the number of active events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 activeEvents = sGameEventMgr->StartSystem();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Started %u game events", activeEvents);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically only be called once during server initialization.
    It's important to note that calling StartSystem multiple times may lead to duplicate
    event scheduling or unexpected behavior. The method internally handles synchronization
    and thread safety for event management.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method repeatedly in rapid succession as it may cause
    race conditions or duplicate event registrations. This method should not be called
    from within event handlers to prevent potential deadlocks or inconsistent state.
