documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG (Looking for Group) status update to the player's client
  description: The SendLfgUpdateStatus method is responsible for transmitting the
    current Looking for Group (LFG) status information to the player's client. This
    method is typically invoked when there are changes to the player's LFG queue state,
    such as when joining or leaving a group, or when the group's status updates. The
    updateData parameter contains all relevant information about the LFG status, including
    the type of update, current queue status, and any associated group data. This
    method ensures that the client's UI accurately reflects the player's current LFG
    state and helps maintain synchronization between server-side LFG management and
    the player's user interface.
  parameters:
  - name: updateData
    description: Contains the LFG update information including queue status, group
      details, and update type. This structure holds all relevant data needed to inform
      the client about changes in the LFG state.
  - name: party
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the update relates to a party context.
      When true, the update is formatted for party-related LFG information; when false,
      it's formatted for individual player LFG status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending LFG Update for Player
    code: 'lfg::LfgUpdateData updateData;

      updateData.type = lfg::LFG_UPDATETYPE_JOIN;

      updateData.status = lfg::LFG_STATUS_WAITING;

      SendLfgUpdateStatus(updateData, false);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending LFG Update for Party
    code: 'lfg::LfgUpdateData updateData;

      updateData.type = lfg::LFG_UPDATETYPE_LEAVE;

      updateData.status = lfg::LFG_STATUS_NONE;

      SendLfgUpdateStatus(updateData, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the client's network layer to send LFG
    status updates. It should only be called when there are actual changes to the
    player's LFG state to avoid unnecessary network traffic. The method assumes that
    updateData is properly initialized before being passed to it.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the updateData structure
    may result in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Always ensure that the
    LFG update data is valid and consistent with the current game state before sending
    updates.
