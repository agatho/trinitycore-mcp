  class: AuraEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & AuraEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the statistical metrics of the AuraEventBus instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a constant reference to the internal
    Statistics object that holds various performance and usage metrics for the AuraEventBus.
    This includes data such as the number of active auras, events processed, and other
    relevant operational statistics. The returned Statistics object is read-only and
    provides insight into how the aura event system is performing within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is typically used for monitoring, debugging, or performance
    analysis purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the Statistics object containing metrics about
    the AuraEventBus operations, including counts of processed events, active auras,
    and other relevant performance data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'const auto& stats = auraEventBus.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Active Auras: " << stats.activeAuras << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is immutable and should not be modified directly.
    Accessing this method does not incur significant performance overhead as it simply
    returns a reference to an already computed internal structure.
