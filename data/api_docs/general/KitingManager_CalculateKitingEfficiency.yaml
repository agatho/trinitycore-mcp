  class: KitingManager
  method: CalculateKitingEfficiency
  signature: float KitingManager::CalculateKitingEfficiency(Unit * target, KitingType
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the efficiency of kiting behavior for a given target unit and
    kiting type.
  description: The CalculateKitingEfficiency method evaluates how effectively a Unit
    performs kiting mechanics against a specified target. Kiting refers to the tactic
    of maintaining distance while attacking, typically used by ranged classes or pets.
    This method considers factors such as movement speed, attack timing, and positioning
    relative to the target to determine an efficiency score between 0.0 (inefficient)
    and 1.0 (optimal). The result can be used for AI decision-making, performance
    analysis, or balancing gameplay elements. The method requires a valid target Unit
    and a defined KitingType to compute its value.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that serves as the kiting target. Must
      be a valid Unit instance; null pointers will cause undefined behavior or crashes.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of kiting behavior to evaluate.
      Valid values are typically defined in the KitingType enum, such as KITING_TYPE_MELEE,
      KITING_TYPE_RANGED, etc.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated kiting efficiency. Values range
    from 0.0 (completely inefficient kiting) to 1.0 (perfectly efficient kiting).
    Returns 0.0 if invalid inputs are provided or if the calculation cannot be performed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CalculateKitingEfficiency
    code: "float efficiency = kitingManager->CalculateKitingEfficiency(playerTarget,\
      \ KITING_TYPE_RANGED);\nif (efficiency > 0.7f) {\n    // Perform advanced kiting\
      \ strategy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using kiting efficiency for AI decision making
    code: "Unit* target = ai->GetTarget();\nKitingType type = KITING_TYPE_MELEE;\n\
      float efficiency = kitingManager->CalculateKitingEfficiency(target, type);\n\
      if (efficiency < 0.5f) {\n    // Switch to a different combat tactic\n    ai->SetCombatStrategy(COMBAT_STRATEGY_FLEE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely involves complex calculations including distance metrics,
    movement velocity, attack cooldowns, and target positioning. It may be computationally
    expensive in high-frequency scenarios. The implementation might cache certain
    values for performance optimization.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for 'target' will lead to undefined behavior or
    crash the application. Ensure that the Unit object is valid and alive before calling
    this method. Also, make sure the KitingType enum value is valid to prevent incorrect
    calculations.
