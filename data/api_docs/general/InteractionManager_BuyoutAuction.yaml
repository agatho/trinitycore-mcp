  class: InteractionManager
  method: BuyoutAuction
  signature: bool InteractionManager::BuyoutAuction(Player * bot, Creature * auctioneer,
    uint32 auctionId)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to buy out an auction item through the specified auctioneer.
  description: The BuyoutAuction method facilitates the immediate purchase of an auctioned
    item by paying the full buyout price. It interacts with the auction system to
    process the transaction, ensuring that the bot player has sufficient funds and
    that the auction is valid. This method handles the necessary checks such as item
    availability, player gold balance, and auction expiration status before completing
    the purchase.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot attempting to buy
      out the auction.
  - name: auctioneer
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the NPC auctioneer handling
      the transaction.
  - name: auctionId
    description: Unique identifier of the auction to be purchased. Must correspond
      to a valid active auction.
  returns: Returns true if the auction was successfully bought out, false otherwise.
    Failure may occur due to insufficient funds, invalid auction ID, or expired auction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic BuyoutAuction Usage
    code: "if (interactionManager->BuyoutAuction(bot, auctioneer, 12345)) {\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      auction\", \"Successfully bought out auction ID 12345\");\n} else {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      auction\", \"Failed to buy out auction ID 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has already verified the auction's validity
    and that the player has sufficient gold. The method internally handles communication
    with the auction house database and updates the item ownership accordingly.
  warnings: Ensure that the auction ID is valid and not expired before calling this
    method, as invalid IDs may cause undefined behavior or silent failures. Also,
    verify that the bot's gold balance can cover the buyout price to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
