  signature: void QuestMenu::~QuestMenu()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestMenu object and releases all associated resources.
  description: The QuestMenu destructor is responsible for cleaning up all memory
    and resources allocated to a QuestMenu instance. This includes releasing any dynamically
    allocated data structures, clearing internal lists of available quests, and ensuring
    that no dangling pointers or memory leaks occur when the object goes out of scope.
    In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor ensures
    proper cleanup of quest-related UI state when a player closes their quest menu
    or when the menu is otherwise destroyed. The method is automatically invoked by
    the C++ runtime when the QuestMenu object is deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of QuestMenu
    code: "void HandlePlayerQuestMenu()\n{\n    QuestMenu menu;\n    // ... populate\
      \ menu with quests ...\n    // menu is automatically destroyed here when it\
      \ goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor does not need to be called manually in normal operation as
    it's invoked automatically by the C++ runtime during object destruction. Developers
    should ensure that no references to the QuestMenu remain after its destruction
    to prevent undefined behavior.
