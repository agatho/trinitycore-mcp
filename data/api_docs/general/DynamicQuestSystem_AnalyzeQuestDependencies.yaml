  method: AnalyzeQuestDependencies
  signature: void DynamicQuestSystem::AnalyzeQuestDependencies()
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes quest dependencies within the dynamic quest system to determine
    prerequisite and follow-up relationships.
  description: The AnalyzeQuestDependencies method scans all active quests in the
    dynamic quest system to identify and establish dependency relationships between
    quests. This includes determining which quests must be completed before others
    can be started, as well as identifying quests that become available only after
    specific conditions are met. The method processes quest data from the database
    and updates internal tracking structures to ensure proper quest progression logic
    is maintained. It is typically invoked during system initialization or when new
    quests are added to the dynamic system to maintain consistency in quest availability
    and completion requirements.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DynamicQuestSystem questSystem;

      questSystem.AnalyzeQuestDependencies();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after all quests have been loaded into the system
    but before any player interactions occur. The analysis process may involve database
    queries and can impact performance during system initialization. The method assumes
    that quest data is already populated in the system's internal structures.
  warnings: Calling this method repeatedly without proper state management may cause
    duplicate dependency tracking or inconsistent quest availability states. Ensure
    that no active quests are being modified during the analysis phase to prevent
    race conditions.
