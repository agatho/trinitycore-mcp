  class: CombatStrategy
  method: GetRelevance
  signature: float CombatStrategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the relevance score of a combat strategy for a given
    bot AI instance.
  description: The GetRelevance method calculates and returns a float value representing
    how relevant or applicable the current combat strategy is to the specified bot
    AI context. This score is typically used by the AI system to determine which strategy
    should be prioritized or executed in a given combat scenario. The relevance score
    can influence decision-making processes within the bot's tactical behavior, with
    higher scores indicating greater suitability for the current situation. The method
    takes into account various factors such as player health, enemy proximity, available
    resources, and other contextual elements that affect combat effectiveness.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the relevance of this combat
    strategy to the given AI context. A score of 0.0 indicates the strategy is not
    relevant at all, while a score of 1.0 indicates maximum relevance. Values in between
    represent varying degrees of applicability.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float relevance = strategy.GetRelevance(botAI);\nif (relevance > 0.7f)\
      \ {\n    // Execute this combat strategy\n    botAI->ExecuteStrategy(strategy);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Strategy Selection Based on Relevance
    code: "CombatStrategy* bestStrategy = nullptr;\nfloat bestRelevance = 0.0f;\n\n\
      for (auto& strategy : availableStrategies) {\n    float relevance = strategy.GetRelevance(botAI);\n\
      \    if (relevance > bestRelevance) {\n        bestRelevance = relevance;\n\
      \        bestStrategy = &strategy;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestStrategy && bestRelevance\
      \ > 0.3f) {\n    botAI->ExecuteStrategy(*bestStrategy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during combat decision-making
    loops, so performance is important. The relevance calculation may involve multiple
    checks and computations that depend on the specific implementation of the CombatStrategy
    subclass. The returned value should be treated as a relative measure for comparison
    purposes rather than an absolute metric.
  warnings: The method assumes that the provided BotAI pointer is valid and properly
    initialized. Calling this method with a null or invalid AI pointer may lead to
    undefined behavior. Additionally, the relevance score is context-dependent and
    may change rapidly during active combat situations, so caching results should
    be done carefully.
