  class: AuraEventBus
  method: ProcessEvents
  signature: uint32 AuraEventBus::ProcessEvents(uint32 diff, uint32 maxEvents)
documentation:
  brief: Processes pending aura events up to a specified maximum count.
  description: The ProcessEvents method iterates through queued aura events and executes
    them based on their triggers and timing. It is typically called during the game
    loop to handle time-based effects, periodic damage over time (DoT), healing over
    time (HoT), and other aura-related actions that occur at specific intervals. The
    method ensures that aura effects are properly updated and applied to affected
    units. It returns the number of events processed during this execution cycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: The number of aura events successfully processed during this call. Returns
    zero if no events were pending or if all events were skipped due to conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    uint32 diff = getMSTime();\n    auraEventBus.ProcessEvents(diff,\
      \ 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing events with event limit
    code: "uint32 processedCount = auraEventBus.ProcessEvents(50, 50);\nif (processedCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Log or handle the processed events\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Processed %u aura events\", processedCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked from within the core game update loop. It's
    important to note that event processing may be throttled or limited by maxEvents
    parameter to prevent performance degradation during high-load scenarios.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless you understand its internal workings
    and dependencies on the aura system. Improper usage can lead to unexpected behavior
    in active auras, including missed triggers or incorrect application of effects.
