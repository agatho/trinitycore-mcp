  method: IsSpawnedOnTransport
  signature: bool Creature::IsSpawnedOnTransport() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the creature is spawned on a transport, such as a boat
    or zeppelin.
  description: The IsSpawnedOnTransport method checks if the creature has been spawned
    onto a transport object, like a ship or flying machine. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft to manage creatures that are part of dynamic environments,
    such as those found on transports that move through the world. When a creature
    is spawned on a transport, its position and movement are tied to the transport's
    movement. This method returns true if the creature is currently associated with
    a transport, and false otherwise. It is typically used for logic involving transport-specific
    behavior, such as preventing certain AI actions or ensuring proper positioning
    during transport movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is spawned on a transport; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Creature is on Transport
    code: "if (creature->IsSpawnedOnTransport())\n{\n    // Handle logic specific\
      \ to creatures on transports\n    sLog->outString(\"Creature is spawned on a\
      \ transport.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AI Behavior Based on Transport Status
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsSpawnedOnTransport())\n\
      \    {\n        // Disable certain AI behaviors while on transport\n       \
      \ return;\n    }\n    // Normal AI behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal transport tracking within the TrinityCore
    framework. It is important to note that creatures spawned on transports may not
    be fully functional in all contexts, especially when it comes to combat or quest-related
    interactions. The method is lightweight and safe for frequent calls.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with movement or positioning
    logic, as creatures on transports might behave differently than those in static
    environments. Also, ensure that any AI behavior changes based on this flag are
    properly tested to avoid unexpected behavior during transport movement.
