  class: TransportAnimation
  method: GetPrevAnimNode
  signature: const TransportAnimationEntry * TransportAnimation::GetPrevAnimNode(int
    time) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the previous animation node in the transport animation sequence
    based on the provided time value.
  description: The GetPrevAnimNode method is used to find and return the animation
    node that precedes a given point in time within a transport's animation sequence.
    This method is typically utilized in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server to manage and synchronize the movement of transports such as boats, zeppelins,
    or other moving objects. It allows for precise control over the animation state
    at any given moment during a transport's journey. The method operates by searching
    through the internal animation entries of the transport and determining which
    node would have been active just before the specified time value. This is essential
    for maintaining accurate positioning and animation states during transport movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a TransportAnimationEntry object representing the previous
    animation node in the sequence, or nullptr if no valid previous node exists for
    the given time value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GetPrevAnimNode
    code: "const TransportAnimationEntry* prevNode = transport->GetPrevAnimNode(500);\n\
      if (prevNode)\n{\n    // Use the previous animation node\n    printf(\"Previous\
      \ node ID: %u\\n\", prevNode->ID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the transport's animation data is properly initialized
    and that the time parameter is within a valid range. The method may return nullptr
    if the time value is less than the earliest animation node or if no previous node
    exists in the sequence.
  warnings: Ensure that the transport object is valid and has loaded its animation
    data before calling this method. Calling this method on an uninitialized or improperly
    configured transport may result in undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences.
