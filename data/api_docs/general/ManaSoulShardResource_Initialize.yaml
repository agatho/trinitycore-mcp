  class: ManaSoulShardResource
  method: Initialize
  signature: void ManaSoulShardResource::Initialize(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the mana soul shard resource for a player bot, setting up internal
    tracking and state management.
  description: The Initialize method prepares a ManaSoulShardResource object for use
    with a specific player bot by establishing initial resource values, configuring
    internal state variables, and ensuring proper integration with the player's resource
    management system. This method is typically called during bot creation or initialization
    phases to ensure that the mana soul shard tracking functionality is properly set
    up before any resource operations occur. The method performs necessary setup without
    requiring additional parameters, relying on the provided Player pointer to configure
    all relevant internal properties.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      mana soul shards. Must be a valid player instance with proper initialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Example
    code: 'ManaSoulShardResource resource;

      Player* bot = ...; // Valid player pointer

      resource.Initialize(bot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization in Bot Creation Context
    code: "class BotAI {\npublic:\n    void InitializeBot(Player* bot) {\n       \
      \ manaSoulShardResource.Initialize(bot);\n        // Additional bot initialization\
      \ code\n    }\nprivate:\n    ManaSoulShardResource manaSoulShardResource;\n\
      };"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per resource instance. Repeated calls
    may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method assumes the Player
    pointer is valid and properly initialized, with all necessary player data structures
    already allocated.
  warnings: Passing a null or uninitialized Player pointer to this method will likely
    cause crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a
    fully constructed Player object before calling Initialize.
