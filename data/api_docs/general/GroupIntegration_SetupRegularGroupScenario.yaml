  method: SetupRegularGroupScenario
  signature: void GroupIntegration::SetupRegularGroupScenario(Group * group, RegularGroupScenario::Type
    type)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and configures a regular group scenario for the specified group.
  description: The SetupRegularGroupScenario method prepares a Group object for a
    standard group-based gameplay scenario. This includes setting up default group
    properties, initializing member tracking, configuring loot settings, and ensuring
    proper group synchronization with the game world. The method takes a pointer to
    a Group object and a scenario type enumeration that determines how the group should
    be configured. It is typically called when creating or resetting a group for activities
    such as dungeons, raids, or battlegrounds. The method ensures that all group members
    are properly initialized and that the group's state aligns with the specified
    scenario requirements.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object that will be configured for the regular
      group scenario. Must not be null.
  - name: type
    description: Enumeration value of type RegularGroupScenario::Type that specifies
      the scenario configuration to apply. Determines loot rules, group limits, and
      other scenario-specific behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Setup
    code: 'Group* myGroup = new Group();

      GroupIntegration::SetupRegularGroupScenario(myGroup, RegularGroupScenario::Type::DUNGEON);

      // Group is now configured for dungeon play'
    language: cpp
  - title: Raid Scenario Configuration
    code: "if (player->GetGroup())\n{\n    GroupIntegration::SetupRegularGroupScenario(player->GetGroup(),\
      \ RegularGroupScenario::Type::RAID);\n    // Group is now ready for raid participation\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided Group object has been properly constructed
    and initialized. It does not validate whether the group already contains members
    or has existing scenario configurations. The method may modify internal group
    state variables and should only be called when the group is in a consistent, ready-to-configure
    state.
  warnings: Calling this method on a null Group pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that the group object is valid and properly initialized before calling
    this method. Additionally, calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup
    may lead to inconsistent group states.
