  class: Map
  method: GetDifficultyID
  signature: Difficulty Map::GetDifficultyID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the difficulty identifier for the current map instance.
  description: The GetDifficultyID method retrieves the difficulty level associated
    with the current map instance. This value corresponds to the difficulty setting
    used in the game world, such as normal, heroic, or mythic modes. The method is
    commonly used in conjunction with other map-related functions to determine the
    appropriate gameplay mechanics and content for the current instance. It is particularly
    useful when checking whether a player is in a specific difficulty mode, such as
    heroic or mythic, which affects access to certain content and rewards.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the Difficulty enum value representing the current map's difficulty
    level. This value can be used to determine the appropriate game mechanics and
    content for the instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Difficulty diff = map->GetDifficultyID();\nif (diff == DIFFICULTY_NORMAL)\
      \ {\n    // Handle normal difficulty logic\n}\nelse if (diff == DIFFICULTY_HEROIC)\
      \ {\n    // Handle heroic difficulty logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to determine the appropriate difficulty level for a given instance. It should
    be noted that this method returns the difficulty level of the map itself, not
    necessarily the player's current difficulty level.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may return different values
    depending on the context in which it is called. The difficulty ID may change based
    on the instance's current state or player's progress.
