    that track guild activities within the World of Warcraft environment. The method

    guild events, including counts, types, and performance indicators for all events
    associated with the specified guild.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Guild Event Metrics
    code: "EventMetrics metrics = guildEventCoordinator->GetGuildEventMetrics(12345);\n\
      if (metrics.IsValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Total Events: \" << metrics.GetTotalEvents()\
      \ << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Completed Events: \" << metrics.GetCompletedEvents()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries to aggregate event data, so performance
    should be considered when calling it frequently. The returned EventMetrics object
    is typically populated with cached or pre-calculated values for efficiency.
  warnings: Ensure the guild ID provided is valid and corresponds to an existing guild
    in the database; otherwise, the behavior of this method is undefined and may result
    in invalid data or exceptions.
