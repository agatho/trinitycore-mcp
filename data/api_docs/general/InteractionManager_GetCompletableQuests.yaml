  signature: int InteractionManager::GetCompletableQuests(Player * bot, int * questGiver)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of quests available for completion from a quest giver.
  description: The GetCompletableQuests method determines how many quests are currently
    available for a player to complete from a specified quest giver. It evaluates
    the player's quest log and the state of the quest giver to identify which quests
    can be turned in. This method is commonly used in botting or AI systems to determine
    what actions a character should take next when interacting with NPCs. The method
    requires a valid Player object and an integer pointer that represents the quest
    giver's entry ID or GUID. It returns the number of completable quests, or zero
    if no quests are available for completion.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character interacting
      with the quest giver.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to an integer that holds the quest giver's entry ID or GUID.
      This value is used to identify which NPC to check for available quests.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of quests that are currently
    completable by the player from the specified quest giver. Returns zero if no quests
    are available for completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint questGiverEntry = 12345;\nint completableQuests\
      \ = sInteractionManager->GetCompletableQuests(player, &questGiverEntry);\nif\
      \ (completableQuests > 0)\n{\n    // Process the available quests\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Quest Availability Before Interaction
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nint questGiverEntry = 12345;\nint completableQuests\
      \ = sInteractionManager->GetCompletableQuests(player, &questGiverEntry);\nif\
      \ (completableQuests > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest completion logic\n \
      \   for (int i = 0; i < completableQuests; ++i)\n    {\n        // Handle each\
      \ quest\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No quests available, perhaps move to next\
      \ NPC\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interaction logic
    to automate quest completion for bots or AI-controlled characters. The quest giver's
    entry ID must be valid and correspond to an actual NPC in the game world. Performance-wise,
    this method may involve database queries or internal state checks, so it should
    not be called excessively in tight loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Also, verify that the questGiver parameter points to a valid quest giver
    entry ID; otherwise, the behavior of the method is undefined.
