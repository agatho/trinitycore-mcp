  class: DB2Manager

  signature: const ConditionalChrModelEntry * DB2Manager::GetConditionalChrModel(int32
    chrModelId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the conditional character model entry for a given character model
    ID.
  description: The GetConditionalChrModel method fetches a ConditionalChrModelEntry
    from the database based on the provided character model ID. This entry contains
    data related to conditional appearance changes for characters, such as when certain
    visual properties should be applied depending on game state or player conditions.
    The method is typically used during character rendering or appearance updates
    to determine how a character's model should be displayed under specific circumstances.
    It accesses internal DB2 storage and returns a pointer to the corresponding entry
    if found, or nullptr if no matching entry exists.
  parameters:
  - name: chrModelId
    description: The unique identifier of the character model for which to retrieve
      conditional appearance data. This ID corresponds to entries in the ChrModel.db2
      file and is used to match specific visual configurations.
  returns: A pointer to a ConditionalChrModelEntry structure containing conditional
    appearance data for the specified character model ID, or nullptr if no such entry
    exists in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Conditional Model Data
    code: "const ConditionalChrModelEntry* entry = sDB2Manager->GetConditionalChrModel(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    // Use the conditional model data\n    printf(\"Found conditional\
      \ model for ID %d\\n\", entry->ID);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No conditional\
      \ model found for ID 12345\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses DB2 files which are loaded at server startup. Ensure
    that the DB2 manager has been initialized before calling this method. The returned
    pointer is valid only as long as the DB2 data remains loaded and should not be
    stored for extended periods.
