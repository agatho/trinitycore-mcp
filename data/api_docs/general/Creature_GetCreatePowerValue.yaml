  method: GetCreatePowerValue
  signature: int32 Creature::GetCreatePowerValue(int power) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the base power value for a creature based on its creation parameters.
  description: The GetCreatePowerValue method retrieves the initial power value assigned
    to a creature at the time of its creation. This value is typically derived from
    the creature's entry in the database and represents the starting amount of power
    (such as mana, rage, or energy) that the creature possesses. The method accepts
    a power type identifier and returns the corresponding base power value configured
    for that creature type. This functionality is essential for ensuring creatures
    spawn with appropriate power levels consistent with their role in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 representing the base power value for the specified power
    type. A negative value may indicate an invalid or unsupported power type, while
    zero or positive values represent valid power amounts.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Base Mana Value
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      int32 baseMana = creature->GetCreatePowerValue(POWER_MANA);

      // Returns the initial mana value for this creature type'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check All Power Types
    code: "Creature* creature = ...;\nfor (int i = 0; i < MAX_POWERS; ++i)\n{\n  \
      \  int32 value = creature->GetCreatePowerValue(i);\n    if (value >= 0)\n  \
      \      printf(\"Power type %d: %d\\n\", i, value);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses creature data that is loaded from the database during
    server startup or creature spawning. The returned values are static and do not
    change during runtime unless the creature's entry is modified. Developers should
    be aware that this method may return zero for creatures that do not use a specific
    power type, which is valid behavior.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with invalid power type indices as
    it may return unexpected negative values. Ensure proper bounds checking if iterating
    through all possible power types to avoid misinterpreting negative return values
    as errors.
