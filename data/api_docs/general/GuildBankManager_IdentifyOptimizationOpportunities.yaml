  class: GuildBankManager
  method: IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities
  signature: void GuildBankManager::IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities(int * guild,
    BankAnalysis & analysis)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes guild bank contents to identify potential optimization opportunities
    for item management and storage.
  description: The IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities method evaluates the current
    state of a guild's bank inventory, examining item distribution, usage patterns,
    and storage efficiency. It processes the data through the provided BankAnalysis
    object to determine where improvements can be made in terms of space utilization,
    item categorization, and overall organization. This method is typically invoked
    during periodic maintenance or when significant changes occur in guild composition
    or activity levels. The analysis considers factors such as item rarity, usage
    frequency, and potential for consolidation or reorganization within the bank's
    layout.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      specifies which guild's bank data should be analyzed for optimization opportunities.
  - name: analysis
    description: Reference to a BankAnalysis object that will store the results of
      the optimization analysis. The method populates this structure with findings
      regarding potential improvements in guild bank organization and item management.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      BankAnalysis analysis;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities(&guildId, analysis);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing Analysis Results
    code: "int guildId = 12345;\nBankAnalysis analysis;\nGuildBankManager bankManager;\n\
      bankManager.IdentifyOptimizationOpportunities(&guildId, analysis);\n\n// Process\
      \ the optimization recommendations\nfor (const auto& recommendation : analysis.GetRecommendations())\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Optimization suggestion: %s\\n\", recommendation.c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called periodically as part of guild maintenance
    routines. It may perform intensive data processing on large guild bank inventories,
    so it should not be invoked synchronously during high-traffic periods. The BankAnalysis
    object must be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null pointer for the guild parameter will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure that the BankAnalysis object is valid and properly
    allocated before passing it to this method. This method does not modify the actual
    guild bank data; it only analyzes and reports potential optimizations.
