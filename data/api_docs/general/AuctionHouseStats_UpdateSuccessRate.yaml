documentation:
  brief: Updates the success rate statistics for auction house transactions
  description: The UpdateSuccessRate method recalculates and refreshes the success
    rate metrics for items sold through the auction house system. This method is typically
    invoked when auction house data needs to be refreshed or when new auction transactions
    have occurred. It updates internal tracking mechanisms that monitor how often
    auctions are successfully completed versus those that expire or fail. The implementation
    likely aggregates transaction data over a specified time window and computes statistical
    measures such as percentage success rates for different item categories or price
    ranges.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AuctionHouseStats stats;

      stats.UpdateSuccessRate();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called periodically by the auction house system to maintain
    accurate statistics. It's likely thread-safe as it operates on internal data structures
    that are designed for concurrent access. Performance impact should be minimal
    since it only updates statistical values rather than performing complex calculations.
