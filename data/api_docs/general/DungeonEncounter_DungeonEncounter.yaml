  class: DungeonEncounter
  method: DungeonEncounter
  signature: void DungeonEncounter::DungeonEncounter(uint32 id, const std::string
    & name, uint32 creatureId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a dungeon encounter with the specified ID, name, and creature
    identifier.
  description: The DungeonEncounter constructor initializes a new dungeon encounter
    object using the provided parameters. This method sets up the internal state of
    the encounter including its unique identifier, display name, and associated creature
    entry. The encounter is typically used within the context of dungeon mechanics
    in TrinityCore, where each boss or significant encounter in a dungeon is represented
    by an instance of this class. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input parameters and assumes valid values are provided.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: Unique identifier for the dungeon encounter. This value must be unique
      within the context of the dungeon and is used to reference this specific encounter
      throughout the game logic.
  - name: name
    description: Display name of the dungeon encounter. This string is used in UI
      elements, logs, and other interfaces to identify the encounter to players.
  - name: creatureId
    description: The creature entry ID that represents the boss or encounter in the
      game world. This ID corresponds to an entry in the creature_template table and
      determines the visual and behavioral characteristics of the encounter.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Encounter Initialization
    code: DungeonEncounter encounter(1234, "The Lich King", 36612);
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating a Custom Boss Encounter
    code: 'DungeonEncounter bossEncounter(5678, "Archimonde the Destroyer", 17968);

      // This would typically be used in a dungeon manager or encounter handler'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system for managing dungeon encounters
    and should be called during dungeon initialization or encounter setup. The class
    may require additional methods to properly register the encounter with the game's
    encounter system, such as adding it to a list of active encounters or linking
    it to specific dungeon instances.
  warnings: This constructor does not validate that the provided creatureId corresponds
    to an actual existing creature template in the database. Using invalid IDs may
    lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the encounter is activated.
    Ensure all parameters are valid before calling this method.
