documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the progress percentage of a specified quest for the player
  description: The GetQuestProgress method fetches the current progress of a specific
    quest in the player's quest log. It returns a boolean indicating whether the quest
    was found and successfully retrieved. The progress value represents how much of
    the quest has been completed, typically expressed as a percentage between 0.0
    and 100.0. This method is commonly used to determine the state of ongoing quests
    and to update UI elements such as quest tracking windows or progress bars. The
    method requires that the player has the quest in their log and that the quest
    data is properly initialized within the cache.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which to retrieve progress.
      Must be a valid quest ID present in the player's quest log.
  - name: progress
    description: Reference to a float variable where the progress percentage will
      be stored. On successful retrieval, this will contain a value between 0.0 (not
      started) and 100.0 (completed).
  returns: Returns true if the quest was found in the cache and progress data was
    successfully retrieved; otherwise returns false if the quest does not exist or
    is not tracked by the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check quest progress
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nfloat progress;\nif (questCache.GetQuestProgress(questId,\
      \ progress)) {\n    printf(\"Quest progress: %.2f%%\\n\", progress);\n} else\
      \ {\n    printf(\"Quest not found or not tracked\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using quest progress to update UI elements
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nfloat progress;\nif (questCache.GetQuestProgress(questId,\
      \ progress)) {\n    // Update progress bar in UI\n    ui->SetProgressBarValue(progress);\n\
      \    if (progress >= 100.0f) {\n        // Quest completed\n        ui->ShowCompletionMessage();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached quest data and may not reflect real-time changes
    from the database. The progress value is typically calculated based on objective
    completion counts rather than raw quest status. This method should only be called
    when the player has a valid session and the quest cache is properly initialized.
  warnings: Do not assume that a returned progress value of 100.0f indicates a completed
    quest in all cases; some quests may require additional steps like NPC interaction
    or item delivery. The progress value may also be interpolated between objective
    completions, so it might not always represent exact completion percentages.
