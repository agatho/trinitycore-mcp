api:
  class: Item
  method: GiveArtifactXp
  signature: void Item::GiveArtifactXp(uint64 amount, Item * sourceItem, uint32 artifactCategoryId)
documentation:
  brief: Grants artifact experience to the item's owner based on the specified amount
    and source item.
  description: The GiveArtifactXp method is used to award artifact experience points
    to the player who owns the item. This method typically occurs when an item, such
    as a weapon or trinket, is used or consumed in a way that contributes to artifact
    progression. The method takes into account the amount of experience to be granted,
    the source item that provided the XP, and the specific artifact category this
    XP should apply to. It ensures proper tracking and updating of artifact knowledge
    and progression for the player.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of artifact experience points to be awarded to the owner.
  - name: sourceItem
    description: Pointer to the item that is providing the artifact experience. This
      may influence how XP is applied or tracked.
  - name: artifactCategoryId
    description: The unique identifier of the artifact category this XP should be
      applied toward, determining which artifact progression system is affected.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Granting Artifact XP from a Weapon
    code: 'Item* weapon = player->GetItemByEntry(12345);

      Item* source = player->GetItemByEntry(67890);

      weapon->GiveArtifactXp(1000, source, 5);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during gameplay events such as combat or
    quest completion where artifact items contribute to character progression. It's
    important that the item calling this method has proper ownership and is associated
    with a valid player character.
  warnings: Ensure that the sourceItem pointer is valid and not null, otherwise behavior
    may be undefined. Also, the artifactCategoryId must correspond to an existing
    artifact category in the game database or the XP will not be applied correctly.
