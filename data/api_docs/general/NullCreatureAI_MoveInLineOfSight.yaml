  method: MoveInLineOfSight
  signature: void NullCreatureAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Processes line-of-sight events for a creature AI, triggering awareness behaviors
    when targets enter vision range.
  description: The MoveInLineOfSight method is a core component of the NullCreatureAI
    class that handles detection of nearby units entering the creature's line of sight.
    This method is typically invoked by the game engine when a unit moves within the
    creature's detection range, enabling the AI to respond with appropriate actions
    such as aggroing enemies or initiating combat behavior. The implementation is
    designed to be a no-op in the NullCreatureAI context, meaning it performs no actual
    AI logic but serves as a placeholder or base functionality for derived AI classes.
    This method plays a crucial role in the creature's awareness system and forms
    part of the broader event-driven AI architecture in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to an integer parameter that represents the target unit's
      identifier or related data. The exact meaning depends on the context in which
      this method is called, typically referencing a unit GUID or similar identification
      value.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI event handling
    code: "void NullCreatureAI::MoveInLineOfSight(int* targetGuid)\n{\n    // Base\
      \ implementation does nothing\n    // Derived classes would override this to\
      \ implement actual behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Override example for custom AI behavior
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public NullCreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void MoveInLineOfSight(int*\
      \ targetGuid) override\n    {\n        if (targetGuid && *targetGuid != 0)\n\
      \        {\n            // Custom logic: attack the target\n            AttackStart(*targetGuid);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's AI framework and is called automatically
    by the game engine during unit movement updates. It's important to note that in
    the base NullCreatureAI implementation, this method does not perform any meaningful
    actions. Developers should override this method in custom AI implementations to
    provide actual creature behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly unless implementing a custom AI class.
    The parameter is expected to be a pointer to an integer representing a unit identifier;
    passing invalid or null pointers may cause undefined behavior in derived implementations.
