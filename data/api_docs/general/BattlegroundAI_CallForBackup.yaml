api:
  class: BattlegroundAI
  method: CallForBackup
  signature: bool BattlegroundAI::CallForBackup(int * player, const int & location)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a backup call for players in a battleground, returning true if
    successful.
  description: The CallForBackup method is used within the BattlegroundAI class to
    request backup assistance from nearby players during battleground events. This
    method typically handles the logic for identifying eligible players within a specified
    location or area and initiating a backup call. The method takes a pointer to an
    integer representing the player and a constant reference to an integer indicating
    the location. It returns true if the backup call was successfully initiated, otherwise
    false. This functionality is crucial for maintaining balanced gameplay and ensuring
    that players can receive timely assistance during competitive battleground scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player who initiated the backup
      request. This value may be modified by the method to reflect the actual player
      receiving the backup call.
  - name: location
    description: Constant reference to an integer indicating the location or zone
      where the backup is needed. This typically represents a specific battleground
      coordinate or area identifier.
  returns: Returns true if the backup call was successfully processed and initiated
    for eligible players, otherwise returns false. The method may return false if
    no valid players are found within the specified location or if the request fails
    due to game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CallForBackup
    code: "BattlegroundAI* bgAI = ...;\nint playerID = 12345;\nint locationID = 67890;\n\
      bool result = bgAI->CallForBackup(&playerID, locationID);\nif (result)\n{\n\
      \    // Backup call was successful\n    printf(\"Backup call initiated for player\
      \ %d at location %d\\n\", playerID, locationID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the battleground AI system and should only be called
    during active battleground sessions. The implementation may involve checking player
    availability, distance, and team affiliation before processing backup requests.
    Developers should ensure that the player and location parameters are valid before
    calling this method to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of a proper battleground context may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. The method modifies the player parameter, so
    developers should be aware that the original value might be overwritten. Additionally,
    frequent calls to this method without proper cooldowns could impact performance.
