  class: InterruptAwareness
  method: ShouldScanUnit
  signature: bool InterruptAwareness::ShouldScanUnit(Unit * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a unit should be scanned for interrupt awareness conditions.
  description: The ShouldScanUnit method evaluates whether a given unit meets the
    criteria for being considered in interrupt awareness checks. This typically involves
    assessing if the unit is of a type that can be interrupted, such as players or
    certain NPC types, and whether it's within the scope of the current scanning context.
    The method is used by the interrupt awareness system to filter out irrelevant
    units during scan operations, improving performance and ensuring accurate detection
    of interruptible targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit should be included in interrupt awareness scans,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the unit is eligible for
    interrupt checks based on its type, state, and other relevant conditions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in interrupt awareness logic
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.ShouldScanUnit(targetUnit)) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ interrupt scan logic\n    // e.g., check if target is casting a spell that\
      \ can be interrupted\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI behavior
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\
      \ {\n            if (interruptAwareness.ShouldScanUnit(target)) {\n        \
      \        // Perform interrupt awareness actions\n                if (target->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\
      \ {\n                    // Attempt to interrupt the cast\n                }\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or when processing
    spell interrupts. It's important to note that the decision logic may depend on
    factors such as unit faction, current state (e.g., dead, stunned), and whether
    the unit is within the valid detection range of the interrupt awareness system.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on units that have been destroyed or
    are in an invalid state, as it may lead to undefined behavior. The method assumes
    proper initialization of the InterruptAwareness object and should only be used
    when the system is fully operational.
