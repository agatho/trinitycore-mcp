  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: ExecuteFallbackRotation
  signature: void DeathKnightAI::ExecuteFallbackRotation(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the fallback death knight AI rotation against the specified target.
  description: The ExecuteFallbackRotation method performs the default combat behavior
    for a Death Knight AI when no specific rotation or priority is defined. This function
    typically handles basic attack patterns, ability usage, and resource management
    according to standard death knight gameplay mechanics. It serves as a fallback
    mechanism when more complex rotation logic cannot be executed due to conditions
    such as lack of valid targets, insufficient resources, or AI state constraints.
    The method operates on the provided target unit and manages the AI's actions within
    the context of the current combat situation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the current target. Must
      be a valid unit pointer; null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Context
    code: "void MyDeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    if (target && target->IsAlive())\n\
      \    {\n        ExecuteFallbackRotation(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the AI system during combat updates when
    no higher-priority actions are available. It assumes that the AI has a valid target
    and that basic combat conditions are met. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific death knight class specialization and current game state.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring a valid target can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the target is alive and valid before invoking
    this function.
