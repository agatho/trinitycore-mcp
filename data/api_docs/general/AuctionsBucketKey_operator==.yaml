documentation:
  brief: Compares two AuctionsBucketKey objects for equality.
  description: The operator== method performs a lexicographical comparison between
    two AuctionsBucketKey instances to determine if they are identical. This comparison
    is typically used within the auction house system to check if two auction entries
    belong to the same bucket or share the same key characteristics. The method evaluates
    all relevant fields of the AuctionsBucketKey structure for equality and returns
    true only if all fields match exactly. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    data integrity in the auction house's internal data structures.
  parameters:
  - name: right
    description: The AuctionsBucketKey object to compare against the current instance
  returns: Returns true if both AuctionsBucketKey objects have identical field values,
    false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic equality check between two auction bucket keys
    code: 'AuctionsBucketKey key1;

      AuctionsBucketKey key2;

      bool areEqual = (key1 == key2); // Returns true if both keys have identical
      values'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using equality operator in auction house logic
    code: "AuctionsBucketKey currentKey = GetAuctionBucketKey(auction);\nAuctionsBucketKey\
      \ newKey = GenerateNewBucketKey(item);\nif (currentKey == newKey) {\n    //\
      \ Handle case where item belongs to same bucket\n    ProcessSameBucketAuction(auction);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where item belongs to different bucket\n    ProcessDifferentBucketAuction(auction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely compares internal fields such as item class, subclass,
    quality, and other relevant auction parameters. The implementation should be efficient
    since it's used frequently in auction house operations. This method is part of
    the standard comparison operators for the AuctionsBucketKey class and should be
    used consistently with other comparison operators (like !=, <, >) for proper sorting
    and hashing behavior.
