api:
  class: DruidAI
  method: HasEnoughResource
  signature: bool DruidAI::HasEnoughResource(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the Druid AI has sufficient resource requirements to cast a specified
    spell.
  description: The HasEnoughResource method evaluates whether the current Druid AI
    instance possesses adequate mana, rage, or energy resources to successfully cast
    the given spell. This method is typically used during AI decision-making processes
    to determine spell eligibility before attempting to cast. It considers the resource
    cost of the spell and compares it against the AI's current resource pool. The
    method returns true if sufficient resources are available, false otherwise. This
    functionality is crucial for proper spell selection and execution in Druid AI
    behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to check resource requirements
      for. This ID corresponds to entries in the spell database and determines the
      required resource cost.
  returns: Returns true if the Druid AI has enough resources (mana, rage, or energy)
    to cast the specified spell; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "if (druidAI->HasEnoughResource(5185)) {\n    // Cast Healing Touch\n  \
      \  druidAI->CastSpell(5185);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Resource Validation Before Spell Selection
    code: "uint32 spellToCast = 0;\nif (druidAI->HasEnoughResource(774)) {\n    spellToCast\
      \ = 774; // Rejuvenation\n} else if (druidAI->HasEnoughResource(5185)) {\n \
      \   spellToCast = 5185; // Healing Touch\n}\nif (spellToCast) {\n    druidAI->CastSpell(spellToCast);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's current resource tracking system
    and may consider spell-specific resource costs defined in the game's spell database.
    It is part of the core Druid AI logic for intelligent spell casting decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter corresponds to a valid spell entry in
    the database, as invalid IDs may lead to unexpected behavior or errors during
    resource evaluation.
