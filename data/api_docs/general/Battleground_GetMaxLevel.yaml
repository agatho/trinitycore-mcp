  class: Battleground
  method: GetMaxLevel
  signature: int Battleground::GetMaxLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum allowed level for players in the battleground.
  description: The GetMaxLevel method retrieves the highest player level that is permitted
    to join the battleground. This value is typically defined by the battleground's
    configuration and affects player eligibility during queueing and matchmaking.
    The returned level acts as an upper boundary for level-based restrictions within
    the context of the specific battleground instance. This method does not perform
    any dynamic calculations or checks; it simply returns a pre-defined maximum level
    value associated with the battleground.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum allowed player level for participation
    in this battleground. Players above this level will be unable to join the battleground.
  examples:
  - title: Check Maximum Level Before Joining
    code: "Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    int maxLevel = bg->GetMaxLevel();\n    printf(\"Maximum level for this\
      \ battleground: %d\\n\", maxLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used during battleground queue processing to validate
    player eligibility. The value returned may vary depending on the specific battleground
    type (e.g., Alterac Valley, Eye of the Storm) and its configuration settings.
