  signature: void TradeSystem::ProcessActiveTrades()
documentation:
  brief: Processes all active trades in the system, updating their states and completing
    valid transactions.
  description: The ProcessActiveTrades method iterates through all currently active
    trade sessions within the TrinityCore framework. It evaluates each trade's validity,
    checks for player agreement, and handles the transfer of items and currency between
    trading parties. This method ensures that trades are properly finalized or canceled
    based on game rules and player actions. The function typically runs as part of
    the game loop to maintain real-time trade processing and synchronization across
    the server.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other updates ...\n    tradeSystem.ProcessActiveTrades();\n\
      \    // ... more updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly in the game loop to ensure timely
    processing of trades. It may involve database operations for item transfers and
    player state updates, so performance considerations apply when handling many concurrent
    trades.
