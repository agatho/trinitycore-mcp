  signature: bool DeathRecoveryManager::ForceResurrection(ResurrectionMethod method)
documentation:
  brief: Forces a player to be resurrected using the specified resurrection method.
  description: The ForceResurrection method attempts to immediately resurrect a player
    character who is currently in a dead state. This method is typically used in scenarios
    where an administrator or game mechanic needs to bypass normal resurrection restrictions
    or delays. The method takes a ResurrectionMethod parameter that determines how
    the resurrection should be handled, such as using a soulstone, being resurrected
    at a graveyard, or other game-specific mechanics. It returns true if the resurrection
    was successfully initiated, and false otherwise. This function may not work in
    all situations, particularly when the player is in a state where resurrection
    is not allowed by game rules or server configuration.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the forced resurrection was successfully initiated for
    the player; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid state, permissions,
    or other constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Force Resurrection Usage
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager->ForceResurrection(RESURRECTION_METHOD_SOULSTONE))\
      \ {\n    // Resurrection initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ has been force resurrected using soulstone.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ initiate resurrection\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to force resurrection.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it bypasses normal game mechanics.
    It may not work if the player is in a restricted zone or under certain game states
    such as being in combat. The ResurrectionMethod parameter must be valid and supported
    by the server configuration.
  warnings: Using this method without proper checks can lead to unexpected behavior,
    especially in PvP zones or during important events where normal resurrection rules
    apply. It should only be used by trusted administrators or within controlled game
    mechanics.
