  class: Creature
  method: SetTextRepeatId
  signature: void Creature::SetTextRepeatId(uint8 textGroup, uint8 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the text repeat ID for a creature's dialogue.
  description: This method assigns a specific text repeat ID to a creature, which
    determines how many times the creature will repeat its dialogue text when interacting
    with players. The textGroup parameter specifies which group of text entries to
    use, while the id parameter defines the repeat count. This functionality is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework for managing NPC dialogue behavior
    and ensuring proper text repetition during quest interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: textGroup
    description: The text group identifier that specifies which set of text entries
      to use for repetition. Valid values are typically 0-255, with 0 being the default
      group.
  - name: id
    description: The repeat ID that determines how many times the creature's dialogue
      text will be repeated. This value should be between 0 and 255, where 0 means
      no repetition and higher values indicate more repetitions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetTextRepeatId(0, 2);

      // This sets the creature''s text repeat ID to 2 for group 0'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      uint8 textGroup = 1;

      uint8 id = 3;

      creature->SetTextRepeatId(textGroup, id);

      // This sets the creature''s text repeat ID to 3 for group 1, allowing for multiple
      repetitions of dialogue text'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature dialogue
    methods and should be called before the creature's dialogue is triggered. The
    implementation relies on the creature's database entry to determine how many times
    the text repeats, making it important for proper quest handling.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to incorrect dialogue repetition
    behavior or even crashes if values exceed valid ranges. Ensure that both parameters
    are within acceptable limits before calling this method.
