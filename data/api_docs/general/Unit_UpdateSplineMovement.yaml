documentation:
  brief: Updates the spline movement for a unit, handling path interpolation and movement
    updates.
  description: This method updates the spline movement for a Unit, which is used to
    manage the smooth movement of units along predefined paths. It handles the interpolation
    between waypoints and updates the movement state based on time differences. The
    method is crucial for maintaining realistic movement behavior in World of Warcraft
    environments, particularly for NPCs and creatures that follow complex paths. It
    ensures proper synchronization of movement with game time and provides accurate
    positioning updates.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->UpdateSplineMovement(100);

      // Updates spline movement with 100ms time diff'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main update loop and should be used
    in conjunction with other movement-related methods. Performance considerations
    include handling of large numbers of waypoints and smooth interpolation calculations.
  warnings: Care must be taken when calling this method in different threads, as it
    may cause race conditions if not properly synchronized. The method requires accurate
    time tracking to function correctly.
