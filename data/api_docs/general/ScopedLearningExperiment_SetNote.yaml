  signature: void ScopedLearningExperiment::SetNote(const std::string & note)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the note associated with the scoped learning experiment
  description: The SetNote method assigns a descriptive note to the ScopedLearningExperiment
    instance. This note can be used for logging, debugging, or identifying specific
    experiment instances within the game's learning systems. The method accepts a
    constant reference to a std::string which becomes the internal note of the experiment.
    No validation is performed on the input string, and it will overwrite any previously
    set note. This method is typically used during experiment initialization or configuration
    phases.
  parameters:
  - name: note
    description: A constant reference to a std::string containing the descriptive
      note to associate with this scoped learning experiment
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ScopedLearningExperiment experiment;

      experiment.SetNote("Player behavior analysis for quest completion");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Note Assignment
    code: 'std::string experimentName = "Combat AI Test " + std::to_string(GetTickCount());

      experiment.SetNote(experimentName);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The note is stored as a copy of the input string, so modifications to the
    original string after calling this method will not affect the experiment's note.
    This method is not thread-safe and should be called from a single thread or with
    appropriate synchronization if used in multi-threaded contexts.
