documentation:
  brief: Resets all movement arbiter statistics to their initial state.
  description: The Reset method clears and initializes all internal counters and tracking
    data within the MovementArbiterStatistics class. This method is typically invoked
    when a new movement arbitration session begins or when existing statistics need
    to be cleared for accurate measurement. It ensures that subsequent measurements
    start from a clean slate, preventing any carryover of previous session data that
    could skew performance metrics or tracking information.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new measurement cycle to ensure
    accurate tracking. It is not thread-safe and should only be invoked when no other
    threads are accessing the statistics object.
