  class: QuestEventBus
  method: GetPendingEventCount
  signature: uint32 QuestEventBus::GetPendingEventCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of pending quest events currently queued in the event
    bus.
  description: The GetPendingEventCount method retrieves the total count of quest-related
    events that are currently awaiting processing within the QuestEventBus. This count
    includes all events that have been submitted to the bus but not yet executed or
    dispatched. The method is useful for monitoring the workload of the quest event
    system, debugging event handling issues, or determining when to trigger certain
    game logic based on pending event volume. It provides a snapshot of the current
    state of the event queue without modifying any internal data structures.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of pending quest events in the event
    bus. Returns zero if no events are currently queued.
  examples:
  - title: Check Pending Quest Events
    code: "uint32 pendingCount = sQuestEventBus->GetPendingEventCount();\nif (pendingCount\
      \ > 10)\n{\n    // Log warning or take action if too many events are pending\n\
      \    TC_LOG_WARN(\"quest\", \"High number of pending quest events: %u\", pendingCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on the event queue and is generally
    safe to call from any thread context. The returned count reflects the state at
    the moment of the call, so it may change immediately after the method returns
    if other threads are adding or processing events.
