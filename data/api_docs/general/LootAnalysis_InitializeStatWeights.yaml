documentation:
  brief: Initializes stat weight configurations for loot analysis calculations
  description: The InitializeStatWeights method sets up internal data structures and
    configurations required for performing loot analysis based on character stats.
    This method typically loads or calculates stat weights that determine how different
    attributes (such as strength, agility, intellect) contribute to overall item value.
    It prepares the system for subsequent loot evaluation operations by establishing
    baseline weight values for various game statistics. The initialization process
    may involve reading from configuration files, database entries, or hardcoded defaults
    depending on the implementation.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'LootAnalysis lootAnalyzer;

      lootAnalyzer.InitializeStatWeights();

      // Stat weights are now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during system initialization
    or when stat configurations need to be refreshed. It may involve database queries
    or file I/O operations, so performance considerations apply in high-frequency
    scenarios.
