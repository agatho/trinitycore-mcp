  method: GetStacks
  signature: uint32 VoidformTracker::GetStacks() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current stack count of the Voidform buff.
  description: The GetStacks method returns the number of active stacks of the Voidform
    spell currently applied to the caster. This method is typically used in spell
    effect handlers or aura applications to determine the intensity or duration multiplier
    of void-based abilities. The returned value represents how many times the Voidform
    buff has been applied, which may affect damage output, mana costs, or other mechanics
    depending on the specific implementation within TrinityCore's spell system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current number of stacks of the Voidform
    buff. Returns 0 if no stacks are active.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Voidform Stacks Before Casting
    code: "void ApplyVoidBoltSpell(Unit* target)\n{\n    if (Player* player = player->ToPlayer())\n\
      \    {\n        if (Aura* voidform = player->GetAura(VOIDFORM_SPELL_ID))\n \
      \       {\n            uint32 stacks = voidform->GetStacks();\n            if\
      \ (stacks > 0)\n            {\n                // Apply increased damage based\
      \ on stack count\n                uint32 damage = baseDamage * (1 + (stacks\
      \ * 0.1f));\n                player->CastSpell(target, VOIDBOLT_SPELL_ID, true);\n\
      \            }\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the aura object is valid and has been properly initialized
    with stack information. It does not perform any validation or error handling on
    its own.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-zero return value means the spell is active;
    always verify the presence of the actual aura before using the stack count for
    calculations.
