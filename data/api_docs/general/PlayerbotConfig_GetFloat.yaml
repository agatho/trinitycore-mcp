documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a floating-point configuration value by key, returning a default
    if the key is not found.
  description: The GetFloat method retrieves a floating-point configuration value
    associated with the specified key from the player bot configuration. If the key
    does not exist in the configuration, it returns the provided default value instead.
    This method is commonly used to access numeric settings that control various aspects
    of bot behavior, such as movement thresholds, reaction speeds, or decision-making
    parameters. The configuration values are typically loaded at startup or runtime
    from configuration files and may be modified dynamically during gameplay. The
    method performs a lookup operation in an internal configuration map, making it
    efficient for frequent access patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: The string key used to identify the desired floating-point configuration
      value. This should match exactly with keys defined in the player bot configuration
      files or system.
  - name: defaultValue
    description: The default float value to return if the specified key is not found
      in the configuration. This ensures safe fallback behavior when configuration
      entries are missing.
  returns: A float value representing either the configured value for the given key
    or the provided default value if the key does not exist in the configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving a Movement Speed Threshold
    code: float speedThreshold = playerbotConfig.GetFloat("PlayerBot.MovementSpeedThreshold",
      2.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Default Value for Unknown Configuration Key
    code: 'float aggressionLevel = playerbotConfig.GetFloat("PlayerBot.AggressiveBehavior",
      0.5f);

      // Returns 0.5f if "PlayerBot.AggressiveBehavior" key is not defined in config'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses an internal configuration cache, so repeated calls with
    the same key are efficient. The configuration system supports hierarchical keys
    and can be extended with custom entries. Ensure that all configuration keys used
    are properly documented or defined in the relevant configuration files.
  warnings: Be cautious when using default values that might cause unexpected behavior
    if a configuration key is missing. Always validate critical configuration values
    to prevent runtime errors or unintended bot behavior.
