  brief: Sets the semaphore for teleporting the player to a far location.
  description: This method controls the teleportation semaphore state for a player,
    determining whether the player can be teleported to a distant location. It is
    typically used in conjunction with other teleportation mechanisms to manage player
    movement and prevent unintended teleportation events. The method affects the internal
    state of the player's teleportation system and may influence game mechanics related
    to player movement and positioning.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSemaphoreTeleportFar(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely affects internal teleportation flags and may be used in
    conjunction with other teleportation-related methods. Implementation details are
    not fully known, but it's likely part of a larger teleportation system.
