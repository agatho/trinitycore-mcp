  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: StartRealTimeMonitoring
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::StartRealTimeMonitoring()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates real-time monitoring of AI decision-making processes within the
    TrinityCore framework.
  description: 'The StartRealTimeMonitoring method activates the profiling mechanism
    for AI decisions, enabling detailed tracking and analysis of how NPCs make choices
    during gameplay. This functionality is primarily used for debugging, performance
    optimization, and understanding AI behavior in various scenarios. The method typically
    sets internal flags or starts timers that capture decision points, execution times,
    and other relevant metrics. It should be called before any AI decision-making
    occurs to ensure comprehensive data collection. Precondition: The AIDecisionProfiler
    instance must be properly initialized. Postcondition: Real-time monitoring begins
    immediately and continues until explicitly stopped via a corresponding stop method.'
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.StartRealTimeMonitoring();

      // AI decisions will now be monitored in real-time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may introduce performance overhead during active monitoring due
    to the additional profiling operations. It's recommended to use this only during
    development or debugging phases, not in production environments. The profiler
    likely uses high-resolution timers and may require specific permissions or configurations
    depending on the TrinityCore build settings.
  warnings: Calling StartRealTimeMonitoring multiple times without stopping previous
    monitoring sessions can lead to undefined behavior or data corruption. Ensure
    that each monitoring session is properly terminated using the corresponding stop
    method before initiating a new one.
