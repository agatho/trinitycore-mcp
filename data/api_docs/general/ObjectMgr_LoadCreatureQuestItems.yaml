documentation:
  brief: Loads quest item associations for creatures from the database into memory.
  description: The LoadCreatureQuestItems method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with quest item requirements associated with creatures in the
    World of Warcraft database. This method is typically called during server startup
    or database reload operations to ensure that creature quest item data is available
    for runtime checks. It reads from relevant database tables containing creature
    quest item mappings and caches this information for efficient lookup when players
    interact with quest-related creatures. The loaded data includes which items are
    required from specific creatures to complete certain quests, enabling proper quest
    progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld() {\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadCreatureQuestItems();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the ObjectMgr initialization sequence. It performs database queries to fetch
    creature quest item data and caches it in memory for fast access during gameplay.
    The method should only be called once per server lifecycle unless the underlying
    database content has changed and needs reloading.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. It's important to ensure that any existing
    cached data is properly cleared before reloading creature quest items.
