documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current death recovery state of the player
  description: The GetState method returns the current DeathRecoveryState enum value
    that represents the player's current state in the death recovery process. This
    state indicates whether the player is in a recoverable state, has completed recovery,
    or is in a transitional phase after death. The method provides access to the internal
    state management of the death recovery system without modifying it. This is typically
    used by game systems to determine appropriate actions during character death and
    resurrection sequences.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'DeathRecoveryState enum value representing the current state of the death
    recovery process. Possible values include but are not limited to: DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_NONE,
    DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_IN_PROGRESS, DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_COMPLETED, DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_FAILED.'
  examples:
  - title: Check player's death recovery state
    code: "void CheckDeathRecoveryState(Player* player)\n{\n    DeathRecoveryManager&\
      \ manager = player->GetDeathRecoveryManager();\n    DeathRecoveryState state\
      \ = manager.GetState();\n    \n    switch (state)\n    {\n        case DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_NONE:\n\
      \            // Player is not in death recovery\n            break;\n      \
      \  case DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_IN_PROGRESS:\n            // Player is currently\
      \ recovering from death\n            break;\n        case DEATH_RECOVERY_STATE_COMPLETED:\n\
      \            // Death recovery has completed\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            // Unknown state\n            break;\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method is read-only and does not modify any internal state. The returned
    value reflects the exact state at the time of the call, which may change immediately
    after the method returns due to game events or system updates.
