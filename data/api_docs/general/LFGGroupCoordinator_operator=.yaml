documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one LFGGroupCoordinator object to another
  description: The assignment operator for LFGGroupCoordinator performs a deep copy
    of all member variables from the source object to the target object. This method
    is used to replace the current state of an LFGGroupCoordinator instance with that
    of another. In the context of World of Warcraft's LFG (Looking for Group) system,
    this operation ensures that group coordination data such as player assignments,
    role information, and queue states are properly transferred between coordinator
    instances. The operator handles memory management internally to prevent resource
    leaks or double-free errors.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source LFGGroupCoordinator object whose contents will be copied
      to this instance
  returns: A reference to the current LFGGroupCoordinator object after the assignment
    has been completed, enabling chained assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Assignment Example
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator1;

      LFGGroupCoordinator coordinator2;

      coordinator2 = coordinator1; // Assigns contents of coordinator1 to coordinator2'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment Example
    code: 'LFGGroupCoordinator coordA, coordB, coordC;

      coordC = coordB = coordA; // Chained assignment

      // Both coordB and coordC now contain the same data as coordA'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator likely implements copy semantics that ensures all internal
    data structures are properly duplicated. Since LFGGroupCoordinator is part of
    TrinityCore's LFG system, it may involve complex state management including player
    roles, group composition, and queue status information.
  warnings: Be cautious when assigning large coordinator objects as this operation
    may be computationally expensive due to deep copying of internal data structures.
    Also, ensure that the source object remains valid during the assignment operation
    to avoid undefined behavior.
