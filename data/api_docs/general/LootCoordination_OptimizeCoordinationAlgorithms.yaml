documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the loot coordination algorithms used in group loot systems.
  description: The OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms method enhances the efficiency of
    loot distribution mechanisms within TrinityCore's loot coordination system. This
    method is typically invoked to improve performance and reduce latency during group
    loot scenarios, such as when multiple players are participating in a loot roll
    or when loot is being distributed among group members. It may adjust internal
    data structures, reorganize priority queues, or recalibrate decision-making logic
    to ensure optimal resource allocation and fairness in loot distribution. The method
    operates on the current state of the LootCoordination object and does not require
    external parameters.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LootCoordination coordination;

      coordination.OptimizeCoordinationAlgorithms();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called periodically or after significant changes in
    group composition to maintain optimal performance. It is recommended to avoid
    calling this method during active loot events to prevent potential conflicts with
    ongoing coordination processes.
