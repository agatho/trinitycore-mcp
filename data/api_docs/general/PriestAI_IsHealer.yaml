  class: PriestAI
  method: IsHealer
  signature: bool PriestAI::IsHealer(int * unit)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the priest AI instance is configured as a healer class.
  description: The IsHealer method checks if the current PriestAI instance represents
    a healing-oriented priest, typically used to differentiate between different priest
    specializations such as Discipline, Holy, or Shadow. This method evaluates internal
    state variables or configuration flags within the AI to determine its role. It
    is commonly used in behavior logic to conditionally execute healing spells or
    abilities based on the priest's assigned role.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the PriestAI instance is configured for healing duties,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (priestAI->IsHealer()) {\n    // Execute healing logic\n    DoHeal();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Casting
    code: "if (priestAI->IsHealer()) {\n    if (CanCastSpell(SPELL_FLASH_HEAL)) {\n\
      \        CastSpell(SPELL_FLASH_HEAL);\n    }\n} else {\n    // Execute damage\
      \ spell logic\n    CastSpell(SPELL_MIND_BLAST);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal AI configuration and may not reflect real-time
    specialization changes during combat. It is recommended to call this method before
    performing actions that depend on the priest's role.
  warnings: The method does not validate if the underlying unit is actually a priest;
    it only checks the AI instance's configuration. Ensure proper unit validation
    before relying on this check in critical gameplay logic.
