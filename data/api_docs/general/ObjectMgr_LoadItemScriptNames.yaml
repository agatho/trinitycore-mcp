  method: LoadItemScriptNames
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadItemScriptNames()
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes item script names from the database into memory for
    use in game mechanics.
  description: The LoadItemScriptNames method retrieves all item script name entries
    from the database table 'item_script_names' and populates an internal lookup structure.
    This allows the game engine to quickly associate specific scripts with items during
    runtime, enabling custom behaviors such as quest rewards, special item effects,
    or scripted interactions. The method is typically invoked during server startup
    or database reload operations to ensure that all item script mappings are available
    for processing. It does not require any parameters and performs no direct return
    value operations; instead, it updates internal state used by other systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeServer()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::instance()->LoadItemScriptNames();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ObjectMgr's database loading sequence and should
    only be called after the database connection has been established. It uses a thread-safe
    internal storage mechanism to manage script name mappings, making it safe for
    concurrent access once loaded.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    duplicate entries or memory leaks. Ensure that database connections are valid
    before invoking this function.
