  class: MotionMaster
  method: RemoveFlag
  signature: void MotionMaster::RemoveFlag(const uint8 flag)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified motion flag from the MotionMaster's active flags.
  description: The RemoveFlag method removes a given motion flag from the internal
    flag set managed by the MotionMaster. This is typically used to disable or clear
    specific movement behaviors or states for an AI-controlled unit. The method operates
    on a bitmask of motion flags, allowing fine-grained control over the unit's movement
    state. It is commonly invoked when a movement behavior needs to be terminated
    or when transitioning between different movement states.
  parameters:
  - name: flag
    description: The motion flag to remove from the MotionMaster's active flags. This
      should be a valid flag value defined in the motion flag enumeration, typically
      representing specific movement behaviors or states such as walking, running,
      flying, or path following.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Movement Flag
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = unit->GetMotionMaster();

      mm->RemoveFlag(MOTIONFLAG_WALKING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Multiple Motion Flags
    code: 'MotionMaster* mm = unit->GetMotionMaster();

      mm->RemoveFlag(MOTIONFLAG_RUNNING | MOTIONFLAG_FLYING);

      // Clears both running and flying flags'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the MotionMaster directly. It's
    important to ensure that the flag being removed is one that was previously set,
    otherwise the operation has no effect. The MotionMaster maintains a bitmask of
    active motion flags, and this method performs a bitwise AND operation with the
    negation of the provided flag.
  warnings: Be cautious when removing flags as it may affect the unit's movement behavior
    unexpectedly. Ensure that the flag being removed is appropriate for the current
    state of the AI to prevent unintended movement states or behaviors.
