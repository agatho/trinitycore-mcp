  method: IsItemUsableByBot
  signature: bool TradeManager::IsItemUsableByBot(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given item can be used by a bot in the context of trade
    operations.
  description: The IsItemUsableByBot method evaluates whether a specified Item object
    is eligible for use within the bot's trading system. This typically involves checking
    if the item meets certain criteria such as being usable, not bound, and compatible
    with the bot's current trade configuration. The method ensures that only appropriate
    items are considered during automated trading processes to maintain game balance
    and prevent exploits. It is commonly used in trade logic to filter out invalid
    or restricted items before attempting to process trades.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item can be used by the bot for trading purposes, false
    otherwise. The evaluation considers item usability flags, binding status, and
    trade restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (tradeManager.IsItemUsableByBot(item)) {\n    // Proceed with trade\
      \ logic\n    tradeManager.AddToTradeList(item);\n} else {\n    // Skip unusable\
      \ item\n    continue;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks on item flags, binding status, and trade
    restrictions. It may also consider the bot's inventory capacity or specific trade
    rules defined in the configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that the Item pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid
    null pointer dereferences. The method might not account for temporary item states
    such as those during enchantment or socketing processes.
