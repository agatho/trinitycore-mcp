  class: WarriorAI
  method: ManageInterceptUsage
  signature: void WarriorAI::ManageInterceptUsage(::Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Manages the usage of the Intercept ability for a warrior AI unit.
  description: The ManageInterceptUsage method controls when and how a warrior AI
    unit should use the Intercept ability. This method evaluates the current combat
    situation, including target position, threat level, and available mana, to determine
    if Intercept should be cast. It ensures that the warrior uses this defensive ability
    strategically rather than randomly, improving overall combat effectiveness. The
    method typically checks if the target is within range and if the warrior has sufficient
    resources before attempting to use Intercept.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The Unit object representing the target enemy that the warrior AI
      will attempt to intercept. This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing
      Unit, otherwise the method may cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n  \
      \      return;\n\n    Unit* target = GetVictim();\n    if (target)\n    {\n\
      \        ManageInterceptUsage(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the warrior AI behavior system and should only be
    called during active combat situations. The implementation assumes that the warrior
    has the Intercept ability available and that it's not on cooldown.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null or invalid pointer may lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
    This method does not perform any validation on the target's state or validity.
