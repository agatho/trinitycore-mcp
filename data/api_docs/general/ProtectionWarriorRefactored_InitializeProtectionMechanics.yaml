  brief: Initializes all protection mechanics and states for the warrior class
  description: The InitializeProtectionMechanics method sets up and configures all
    necessary protection-related systems and states for a Protection Warrior class
    instance. This includes initializing defensive abilities, stance management, shield
    block mechanics, and other protection-specific gameplay elements that are fundamental
    to the warrior's role in tanking and mitigating damage. The method ensures that
    all protection mechanics are properly initialized before the warrior enters combat
    or begins performing protective actions.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'ProtectionWarriorRefactored warrior;

      warrior.InitializeProtectionMechanics();

      // Warrior is now ready to perform protection abilities'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during class initialization or when
    a new Protection Warrior instance is created. It may internally set up internal
    state variables, register event handlers, and configure ability cooldowns specific
    to protection gameplay.
