  class: CreatureAI
  method: EnterEvadeMode
  signature: void CreatureAI::EnterEvadeMode(int why)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature to its evade mode, stopping current actions and returning
    to default state.
  description: The EnterEvadeMode method is used to force a creature AI to enter evade
    mode, which typically occurs when the creature's target is lost or when it needs
    to return to its default behavior. This method stops any ongoing combat actions,
    clears the current target, and resets the AI state to allow the creature to resume
    normal patrol or idle behavior. The 'why' parameter indicates the reason for entering
    evade mode, which can affect how the creature behaves upon re-engagement. This
    is commonly used during combat when a creature loses its target or when specific
    game events require the creature to return to a neutral state.
  parameters:
  - name: why
    description: An integer value indicating the reason for entering evade mode. Values
      typically represent different game states such as losing target, being interrupted,
      or completing an objective. The exact meaning depends on implementation within
      the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat AI
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        EnterEvadeMode(0); // Evade due to loss of target\n        return;\n\
      \    }\n    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using different evade reasons
    code: "void MyCreatureAI::OnDamageTaken(Unit* attacker, uint32 damage)\n{\n  \
      \  if (health < 1000)\n    {\n        EnterEvadeMode(1); // Evade due to low\
      \ health\n        return;\n    }\n    // ... continue with normal behavior\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the creature is in an active combat
    or alert state. It resets all current AI actions and targets, so calling it during
    critical moments may interrupt important mechanics. The 'why' parameter allows
    for different handling of evade behavior based on context.
  warnings: Calling EnterEvadeMode while the creature is already in evade mode can
    cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that the creature has a valid target or patrol
    path before calling this method to avoid infinite evade loops.
