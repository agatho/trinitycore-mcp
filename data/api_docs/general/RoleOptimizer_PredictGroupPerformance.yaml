  class: RoleOptimizer
  method: PredictGroupPerformance
  signature: float RoleOptimizer::PredictGroupPerformance(const int & assignments,
    const int & players, uint32 contentId)
documentation:
  brief: Predicts the performance of a group based on role assignments and player
    count for specific content.
  description: The PredictGroupPerformance method evaluates how effectively a group
    of players will perform in a given content instance based on their role assignments.
    It takes into account the number of assigned roles, total players, and the specific
    content ID to calculate a performance prediction score. This method is used primarily
    in group composition analysis and raid planning within TrinityCore's dungeon and
    raid management systems. The prediction considers optimal role distribution and
    player efficiency for the specified content type.
  parameters:
  - name: assignments
    description: The number of role assignments made to players in the group. This
      represents how many specific roles (tank, healer, damage dealer) have been assigned.
  - name: players
    description: The total number of players in the group. Must be a positive integer
      representing active participants.
  - name: contentId
    description: Unique identifier for the content instance (dungeon, raid, etc.).
      Used to determine specific performance metrics based on content requirements.
  returns: Returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the predicted group
    performance. A value of 1.0 indicates optimal performance, while 0.0 indicates
    poor performance. Values closer to 1.0 suggest better role distribution and player
    efficiency.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Performance Prediction
    code: 'float performance = optimizer.PredictGroupPerformance(5, 10, 1234);

      // Returns a performance score for a group of 10 players with 5 role assignments
      in content ID 1234'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimal Group Analysis
    code: 'RoleOptimizer optimizer;

      float highPerformance = optimizer.PredictGroupPerformance(8, 8, 5678);

      float lowPerformance = optimizer.PredictGroupPerformance(3, 10, 5678);

      // Compares performance between optimal (8/8) and suboptimal (3/10) role assignments'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during group creation or raid setup to evaluate
    potential team effectiveness. The performance score is calculated using internal
    algorithms that consider role balance, player class distribution, and content-specific
    requirements. The method assumes valid inputs and does not perform input validation.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected results if the contentId does not correspond
    to a known content type in the database. Input parameters should be validated
    before calling to avoid division by zero or invalid calculations. This method
    is not thread-safe and should not be called concurrently from multiple threads
    without proper synchronization.
