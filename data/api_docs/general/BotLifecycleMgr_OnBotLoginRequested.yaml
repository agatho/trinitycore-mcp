  class: BotLifecycleMgr
  method: OnBotLoginRequested
  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLoginRequested(int guid, const std::string
    & pattern)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the login request for a bot by processing its unique identifier and
    pattern.
  description: The OnBotLoginRequested method is invoked when a bot attempts to log
    into the game world. It takes the bot's unique identifier (GUID) and a pattern
    string which may contain login credentials or session data. This method likely
    validates the bot's login attempt, initializes its in-game state, and prepares
    it for gameplay. The pattern parameter could be used for authentication tokens,
    account information, or other session-specific data required to establish the
    bot's presence in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot requesting login. This value
      is typically a positive integer representing the bot's database entry.
  - name: pattern
    description: A string pattern containing login information or session data. The
      format and content of this string depend on the bot's authentication mechanism
      and may include tokens, passwords, or other identifying information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Login Request
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLoginRequested(12345, "auth_token_abc123");
    language: cpp
  - title: Bot Login with Session Data
    code: 'std::string sessionData = "session_id=xyz789&timestamp=1609459200";

      BotLifecycleMgr::OnBotLoginRequested(98765, sessionData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot lifecycle management system and should be
    called only when a bot is ready to enter the game world. It's expected that the
    GUID corresponds to an existing bot in the database. The pattern parameter must
    be properly formatted for successful authentication.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid GUID or malformed pattern may result
    in login failure or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all bots have valid entries
    before invoking this method.
