documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ShadowDoTTracker class for managing shadow
    damage over time effects.
  description: The ShadowDoTTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    ShadowDoTTracker class, which is responsible for tracking and managing shadow-based
    damage-over-time (DoT) effects in World of Warcraft. This class likely handles
    the application, updating, and removal of shadow DoTs on targets, including tracking
    duration, damage values, and stacking mechanics. The constructor sets up internal
    data structures necessary for maintaining state information about active shadow
    DoT effects on creatures or players. It prepares the tracker to receive and process
    events related to DoT application, tick updates, and expiration.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a ShadowDoTTracker instance
    code: 'ShadowDoTTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track shadow DoTs'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely initializes internal member variables such as effect
    lists, timers, and tracking data structures. It should be called before attempting
    to apply or update any shadow DoT effects.
