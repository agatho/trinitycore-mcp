  class: Aura
  method: CalcMaxStackAmount
  signature: uint32 Aura::CalcMaxStackAmount() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the maximum stack amount for the aura.
  description: The CalcMaxStackAmount method determines the maximum number of times
    an aura can be stacked based on its properties and effects. This calculation considers
    various factors such as the aura's base stacking limits, any modifiers applied
    by spells or items, and the specific mechanics governing how many times a particular
    aura type can accumulate. The result is used internally by the TrinityCore framework
    to enforce stacking rules for buffs, debuffs, and other magical effects in World
    of Warcraft gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the maximum stack count allowed for
    this aura. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the aura cannot be stacked
    at all, while higher values represent the upper limit of how many times the aura
    effect can be applied simultaneously.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nuint32 maxStacks = aura->CalcMaxStackAmount();\n\
      if (maxStacks > 0)\n{\n    // Process stacking logic\n    printf(\"Maximum stacks\
      \ allowed: %u\\n\", maxStacks);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during aura application or update cycles
    to determine whether additional stacks can be added. It may involve complex calculations
    based on spell properties, item bonuses, and player state. The result should not
    be cached unless the aura's properties are guaranteed not to change.
  warnings: Do not assume that all auras will have stackable effects; some auras may
    return 0, indicating they cannot be stacked. Calling this method on a null aura
    pointer will result in undefined behavior.
