  signature: void SafeExecutionEngine::~SafeExecutionEngine()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SafeExecutionEngine instance and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SafeExecutionEngine class is responsible for
    properly cleaning up any allocated memory, releasing references to managed objects,
    and ensuring that no dangling pointers or resource leaks occur. This method is
    automatically invoked when a SafeExecutionEngine object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's architecture, this destructor
    ensures safe cleanup of execution contexts and prevents potential memory corruption
    or undefined behavior during server shutdown or object lifecycle management.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction at scope exit
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    SafeExecutionEngine engine;\n    // ... perform\
      \ operations with engine\n} // Destructor called automatically here"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of heap-allocated instance
    code: 'SafeExecutionEngine* engine = new SafeExecutionEngine();

      // ... use engine

      delete engine; // Triggers destructor'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called by the C++ runtime during object destruction.
    It's important to ensure that no other threads are actively using the engine when
    it's being destroyed, as this could lead to race conditions or undefined behavior.
    The SafeExecutionEngine may maintain internal state that needs proper cleanup
    to avoid memory leaks.
  warnings: Do not call the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects; let the
    compiler handle automatic destruction. Avoid accessing members of the object after
    its destructor has been invoked, as this leads to undefined behavior.
