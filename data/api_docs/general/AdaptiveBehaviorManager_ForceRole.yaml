  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: ForceRole
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::ForceRole(BotRole role, bool temporary)
documentation:
  brief: Forces a bot to assume a specific role, either temporarily or permanently.
  description: The ForceRole method is used to override the adaptive behavior of a
    bot by assigning it a specific role. This can be useful for temporarily changing
    a bot's behavior during special events or quests, or for setting a permanent role
    when desired. The method accepts a BotRole enum value and a boolean flag indicating
    whether the role assignment should be temporary or persistent. When temporary
    is set to true, the bot will revert to its adaptive behavior once the temporary
    role expires or is explicitly removed. When false, the role becomes the bot's
    default behavior until manually changed.
  parameters:
  - name: role
    description: The BotRole enum value that specifies which role to assign to the
      bot. Valid values include roles such as TANK, HEALER, DAMAGE, or other custom
      roles defined in the TrinityCore AI system.
  - name: temporary
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether the role assignment should be temporary
      (true) or permanent (false). If true, the bot will eventually return to its
      adaptive behavior; if false, the role becomes the bot's default behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Assign a temporary tank role
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = player->GetBotAI()->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      manager->ForceRole(BotRole::TANK, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Set a permanent healer role
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* manager = player->GetBotAI()->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      manager->ForceRole(BotRole::HEALER, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the bot's behavior state and bypasses normal
    adaptive decision-making. It should be used carefully to avoid disrupting intended
    gameplay mechanics or causing unexpected behavior in group scenarios.
  warnings: Using ForceRole with temporary = false will permanently override a bot's
    adaptive behavior unless explicitly reset. Improper use may lead to bots behaving
    inconsistently with their assigned class or role during group activities.
