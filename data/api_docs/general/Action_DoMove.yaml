api:
  class: Action
  method: DoMove
  signature: bool Action::DoMove(BotAI * ai, float x, float y, float z)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a movement action for a bot AI to a specified location in the world.
  description: The DoMove method is used by the BotAI class to instruct a bot character
    to move to a specific coordinate (x, y, z) within the game world. It handles pathfinding
    and movement execution internally, returning true if the movement was successfully
    initiated or false if it failed due to invalid parameters, obstacles, or other
    constraints. This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI actions
    to create complex bot behaviors such as following targets, navigating to waypoints,
    or moving to strategic positions during combat or exploration.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that controls the bot character. This
      parameter is required and must not be null for the method to function properly.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the destination point in the game world. Must
      be a valid floating-point number representing a position within the map boundaries.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the destination point in the game world. Must
      be a valid floating-point number representing a position within the map boundaries.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate (height) of the destination point in the game world.
      Must be a valid floating-point number representing a position within the map
      boundaries.
  returns: Returns true if the movement was successfully initiated and the bot started
    moving towards the specified coordinates, or false if the movement could not be
    started due to invalid parameters, pathfinding failures, or other internal errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Movement Example
    code: "BotAI* ai = ...; // Get reference to bot AI\nfloat x = 100.0f;\nfloat y\
      \ = 200.0f;\nfloat z = 50.0f;\nbool success = ai->DoMove(ai, x, y, z);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Movement initiated successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate\
      \ movement\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Movement with Error Handling
    code: "BotAI* ai = ...;\nfloat x = 100.0f;\nfloat y = 200.0f;\nfloat z = 50.0f;\n\
      \nif (ai->DoMove(ai, x, y, z)) {\n    // Movement started - log success\n  \
      \  sLog->outString(\"Bot movement initiated to (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\", x, y, z);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failure case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to initiate\
      \ bot movement to (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)\", x, y, z);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying TrinityCore pathfinding system and may
    block briefly while calculating paths or checking for collisions. It's recommended
    to call this method from within the AI's main update loop rather than in high-frequency
    contexts. The coordinates should be within valid map boundaries, otherwise movement
    will fail.
  warnings: Do not pass null pointers for the ai parameter as it will likely cause
    a crash. Ensure that the destination coordinates are within valid map boundaries
    to avoid silent failures. This method does not guarantee that the bot will reach
    the exact specified coordinates due to pathfinding limitations or dynamic obstacles
    in the environment.
