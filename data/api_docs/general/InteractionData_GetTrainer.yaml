  class: InteractionData
  method: GetTrainer
  signature: TrainerData * InteractionData::GetTrainer()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the trainer data associated with this interaction.
  description: The GetTrainer method retrieves the TrainerData object that contains
    information about a trainer interaction, such as the trainer's ID, available spells,
    and training costs. This method is typically used in the context of player-trainer
    interactions within World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework. The returned pointer
    may be null if no valid trainer data exists for the current interaction. This
    method does not perform any validation or modification of the underlying data;
    it simply provides access to the associated trainer information.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a TrainerData object containing trainer-specific information,
    or nullptr if no trainer data is available for this interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "TrainerData* trainer = interactionData->GetTrainer();\nif (trainer != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Process trainer data\n    uint32 trainerId = trainer->GetTrainerId();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Valid Trainer Data
    code: "InteractionData* interaction = player->GetInteraction();\nif (interaction\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    TrainerData* trainer = interaction->GetTrainer();\n  \
      \  if (trainer != nullptr)\n    {\n        // Proceed with trainer-related operations\n\
      \        std::vector<uint32> spells = trainer->GetSpells();\n        // ...\
      \ process spells\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No trainer data available\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned TrainerData pointer is valid only as long as the InteractionData
    object remains in scope and has not been modified. This method does not perform
    any locking or thread safety checks, so access should be synchronized if used
    in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Always check for null return values before dereferencing the returned
    pointer to avoid segmentation faults. The TrainerData object may be invalidated
    if the interaction changes or is destroyed.
