documentation:
  brief: Updates all bot systems and AI behaviors based on elapsed time
  description: The UpdateBotSystems method is responsible for processing and updating
    all active player bot systems within the TrinityCore world environment. This method
    is typically called from the main game loop at regular intervals to ensure that
    bot AI behaviors, movement patterns, combat decisions, and other automated actions
    are properly maintained and executed. The method processes various bot subsystems
    including combat logic, quest handling, loot management, and general behavior
    updates based on the time delta provided. It serves as a central coordination
    point for all bot-related activities in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other world updates\n  \
      \  sPlayerbotAI->UpdateBotSystems(diff);\n    // ... other world updates\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Bot Manager
    code: "class MyBotManager\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAllBots(uint32 diff)\n \
      \   {\n        // Perform custom bot pre-processing\n        sPlayerbotAI->UpdateBotSystems(diff);\n\
      \        // Perform custom bot post-processing\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called from the main game thread as it interacts
    with shared world state and bot data structures. The 'diff' parameter represents
    milliseconds since last update and is crucial for maintaining consistent timing
    across different server loads. Performance considerations include avoiding heavy
    operations within this method to prevent frame rate drops in the game world.
  warnings: Do not call this method from multiple threads simultaneously as it may
    cause race conditions with bot data structures. Avoid performing long-running
    operations within this method as it directly affects the responsiveness of all
    player bots in the world.
