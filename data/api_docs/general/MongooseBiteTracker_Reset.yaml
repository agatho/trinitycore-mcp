  method: Reset
  signature: void MongooseBiteTracker::Reset()
documentation:
  brief: Resets the mongoose bite tracker to its initial state, clearing all recorded
    bite data and resetting internal counters.
  description: The Reset method clears all accumulated bite tracking data within the
    MongooseBiteTracker instance. This includes resetting any internal counters, clearing
    stored bite timestamps or locations, and returning the tracker to its default
    initialized state. The method is typically invoked when a new tracking session
    begins or when existing data needs to be discarded. It ensures that subsequent
    calls to tracking methods will start with a clean slate, preventing carryover
    of previous session data. No parameters are required as the operation affects
    only the internal state of the object.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'MongooseBiteTracker tracker;

      // ... perform some tracking operations ...

      tracker.Reset(); // Clears all tracked data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before starting a new tracking session to ensure
    accurate data collection. It is not thread-safe and should only be invoked from
    the same thread that owns the tracker instance.
