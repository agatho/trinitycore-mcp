  signature: void Map::RemoveAreaTriggerFromMoveList(AreaTrigger * at)
documentation:
  brief: Removes an area trigger from the map's movement list.
  description: This method removes a specified AreaTrigger object from the internal
    movement list of the Map. It is typically called when an area trigger is no longer
    needed or has expired, ensuring that it is not processed during subsequent map
    updates. The operation ensures proper cleanup of resources associated with the
    area trigger and prevents further processing of its movement events. This method
    is part of the core game mechanics handling for area triggers in TrinityCore's
    world system.
  parameters:
  - name: at
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that should be removed from the
      map's movement list. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing an AreaTrigger from Movement List
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is a valid AreaTrigger pointer

      map->RemoveAreaTriggerFromMoveList(trigger);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal bookkeeping to maintain consistency
    in the map's area trigger tracking system. It should be called only when the area
    trigger is no longer active or has been destroyed to prevent memory leaks and
    ensure proper game state management.
