  method: IsLeaderInSight
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::IsLeaderInSight() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the leader is currently visible to the follower in the game world.
  description: The IsLeaderInSight method determines whether the current leader of
    a creature or NPC is within the visual field of the follower. This check considers
    factors such as line-of-sight, distance, and visibility restrictions imposed by
    the game environment. It's commonly used in AI behavior systems to control movement
    and interaction patterns based on the leader's visibility status. The method performs
    a raycast or similar visibility test from the follower's position toward the leader's
    position to determine if there are any obstructions preventing visual contact.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the leader is currently in sight of the follower, meaning
    there is a clear line-of-sight path between them without any blocking objects
    or environmental restrictions. Returns false if the leader is not visible, which
    could be due to being obstructed, too far away, or outside the follower's visual
    range.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (follower->GetBehavior()->IsLeaderInSight()) {\n    // Continue following\
      \ the leader\n    follower->MoveTo(leader->GetPosition());\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Leader is out of sight, search for them\n    follower->SetState(FOLLOW_STATE_SEARCHING);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in movement logic with fallback behavior
    code: "if (!follower->GetBehavior()->IsLeaderInSight()) {\n    // Leader not visible,\
      \ try to find them\n    if (follower->GetDistanceTo(leader) > 50.0f) {\n   \
      \     // If leader is too far, move toward their last known position\n     \
      \   follower->MoveTo(lastKnownPosition);\n    } else {\n        // Otherwise,\
      \ perform a search pattern\n        follower->PerformSearchPattern();\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically uses the game's internal visibility system and may
    be affected by lighting conditions, environmental effects, or other visual obstructions.
    The implementation might include optimizations such as cached visibility results
    or coarse collision checks before performing detailed raycasting. Performance-wise,
    this check should be used judiciously in frequently called AI routines.
  warnings: This method only checks for visual visibility and does not account for
    auditory or other sensory detection methods. It may return false even when the
    follower can still detect the leader through other means like sound or scent.
    Additionally, in some edge cases with complex terrain or large objects, the visibility
    check might not be perfectly accurate due to limitations in the underlying collision
    detection system.
