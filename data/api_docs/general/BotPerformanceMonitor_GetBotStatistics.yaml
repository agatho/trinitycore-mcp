  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: GetBotStatistics
  signature: MetricStatistics BotPerformanceMonitor::GetBotStatistics(uint32_t botGuid,
    MetricType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves statistical metrics for a specified bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The GetBotStatistics method fetches performance or activity statistics
    for a specific bot within the TrinityCore framework. It takes a unique identifier
    (GUID) of the bot and a metric type to determine which kind of statistics to retrieve.
    This function is typically used in monitoring systems or administrative tools
    to analyze bot behavior, resource usage, or operational efficiency. The method
    operates on data stored internally by the BotPerformanceMonitor class and returns
    a structured MetricStatistics object containing relevant statistical information.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which statistics are
      to be retrieved. Must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: type
    description: Specifies the type of metric statistics to retrieve. This parameter
      determines what kind of data is returned, such as CPU usage, memory consumption,
      or activity counts.
  returns: A MetricStatistics object containing the requested statistical data for
    the specified bot. The structure of this object includes various fields like average
    values, maximums, minimums, and counts based on the provided metric type.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve CPU usage statistics for a bot
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      MetricType type = MetricType::CPU_USAGE;

      MetricStatistics stats = monitor.GetBotStatistics(botGuid, type);

      // Use stats to display or log CPU usage metrics'
    language: cpp
  - title: Get memory consumption statistics for multiple bots
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids) {\n    MetricStatistics stats = monitor.GetBotStatistics(guid,\
      \ MetricType::MEMORY_USAGE);\n    // Process and aggregate memory usage data\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot GUID exists in the system and that the corresponding
    statistics have been collected. It is thread-safe if used with proper locking
    mechanisms in multi-threaded environments. Performance may be impacted when retrieving
    statistics for a large number of bots simultaneously.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID might result
    in undefined behavior or exceptions depending on implementation. Ensure that the
    bot exists before calling this function to avoid errors.
