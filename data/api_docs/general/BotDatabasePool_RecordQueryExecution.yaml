  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: RecordQueryExecution
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::RecordQueryExecution(int startTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records the execution time of a database query for performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordQueryExecution method logs the duration of a database operation
    by calculating the difference between the provided start time and the current
    time. This method is typically used in conjunction with timing mechanisms to monitor
    query performance within the BotDatabasePool class. It helps identify slow-running
    queries that may impact server performance or responsiveness. The method does
    not return any value but contributes to internal performance tracking metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: startTime
    description: The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) when the database query execution
      began. This value is used to calculate the total execution time of the query.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 startTime = getMSTime();

      // Execute database query here

      botDatabasePool->RecordQueryExecution(startTime);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the startTime parameter represents a valid timestamp
    obtained from a high-resolution timer. It's recommended to use timing functions
    like getMSTime() or similar for accurate measurements.
