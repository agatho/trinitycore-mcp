  class: BotHealthCheck
  method: GetStallThreshold
  signature: uint32 BotHealthCheck::GetStallThreshold() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the health threshold value used to determine when a bot should
    enter a stalled state.
  description: The GetStallThreshold method returns the configured health percentage
    below which a bot is considered to be in a stalled state. This value is typically
    used by the AI system to make decisions about whether a bot should attempt to
    recover from low health or switch to a different behavior pattern. The threshold
    is usually defined as a percentage of maximum health, and when a bot's current
    health drops below this level, it triggers specific stall-related behaviors such
    as seeking healing or retreating. This method does not modify any internal state
    and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the health threshold percentage (e.g., 20 for
    20% of maximum health). When a bot's current health falls below this percentage,
    it is considered to be in a stalled state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 stallThreshold = botHealthCheck->GetStallThreshold();\nif (player->GetHealth()\
      \ < (player->GetMaxHealth() * stallThreshold / 100)) {\n    // Bot is in stall\
      \ state\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateStallState() {\n    uint32 threshold = healthCheck->GetStallThreshold();\n\
      \    uint32 currentHealth = GetHealth();\n    uint32 maxHealth = GetMaxHealth();\n\
      \    \n    if (currentHealth < (maxHealth * threshold / 100)) {\n        SetBotState(BotState::STALL);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to make real-time
    decisions about bot behavior. The returned value should be interpreted as a percentage,
    where 100 represents maximum health and 0 represents zero health. This method
    is thread-safe and does not perform any expensive operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the threshold value is properly validated before using it
    in calculations to avoid division by zero or incorrect comparisons. The returned
    value may be cached internally, so changes to the configuration might not immediately
    reflect in subsequent calls.
