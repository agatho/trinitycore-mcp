  class: CreatureAI
  method: JustSummoned
  signature: void CreatureAI::JustSummoned(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature summoned by this AI finishes summoning.
  description: The JustSummoned method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework when
    a creature that was summoned through this CreatureAI instance has completed its
    summoning process. This callback allows the AI to perform actions immediately
    after a summoned creature becomes active in the world, such as setting initial
    behavior, assigning targets, or triggering events. The method is part of the CreatureAI's
    event handling system and is typically used for post-summon logic that requires
    the summoned creature to be fully initialized before execution. It is important
    to note that this method is only called for creatures summoned via the AI's summoning
    functions, not for all creatures in the world.
  parameters:
  - name: summon
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that was just summoned. This parameter
      represents the summoned creature instance which has now been added to the world
      and is fully initialized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for summoned creature initialization
    code: "void BossAI::JustSummoned(Creature* summon)\n{\n    if (summon->GetEntry()\
      \ == NPC_SUMMONED_MINION)\n    {\n        summon->SetReactState(REACT_AGGRESSIVE);\n\
      \        summon->AttackStart(me->GetVictim());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering event on summoned creature
    code: "void ShadowLordAI::JustSummoned(Creature* summon)\n{\n    if (summon->GetEntry()\
      \ == NPC_SHADOW_GOLEM)\n    {\n        summon->CastSpell(summon, SPELL_SUMMON_EFFECT,\
      \ true);\n        summon->SetFlag(UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard CreatureAI callback system and is automatically
    invoked by the core when a summoned creature becomes active. Developers should
    ensure that any logic implemented here does not cause performance issues, as it
    may be called frequently during combat encounters. The summoned creature parameter
    will always be valid and fully initialized at this point.
  warnings: Do not attempt to summon additional creatures from within this method
    without careful consideration, as it may lead to stack overflow or unexpected
    behavior. Also, be aware that the summoned creature's AI might not yet have been
    initialized with its own AI script when this callback is executed.
