documentation:
  brief: Removes all fixate effects from the threat manager's current target.
  description: The ClearFixate method removes any active fixate effects that have
    been applied to the current target within the ThreatManager. Fixate is a combat
    mechanic in World of Warcraft where an enemy is forced to focus its attacks on
    a specific target, typically used by certain bosses or abilities. This method
    ensures that no fixate effects remain on the target, allowing normal threat generation
    and targeting behavior to resume. The method operates on the current target of
    the ThreatManager and has no parameters or return values.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clearing Fixate Effects
    code: 'ThreatManager* threatMgr = unit->GetThreatManager();

      threatMgr->ClearFixate();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called when removing or resetting fixate effects from
    a target. It is typically invoked during boss encounter mechanics, such as when
    a boss removes its fixate ability or when a player successfully breaks out of
    a fixate state.
