  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::ProposeEventIdeas(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Proposes new event ideas for guild members to consider.
  description: The ProposeEventIdeas method generates and presents potential event
    concepts to guild members for discussion and voting. This functionality is typically
    used within the context of guild event coordination where players can suggest
    activities such as raids, dungeons, or social events. The method likely interacts
    with the guild's event system to store and broadcast these proposals to all eligible
    participants. It may also handle validation of proposal content and ensure that
    only appropriate ideas are presented to the guild.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Event Coordinator
    code: 'GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.ProposeEventIdeas(nullptr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the calling player to have appropriate guild
    permissions to propose events. Implementation may involve database operations
    to store event ideas and network communication to broadcast proposals to guild
    members.
  warnings: The method signature suggests it takes a pointer to an integer representing
    a player, but the parameter is unused in the documented signature. This could
    be a remnant from an earlier implementation or indicate that player context is
    handled elsewhere.
