  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: FocusPvPTarget
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::FocusPvPTarget(Player * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the specified player as the focus target for PvP-related behavior in
    the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
  description: The FocusPvPTarget method configures the AdvancedBehaviorManager to
    prioritize the given Player object as the target for PvP-specific actions and
    behaviors. This typically involves setting internal state variables or flags that
    influence how the AI responds to player interactions during PvP encounters. The
    method likely affects targeting logic, threat generation, or behavior selection
    within the context of player-versus-player combat scenarios. It is expected that
    the target player must be valid and within the appropriate scope for PvP behaviors
    to be triggered.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Player object that should be focused as the PvP
      target. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid Player
      instance in the current world context.
  returns: None
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* pvpTarget = ...; // Assume this is a valid player pointer

      AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      behaviorMgr->FocusPvPTarget(pvpTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Validation
    code: "if (player && player->IsInWorld()) {\n    AdvancedBehaviorManager* mgr\
      \ = GetBehaviorManager();\n    if (mgr) {\n        mgr->FocusPvPTarget(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state within the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    to track PvP focus targets. It may also trigger updates to AI decision-making
    processes related to player engagement or threat prioritization.
  warnings: Ensure that the target Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes.
