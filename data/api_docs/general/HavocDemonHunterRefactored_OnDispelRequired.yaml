  method: OnDispelRequired
  signature: void HavocDemonHunterRefactored::OnDispelRequired(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the required dispel event for a Havoc Demon Hunter target
  description: The OnDispelRequired method is triggered when a Havoc Demon Hunter's
    abilities or effects are subject to dispel mechanics. This method typically manages
    the logic for removing harmful magical effects from a target, potentially involving
    cooldown resets, resource management, or state transitions specific to the Havoc
    Demon Hunter class. The method operates on a provided target reference and may
    modify its state or properties based on the dispel requirements. It is part of
    the core combat AI behavior for the Havoc Demon Hunter specialization in TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or state
      value that requires dispel action. This parameter may be used to determine which
      effects are removed or how the target's condition changes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OnDispelRequired
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      HavocDemonHunterRefactored hunter;

      hunter.OnDispelRequired(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked during combat when dispel mechanics are triggered,
    such as by a spell or ability that removes debuffs. It may be part of a larger
    AI decision-making loop and should be called with valid target references to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid memory location; passing
    null or invalid pointers can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in the TrinityCore
    environment.
