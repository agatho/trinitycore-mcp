  class: GarrisonMgr
  method: GetPlotGameObject
  signature: const GameObjectsEntry * GarrisonMgr::GetPlotGameObject(uint32 mapId,
    uint32 garrPlotInstanceId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the game object entry for a specified garrison plot instance.
  description: The GetPlotGameObject method retrieves the GameObjectsEntry associated
    with a given garrison plot instance ID on a specific map. This method is used
    internally by the Garrison system to fetch the appropriate game object template
    that represents a plot within a player's garrison. The returned entry contains
    information about the visual representation, placement, and behavior of the plot
    object in the world. It is typically called during garrison initialization or
    when displaying plot information to players.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The ID of the map where the garrison plot is located. This corresponds
      to the Map.dbc entry ID.
  - name: garrPlotInstanceId
    description: The unique instance ID of the garrison plot. This identifies a specific
      plot within the garrison's layout.
  returns: A pointer to the GameObjectsEntry structure that defines the properties
    of the garrison plot game object, or nullptr if no matching entry is found for
    the given parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve plot game object entry
    code: "const GameObjectsEntry* plotEntry = sGarrisonMgr->GetPlotGameObject(1234,\
      \ 5678);\nif (plotEntry)\n{\n    // Use the plot entry to determine plot properties\n\
      \    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"garrison\", \"Found plot entry for map {} instance {} with\
      \ display ID {}\", 1234, 5678, plotEntry->DisplayID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal garrison data structures and assumes that
    the provided mapId and garrPlotInstanceId are valid. The GameObjectsEntry returned
    is read-only and should not be modified directly.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent mapId/garrPlotInstanceId
    values may return nullptr, which must be checked before dereferencing the pointer.
    Ensure that the garrison system is properly initialized before calling this method.
