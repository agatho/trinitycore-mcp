  brief: Adds a transmog illusion to the player's collection.
  description: The AddTransmogIllusion method is used to add a specific transmogrification
    illusion to a player's collection in World of Warcraft. This method allows developers
    or game systems to grant players access to certain visual effects that can be
    applied to their gear through the transmogrification system. The illusion ID provided
    must correspond to a valid transmog illusion entry in the game's database. This
    method typically updates the player's collection data and may trigger UI updates
    or notifications to reflect the newly acquired illusion.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Granting a Transmog Illusion
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->AddTransmogIllusion(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's transmog collection database
    entry and may require synchronization with the client-side UI to display the new
    illusion. It is typically called during quest rewards, achievements, or other
    game events that grant transmog content.
  warnings: Ensure that the transmogIllusionId parameter corresponds to a valid illusion
    in the game's database; invalid IDs may cause errors or unexpected behavior. This
    method should not be called during critical sections of player data processing
    to avoid race conditions.
