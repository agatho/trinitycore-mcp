  brief: Initializes strategy values for AI behavior in the TrinityCore framework
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up and configures all necessary internal
    variables and data structures required for a strategy to function properly within
    the TrinityCore AI system. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of an AI strategy object, ensuring that all parameters, weights, and behavioral
    thresholds are correctly established before the strategy begins executing. It
    prepares the strategy for decision-making by loading default values, calculating
    derived parameters, and setting up any required state information. The method
    does not take any parameters and performs no direct return operations, but it
    is essential for proper AI behavior initialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Strategy Initialization
    code: 'Strategy* myStrategy = new Strategy();

      myStrategy->InitializeValues();

      // Strategy is now ready for use in AI decision making'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the strategy's lifecycle, typically
    after object construction but before any execution begins. It may perform memory
    allocations and calculations that could impact performance if called frequently.
