  method: OptimizeVendorQueries
  signature: void VendorInteraction::OptimizeVendorQueries()
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes database queries used during vendor item interactions to reduce
    latency and improve performance.
  description: The OptimizeVendorQueries method enhances the efficiency of database
    operations involved in vendor transactions by minimizing redundant or unnecessary
    SQL calls. It typically restructures or caches query results to avoid repeated
    lookups when players interact with vendors, such as buying or selling items. This
    optimization is particularly important in high-traffic environments where frequent
    vendor interactions could otherwise cause performance bottlenecks. The method
    does not require any parameters and modifies internal query structures for better
    resource utilization.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.OptimizeVendorQueries();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server initialization
    or when vendor data changes, but can also be manually called to refresh query
    optimizations. It may impact performance negatively if used excessively without
    proper context.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently or inappropriately might lead to unnecessary
    overhead or inconsistent caching behavior. Ensure it's only used when vendor-related
    queries are being modified or need reoptimization.
