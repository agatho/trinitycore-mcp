documentation:
  brief: Updates player zone statistics when changing zones
  description: This method updates player zone statistics when a player transitions
    from one zone to another. It handles the necessary adjustments to player data
    related to zone-based gameplay mechanics, including updating zone-related achievements,
    quest tracking, and other zone-dependent systems. The method ensures proper synchronization
    of player data with the new zone environment.
  parameters:
  - name: oldZone
    description: The zone ID that the player is transitioning from
  - name: newZone
    description: The zone ID that the player is transitioning to
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Zone Transition Example
    code: 'Map* map = player->GetMap();

      map->UpdatePlayerZoneStats(oldZone, newZone);

      // This updates zone statistics when player moves between zones'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include handling of zone-based achievements, quest
    tracking, and other zone-dependent systems. Performance considerations involve
    minimal overhead as it primarily updates internal player data structures.
  warnings: This method should only be called when player actually changes zones,
    not during regular gameplay updates. Improper use can lead to incorrect zone statistics
    and achievement tracking.
