  signature: bool Player::ProcessItemCast(SpellCastRequest & castRequest, const SpellCastTargets
    & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a spell cast request from an item, validating and executing the
    cast.
  description: The ProcessItemCast method handles the logic for casting spells that
    originate from items, such as consumables, weapons, or quest items. It validates
    the spell cast request against the player's current state, checks if the required
    conditions are met (such as item usability, cooldowns, mana/resources), and then
    proceeds to execute the spell. This method is typically invoked when a player
    attempts to use an item that has an associated spell effect. The method ensures
    proper handling of item-based spell casting within the game's mechanics, including
    target validation, resource consumption, and spell execution.
  parameters:
  - name: castRequest
    description: The SpellCastRequest structure containing details about the spell
      being cast from an item, such as spell ID, caster, and other casting parameters.
  - name: targets
    description: The SpellCastTargets structure defining the targets for the spell
      cast, including target GUIDs, positions, and other targeting information.
  returns: Returns true if the item-based spell cast was successfully processed and
    executed; otherwise returns false if validation failed or the cast could not be
    completed.

    code: "SpellCastRequest request;\nrequest.spellId = 12345;\nrequest.caster = player;\n\
      \nSpellCastTargets targets;\ntargets.setUnitTarget(target);\n\nbool result =\
      \ player->ProcessItemCast(request, targets);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Spell cast\
      \ was successful\n    player->SendSpellGo(request.spellId);\n}"

  notes: This method is part of the core spell casting system in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the broader spell handling infrastructure. It relies on proper initialization
    of the SpellCastRequest and SpellCastTargets structures before being called.
  warnings: Improperly initialized cast requests or targets can lead to undefined
    behavior or failed spell casts. Ensure that all required fields are set correctly
    before calling this method.
