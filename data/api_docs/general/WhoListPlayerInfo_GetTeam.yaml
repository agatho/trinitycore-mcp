documentation:
  brief: Returns the team ID of the player in the who list entry
  description: The GetTeam method retrieves the team identifier associated with a
    player in the WhoListPlayerInfo structure. This team ID corresponds to either
    the Alliance (team ID 67) or Horde (team ID 46) factions in World of Warcraft.
    The method is typically used when processing who list responses to determine which
    faction a player belongs to. The returned value represents the internal team identifier
    used by the TrinityCore server for faction tracking and display purposes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the team ID of the player. For Alliance players,
    this typically returns 67, and for Horde players, it returns 46. A value of 0
    may indicate an error or unknown faction state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to determine player faction
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo ...\nuint32 teamId\
      \ = playerInfo.GetTeam();\nif (teamId == 67)\n{\n    // Player is Alliance\n\
      \    printf(\"Player is part of the Alliance\\n\");\n}\nelse if (teamId == 46)\n\
      {\n    // Player is Horde\n    printf(\"Player is part of the Horde\\n\");\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Unknown faction or error condition\n    printf(\"Unknown\
      \ faction or invalid team ID: %u\\n\", teamId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides access to the raw team identifier used internally by
    TrinityCore. The values 67 and 46 are standard faction identifiers in the game's
    internal data structures, but may vary depending on server configuration or custom
    modifications.
