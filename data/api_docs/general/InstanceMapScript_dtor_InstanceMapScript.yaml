documentation:
  brief: Destroys an InstanceMapScript instance, cleaning up any allocated resources.
  description: The destructor for the InstanceMapScript class is responsible for releasing
    any memory or resources that were allocated during the lifetime of the instance.
    This method is automatically invoked when an InstanceMapScript object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. As a base class destructor, it ensures proper
    cleanup of derived class members and maintains the integrity of the script system
    within TrinityCore's instance management framework. The destructor does not take
    any parameters and performs no specific game logic; its primary purpose is resource
    management.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of InstanceMapScript
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    InstanceMapScript* script = new MyInstanceScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor is called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is virtual in the base class, allowing proper cleanup of derived
    instances. Developers should ensure that any custom cleanup logic in derived classes
    is properly implemented to avoid memory leaks.
