  method: OnPopulationChanged
  signature: void IBotSpawnerCallback::OnPopulationChanged(uint32 zoneId, uint32 oldCount,
    uint32 newCount)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies when the population count of bots in a specific zone has changed
  description: The OnPopulationChanged method is invoked by the bot spawner system
    to inform registered callbacks about changes in the number of active bots within
    a given zone. This callback mechanism allows systems to react to dynamic population
    shifts, such as when bots are spawned, despawned, or removed due to various game
    events. The method provides the zone identifier along with the previous and current
    population counts, enabling precise tracking of bot activity. It is typically
    used for maintaining synchronization between different subsystems that depend
    on accurate bot population data.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: Unique identifier of the zone where the bot population has changed.
      This value corresponds to a specific area in the game world, such as a battleground
      or instance.
  - name: oldCount
    description: The previous number of bots present in the specified zone before
      the change occurred.
  - name: newCount
    description: The updated number of bots currently present in the specified zone
      after the change occurred.
  returns: null

    code: "class MyBotSpawnerCallback : public IBotSpawnerCallback {\npublic:\n  \
      \  void OnPopulationChanged(uint32 zoneId, uint32 oldCount, uint32 newCount)\
      \ override {\n        if (newCount > oldCount) {\n            // Handle bot\
      \ spawn event\n            sLog->outString(\"Bots spawned in zone %u: %u ->\
      \ %u\", zoneId, oldCount, newCount);\n        } else if (newCount < oldCount)\
      \ {\n            // Handle bot despawn event\n            sLog->outString(\"\
      Bots despawned in zone %u: %u -> %u\", zoneId, oldCount, newCount);\n      \
      \  }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called from the main game thread and should not perform long-running
    operations. It's intended for lightweight notifications only. The callback system
    ensures that all registered implementations receive the notification, but developers
    must ensure their implementations are efficient to avoid performance bottlenecks.
  warnings: Do not modify bot population counts directly within this method unless
    absolutely necessary, as it may lead to race conditions or infinite recursion.
    Avoid performing heavy computations or blocking operations inside this callback
    to maintain game responsiveness.
