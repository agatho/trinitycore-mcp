  class: Conversation
  method: GetLineDuration
  signature: int Conversation::GetLineDuration(int locale, int lineId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the duration in milliseconds of a specific conversation line for
    the given locale.
  description: The GetLineDuration method returns the time duration in milliseconds
    that a specific conversation line should be displayed for a given locale. This
    is used internally by the game engine to control how long dialogue text remains
    visible during NPC conversations. The method takes into account localization settings
    and may return different durations based on the specified locale. It's typically
    called when preparing or playing conversation events to ensure proper timing of
    dialogue display.
  parameters:
  - name: locale
    description: The locale identifier specifying which language version of the conversation
      line duration to retrieve. Valid values correspond to client locale IDs (e.g.,
      0 for enUS, 1 for koKR, etc.).
  - name: lineId
    description: The unique identifier of the conversation line for which to retrieve
      the duration. This corresponds to a specific line within a conversation template.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the duration in milliseconds that the specified
    conversation line should be displayed for the given locale. Returns 0 if the line
    or locale is not found or invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Get Duration for English Line
    code: "int duration = conversation->GetLineDuration(0, 12345);\nif (duration >\
      \ 0) {\n    // Use duration to control dialogue timing\n    printf(\"Dialogue\
      \ line will display for %d ms\\n\", duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handle Multiple Locales
    code: 'int koreanDuration = conversation->GetLineDuration(1, 12345);

      int frenchDuration = conversation->GetLineDuration(2, 12345);

      printf("Korean duration: %d ms, French duration: %d ms\n", koreanDuration, frenchDuration);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the conversation system and may
    not be directly called from user scripts. The duration values are typically defined
    in the game's database or configuration files and can vary per locale based on
    translation length and cultural timing preferences.
  warnings: The method may return 0 for invalid line IDs or locales, which should
    be handled gracefully by calling code. Do not assume all conversation lines have
    the same duration across different locales.
