  class: QuestPickup
  method: WaitForGroupQuestDecisions
  signature: void QuestPickup::WaitForGroupQuestDecisions(Group * group, uint32 questId,
    uint32 timeoutMs)
documentation:
  brief: Waits for group members to make quest pickup decisions within a specified
    timeout period.
  description: The WaitForGroupQuestDecisions method is used in TrinityCore's quest
    system to synchronize quest pickup decisions among group members. It blocks execution
    until all eligible group members have made their decision or the specified timeout
    period has elapsed. This ensures that quest progression is handled consistently
    across group members, particularly important for quests that require coordinated
    actions or shared rewards. The method operates on a Group object and waits for
    individual player responses to a specific quest ID. It's typically used during
    quest initiation or acceptance phases where group coordination is necessary.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who need to make quest
      decisions. Must be a valid group instance with at least one member.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which group members must decide
      whether to accept or decline. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  - name: timeoutMs
    description: Maximum time in milliseconds to wait for all group members to make
      their decisions. If zero, waits indefinitely until all members respond.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with a 30-second timeout
    code: 'Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 timeoutMs = 30000;

      questPickup->WaitForGroupQuestDecisions(myGroup, questId, timeoutMs);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Infinite wait for group quest decisions
    code: 'Group* group = player->GetGroup();

      uint32 questId = 67890;

      questPickup->WaitForGroupQuestDecisions(group, questId, 0); // Wait indefinitely'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should only be called from
    within the game's main thread context. It internally handles synchronization between
    group members using TrinityCore's internal quest decision tracking system. The
    timeout mechanism ensures that the game doesn't hang indefinitely if players don't
    respond, which could occur in cases of disconnected players or client issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with a zero timeout may cause indefinite blocking
    if not all group members respond, potentially leading to performance issues. It's
    recommended to always specify a reasonable timeout value. Also, ensure that the
    Group pointer is valid and contains at least one member before calling this method.
