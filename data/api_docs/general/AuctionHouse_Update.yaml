  class: AuctionHouse
  method: Update
  signature: void AuctionHouse::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the auction house state, processing auctions and handling expiration.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining the auction house
    functionality by processing expired auctions, updating auction listings, and managing
    the auction house's internal state. This method is typically called from the game
    loop at regular intervals to ensure that auctions are properly managed and that
    the auction house remains synchronized with the game world. It handles tasks such
    as removing expired auctions, notifying bidders of results, and updating the database
    or in-memory structures accordingly. The method operates on a time-based interval
    specified by the 'diff' parameter which represents the elapsed milliseconds since
    the last update.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The number of milliseconds that have passed since the last auction
      house update. This value is used to determine how much time has elapsed for
      processing auction expirations and other time-sensitive operations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateAuctionHouse(uint32 diff)\n{\n    sAuctionHouseMgr->Update(diff);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void World::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other updates...\n    auctionHouse->Update(diff);\n\
      \    // Other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly from the main game loop to ensure
    proper auction house functionality. The 'diff' parameter is crucial for accurate
    time-based processing of auctions. The implementation likely involves checking
    for expired auctions and performing cleanup operations, which may include database
    updates or sending notifications to players.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect 'diff' values can cause auctions to
    expire at wrong times or not at all. Ensure that the diff value accurately reflects
    the time elapsed since the last update to maintain proper auction house behavior.
