  brief: Checks if the creature has a spell focus ability
  description: This method determines whether a creature possesses a specific spell
    focus ability, which is typically used in conjunction with spell casting or interaction
    with players. The method evaluates the creature's behavior and returns true if
    the creature has the specified spell focus, false otherwise. This functionality
    is commonly used in game mechanics involving NPC interactions, spell casting,
    or special abilities that require specific focus conditions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature has the specified spell focus ability, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (creature->HasSpellFocus(&focusSpell)) {\n    // Do something\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely checks against a specific spell focus type or category,
    and may require the creature to have certain conditions or flags set in order
    to return true. Implementation details may vary based on how spell focus is defined
    within TrinityCore.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may involve checking against
    specific spell focus values that could potentially cause performance issues if
    used frequently. Ensure proper validation of the spell focus parameter before
    calling this method.
