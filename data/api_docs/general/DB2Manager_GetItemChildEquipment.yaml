  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetItemChildEquipment
  signature: const ItemChildEquipmentEntry * DB2Manager::GetItemChildEquipment(uint32
    itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the child equipment entry for a specified item ID from the DB2
    database.
  description: "The GetItemChildEquipment method fetches the ItemChildEquipmentEntry\
    \ associated with the given item identifier from the TrinityCore database. This\
    \ entry typically contains information about how an item relates to its child\
    \ equipment, such as enchantments or\u9644\u5C5E items that are linked to the\
    \ parent item. The method performs a lookup in the loaded DB2 data structures\
    \ and returns a pointer to the corresponding entry if found, or nullptr if no\
    \ matching entry exists. It is commonly used during item processing, particularly\
    \ when handling complex item interactions like those involving gems, enchantments,\
    \ or special effects."
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an ItemChildEquipmentEntry structure if a matching entry is
    found for the given item ID; otherwise, returns nullptr if no such entry exists
    in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const ItemChildEquipmentEntry* childEntry = sDB2Manager->GetItemChildEquipment(12345);\n\
      if (childEntry)\n{\n    // Process the child equipment entry\n    printf(\"\
      Found child equipment for item %u\\n\", childEntry->ItemID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the DB2 data has been properly loaded and initialized.
    The returned pointer is only valid as long as the DB2 manager's internal data
    remains valid and unmodified. It is recommended to check for null before using
    the result.
  warnings: Ensure that the item ID passed into this function corresponds to a valid
    item in the game database, otherwise the method will return nullptr without any
    error indication. Avoid storing the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the
    DB2Manager instance.
