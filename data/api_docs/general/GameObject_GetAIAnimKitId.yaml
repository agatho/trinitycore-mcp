  method: GetAIAnimKitId
  signature: uint16 GameObject::GetAIAnimKitId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the AI animation kit ID associated with the game object.
  description: This method returns the unique identifier for the AI animation kit
    that is assigned to a GameObject. The AI animation kit ID determines how the object's
    animations are handled during gameplay, particularly in relation to AI behavior
    and visual effects. It is typically used by developers working with AI systems
    or animation-related code to access specific animation configurations for game
    objects. This method does not require any parameters and returns a uint16 value
    representing the animation kit ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the unique identifier of the AI animation kit assigned to the
    GameObject, which is used to determine how animations are applied during AI behavior.
    The value is typically a uint16 that corresponds to an entry in the AnimationKit.db2
    file or similar database structure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint16 animKitId = go->GetAIAnimKitId();\nif (animKitId > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Use animKitId to apply specific animations\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the GameObject class and should be used carefully when
    dealing with AI-related code. It's important to note that this value may be zero
    if no animation kit has been assigned to the object, which could indicate a missing
    or default configuration.
  warnings: This method does not perform any validation checks on the returned value.
    If the animation kit ID is 0, it might suggest that the GameObject lacks proper
    AI configuration or that the animation kit hasn't been set up correctly in the
    database.
