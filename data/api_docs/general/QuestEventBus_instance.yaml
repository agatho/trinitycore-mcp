documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the QuestEventBus class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the QuestEventBus
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the quest event bus exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method is used to access the global quest event
    handling system which manages quest-related events such as quest start, quest
    complete, and quest update notifications. The returned instance can be used to
    register event listeners, trigger quest events, or query current quest states
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton QuestEventBus instance. The method will always
    return a valid pointer to the singleton object; it never returns NULL under normal
    circumstances.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the QuestEventBus singleton
    code: 'QuestEventBus* questBus = QuestEventBus::instance();

      // Use questBus to register event handlers or trigger events'
    language: cpp
  - title: Registering a quest event handler
    code: "QuestEventBus* bus = QuestEventBus::instance();\nbus->RegisterHandler(QuestEventType::QUEST_STARTED,\
      \ [](uint32 questId) {\n    // Handle quest start event\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Quest %u started\", questId);\n});"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is created during application
    initialization. The QuestEventBus singleton should be accessed through this method
    rather than creating new instances directly, as it ensures consistent event handling
    across all subsystems.
