  class: ThreatManager
  method: GetThreatListSize
  signature: size_t ThreatManager::GetThreatListSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the size of the threat list managed by the ThreatManager.
  description: The GetThreatListSize method retrieves the number of entries in the
    threat list maintained by the ThreatManager class. This method is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine how many units are currently
    on the threat list for a specific creature or player. The threat list contains
    all entities that have generated threat (aggro) towards the object, and this size
    can be crucial for determining combat behavior, AI decisions, and managing the
    overall threat dynamics within the game world. This method is typically used in
    conjunction with other threat management functions to monitor and control the
    behavior of mobs or players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a size_t value representing the number of entries in the threat
    list. This value indicates how many units are currently generating threat towards
    the object, which can be useful for determining combat state, AI behavior, and
    managing threat distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32_t threatCount = pCreature->GetThreatManager()->GetThreatListSize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and should not cause performance issues when called
    frequently. It is typically used in combat situations where the number of threats
    needs to be monitored for AI decision making.
  warnings: No specific warnings; however, developers should ensure that the ThreatManager
    object is properly initialized before calling this method, as calling it on an
    uninitialized object may lead to undefined behavior.
