  class: Player
  method: setCinematic
  signature: void Player::setCinematic(uint8 cine)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cinematic mode for the player, enabling or disabling cinematic sequences.
  description: The setCinematic method controls whether a player is in cinematic mode,
    which affects how the game handles certain events and interactions. When set to
    0, the player can interact normally with the world; when set to 1, the player
    enters cinematic mode where normal gameplay is suspended. This method is typically
    used during cutscenes or special events to prevent player interaction with the
    environment.
  parameters:
  - name: cine
    description: The cinematic mode value, where 0 disables cinematic mode and 1 enables
      it. Values greater than 1 may cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cinematic Mode Usage
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->setCinematic(1);

      // Player now enters cinematic mode

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling Cinematic Mode
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->setCinematic(0);

      // Player returns to normal gameplay

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the player's state and should be used carefully
    during events. The implementation may involve updating internal flags or state
    variables in the player object, which could impact performance if called frequently.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause players to become stuck in cinematic
    mode or lose control of their character. Always ensure that cinematic mode is
    properly reset after cutscenes are completed.
