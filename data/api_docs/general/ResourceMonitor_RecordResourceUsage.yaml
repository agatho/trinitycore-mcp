  class: ResourceMonitor
  method: RecordResourceUsage
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceUsage(uint32 botGuid, ResourceType
    type, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Records resource usage for a specified bot and resource type.
  description: The RecordResourceUsage method logs resource consumption data for a
    given bot identified by its GUID. It tracks the amount of a specific resource
    type consumed, which is useful for monitoring bot behavior, managing resource
    allocation, and enforcing resource limits within the game environment. This method
    is typically invoked when a bot performs an action that consumes resources such
    as mana, health, or currency.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which resource usage
      is being recorded. Must be a valid GUID representing an existing bot in the
      system.
  - name: type
    description: The type of resource being consumed, represented as a ResourceType
      enum value. Valid values include mana, health, gold, or other game-specific
      resources.
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of the specified resource that was consumed. Must be
      a non-negative integer representing the amount used.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Usage Recording
    code: ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceUsage(12345, ResourceType::MANA, 50);
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording Health Consumption
    code: ResourceMonitor::RecordResourceUsage(67890, ResourceType::HEALTH, 200);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely stores data in an internal tracking system or database
    for later analysis. It may be called frequently during bot operations and should
    ideally have minimal performance impact. Ensure that the bot GUID corresponds
    to a valid active bot before calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid botGuid values might result in undefined
    behavior or errors. Make sure resource types are properly defined and that amounts
    are positive integers to avoid incorrect tracking.
