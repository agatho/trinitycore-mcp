  brief: Processes boss mechanic events triggered by spell casts in advanced AI behavior
    systems
  description: The HandleBossMechanic method manages the execution of specific boss
    mechanics when a creature casts a spell. This method is part of the AdvancedBehaviorManager
    class and handles the logic for processing various boss-specific behaviors, such
    as phase transitions, summoning events, or environmental effects that occur during
    combat. It typically integrates with the core TrinityCore AI system to ensure
    proper timing and coordination of these mechanics within the boss encounter. The
    method expects a valid creature pointer and spell ID to determine which mechanic
    to execute.
  parameters:
  - name: boss
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the boss that triggered
      the mechanic. Must be a valid non-null pointer to a boss creature in combat.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that triggered the boss mechanic.
      This ID determines which specific mechanic logic will be executed by the method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Boss Mechanic Handling
    code: "void MyBossAI::OnSpellCast(Creature* boss, uint32 spellId)\n{\n    if (spellId\
      \ == SPELL_PHASE_SHIFT)\n    {\n        sAdvancedBehaviorManager->HandleBossMechanic(boss,\
      \ spellId);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Boss Mechanic with Conditional Logic
    code: "void AdvancedBossAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat()\
      \ && !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n    {\n        if (uint32 spellId\
      \ = GetNextMechanicSpell())\n        {\n            sAdvancedBehaviorManager->HandleBossMechanic(me,\
      \ spellId);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within AI update loops or spell cast
    handlers. It's designed to be thread-safe and should not block execution for extended
    periods. The implementation relies on a lookup table or switch statement internally
    to map spell IDs to specific mechanic behaviors.
  warnings: Ensure that the boss pointer is valid and the creature is actually in
    combat before calling this method, as invalid pointers can cause crashes. Avoid
    calling this method during critical AI update sections where performance is crucial.
