  method: GenerateObstacleKey
  signature: std::string ObstacleAvoidanceManager::GenerateObstacleKey(const ObstacleInfo
    & obstacle)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a unique string key for an obstacle based on its properties for
    avoidance calculations.
  description: The GenerateObstacleKey method creates a deterministic string identifier
    for a given obstacle by combining relevant properties such as position, size,
    and type. This key is used internally by the ObstacleAvoidanceManager to track
    and differentiate between various obstacles in the navigation system. The generated
    key ensures that identical obstacles produce the same key, which is essential
    for consistent avoidance behavior and caching mechanisms. The method does not
    modify the obstacle itself but constructs a unique representation suitable for
    use as a map key or identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the unique key identifying the obstacle based
    on its properties. This string can be used to uniquely identify the obstacle within
    the avoidance system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ObstacleInfo obstacle;

      // ... populate obstacle with data ...

      std::string key = obstacleAvoidanceManager->GenerateObstacleKey(obstacle);

      // Use key for tracking or caching purposes'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on consistent serialization of obstacle properties to ensure
    deterministic output. Any changes to how obstacle data is serialized may affect
    the generated keys and thus break existing avoidance logic. The implementation
    should be thread-safe if used in multi-threaded contexts.
  warnings: Ensure that obstacle properties used in key generation are stable and
    do not change during the lifetime of an obstacle, as this would result in inconsistent
    keys and potentially broken avoidance behavior.
