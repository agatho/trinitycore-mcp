  brief: Loads UI map quest line data from database into memory for quest tracking
    and display in the user interface.
  description: The LoadUiMapQuestLines method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with quest line information that is used by the user interface to display
    quest progress, objectives, and related quest chains on map interfaces. This method
    typically executes during server startup or database reload operations to ensure
    that all quest-related UI elements are properly initialized. The method retrieves
    data from the database tables containing quest line mappings and processes them
    into a format suitable for fast lookup and rendering in the game client's UI components.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void World::LoadDatabase() {\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadUiMapQuestLines();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server startup or database reload
    operations. It may cause performance overhead on large databases with many quest
    lines. The loaded data is cached in memory for fast access during gameplay.
