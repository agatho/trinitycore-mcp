documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotPriorityManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotPriorityManager class is responsible for
    releasing all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This
    includes cleaning up any internal data structures, priority lists, or references
    to bot-related entities that were managed by this instance. When a BotPriorityManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, this destructor ensures proper
    cleanup to prevent memory leaks and maintain system stability. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations as it is a destructor.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BotPriorityManager
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = new BotPriorityManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // This calls ~BotPriorityManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope
    or is deleted. Developers should not manually call this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. The destruction process is expected to be thread-safe
    if the manager was properly initialized and used in a multi-threaded context.
