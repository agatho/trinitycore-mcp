  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: RecordErrorRecovery
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::RecordErrorRecovery(uint32_t botGuid, const
    std::string & errorType, uint64_t recoveryTime)
documentation:
  brief: Records an error recovery event for a bot, logging the bot's GUID, error
    type, and recovery time.
  description: The RecordErrorRecovery method is used to log information about an
    error that occurred in a bot's operation and how long it took to recover from
    that error. This method is part of the BotPerformanceAnalytics class, which tracks
    various performance metrics related to AI bots in the TrinityCore environment.
    The data recorded includes the unique identifier (GUID) of the affected bot, the
    type of error encountered, and the time taken for recovery in microseconds. This
    functionality supports debugging, performance monitoring, and analytics for bot
    behavior within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that experienced the error.
      This value must be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer representing a bot in the
      TrinityCore system.
  - name: errorType
    description: A string describing the type or category of error that occurred.
      This field should contain a meaningful identifier for the error (e.g., 'MovementFailure',
      'SpellCastTimeout').
  - name: recoveryTime
    description: The time taken to recover from the error, measured in microseconds.
      This value indicates how long the bot took to resume normal operation after
      encountering the issue.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.RecordErrorRecovery(12345, "MovementFailure", 5000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'uint32_t botId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      std::string error = GetLastBotError();

      uint64_t recoveryMs = CalculateRecoveryTime();

      analytics.RecordErrorRecovery(botId, error, recoveryMs * 1000);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the bot AI system when an error
    condition is detected and recovered from. It is recommended to call this method
    only after ensuring that the error has been fully handled and the bot is back
    in a stable state. The recovery time should be measured accurately using high-resolution
    timers for meaningful analytics.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid is valid and corresponds to an actual bot instance;
    otherwise, the recorded data may not be associated with any real entity. Also,
    avoid calling this method too frequently in performance-critical sections as it
    may impact system responsiveness if logging or storage mechanisms are not optimized.
