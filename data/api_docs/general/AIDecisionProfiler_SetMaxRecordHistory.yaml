  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: SetMaxRecordHistory
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::SetMaxRecordHistory(uint32_t maxRecords)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of records to retain in the AI decision profiler's
    history.
  description: The SetMaxRecordHistory method configures the maximum number of historical
    AI decision records that the AIDecisionProfiler will maintain. This limit controls
    memory usage and performance by capping how many past decisions are stored for
    analysis. When the history reaches this limit, older entries are automatically
    removed to make space for new ones. The profiler is typically used for debugging
    and optimizing AI behavior in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation.
  parameters:
  - name: maxRecords
    description: The maximum number of historical records to store. Must be a positive
      integer value. Setting this to zero effectively disables record keeping.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set history limit to 1000 records
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetMaxRecordHistory(1000);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable record history storage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.SetMaxRecordHistory(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal circular buffer used for storing AI decision
    records. Setting a high value may increase memory consumption during extended
    server operation. The change takes effect immediately without requiring additional
    initialization.
