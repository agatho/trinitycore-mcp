  class: RestorationHoTTracker
  method: GetLifebloomTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 RestorationHoTTracker::GetLifebloomTimeRemaining(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the time remaining for a Lifebloom HoT effect on a specified target.
  description: The GetLifebloomTimeRemaining method returns the duration, in milliseconds,
    that remains on the Lifebloom heal-over-time (HoT) effect applied to a specific
    target. This method is typically used by restoration druids to track the status
    of their Lifebloom spell, which provides periodic healing over time. The method
    takes a GUID parameter to identify the target and returns 0 if no active Lifebloom
    effect is found on that target. It is part of the RestorationHoTTracker class,
    which manages tracking of various HoT effects for restoration spells in the game.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit whose Lifebloom time
      remaining is to be retrieved. This value should correspond to a valid GameObject
      or Creature GUID.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the time remaining on the Lifebloom
    HoT effect in milliseconds. If no active Lifebloom effect exists on the specified
    target, the method returns 0.
  examples:
  - title: Check Lifebloom Duration on Target
    code: "Unit* target = ...; // Some target unit\nuint32 timeRemaining = restorationTracker->GetLifebloomTimeRemaining(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue());\n\
      if (timeRemaining > 0)\n{\n    // Lifebloom is active, print remaining time\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Lifebloom has \" << timeRemaining << \"ms remaining\" <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No active Lifebloom on target\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"No active Lifebloom on target\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the GUID provided corresponds to a valid unit in
    the game world. The implementation likely uses internal tracking structures to
    maintain state about active HoT effects, and may involve thread-safe access patterns
    depending on how it's integrated into the TrinityCore architecture.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed to this method is valid and refers to an existing
    unit, otherwise behavior is undefined. This method should only be called from
    contexts where the target unit is guaranteed to exist in the game world.
