api:
  class: PriestAI
  method: IsEmergencyHeal
  signature: bool PriestAI::IsEmergencyHeal(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell ID corresponds to an emergency heal
    spell for the priest AI.
  description: The IsEmergencyHeal method evaluates whether a given spell ID represents
    an emergency healing ability that should be prioritized by the PriestAI during
    combat. This method is typically used in the context of intelligent spell selection
    and targeting logic, where certain healing spells are flagged as emergency measures
    to be cast immediately when a target's health drops below critical thresholds.
    The method checks against predefined emergency heal spell IDs stored within the
    AI's configuration or database. It returns true if the spell ID matches any known
    emergency heal spell, and false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    optimal healing priority during high-pressure combat situations in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the specified spell ID is classified
    as an emergency heal. True indicates that the spell is an emergency heal, while
    false indicates it is not.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (priestAI->IsEmergencyHeal(spellId)) {\n    // Cast this spell immediately\n\
      \    DoCastVictim(emergencySpellId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with healing priority system
    code: "uint32 emergencyHeal = 0;\nfor (auto& spell : emergencyHealsList) {\n \
      \   if (IsEmergencyHeal(spell)) {\n        emergencyHeal = spell;\n        break;\n\
      \    }\n}\nif (emergencyHeal)\n    DoCastVictim(emergencyHeal);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell ID mappings or a predefined list
    of emergency healing spells. The implementation may be optimized for performance
    by using hash tables or precomputed lookup structures rather than linear searches
    through spell databases.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual heal spell in the game's database, otherwise the method will return
    false even if the spell should be considered emergency healing.
