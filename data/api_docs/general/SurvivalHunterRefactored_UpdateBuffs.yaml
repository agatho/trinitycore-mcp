documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states for the survival hunter
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs that are currently applied to the SurvivalHunterRefactored instance.
    This includes checking the validity of existing buffs, applying new buffs based
    on current conditions, and removing expired or invalid buffs from the hunter's
    state. The method ensures that the hunter's buff status remains synchronized with
    game mechanics such as talent effects, item bonuses, and environmental modifiers.
    It typically gets called during combat updates or when buff states need to be
    refreshed in response to specific events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // Update hunter's buffs before each combat\
      \ action\n    hunter.UpdateBuffs();\n    // Proceed with combat logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Buff System
    code: "class CustomBuffSystem\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateHunterBuffs(SurvivalHunterRefactored&\
      \ hunter)\n    {\n        // Pre-update logic\n        hunter.UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \        // Post-update validation\n        ValidateActiveBuffs(hunter);\n \
      \   }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    accurate buff states. It may internally iterate through all active buffs and perform
    validity checks, so performance could be impacted if a large number of buffs are
    active simultaneously.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat or update contexts as it might
    cause unintended behavior with buff expiration timers or state synchronization.
    Avoid calling this method recursively as it may lead to stack overflow or inconsistent
    buff states.
