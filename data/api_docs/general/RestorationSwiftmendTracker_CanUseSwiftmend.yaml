  signature: bool RestorationSwiftmendTracker::CanUseSwiftmend() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a Swiftmend spell can be used by the restoration shaman.
  description: The CanUseSwiftmend method evaluates the current state of the restoration
    shaman to determine if the Swiftmend spell is available for casting. This includes
    checking for valid target conditions, mana availability, and any active cooldowns
    or buffs that might prevent the spell from being cast. The method ensures that
    the shaman's current game state aligns with the requirements for using Swiftmend,
    which is a key healing ability in the restoration specialization.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Swiftmend spell can be used at this time, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether all preconditions for casting Swiftmend are met.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (restorationSwiftmendTracker->CanUseSwiftmend()) {\n    // Proceed with\
      \ casting Swiftmend\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SWIFTMEND, true);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle case where Swiftmend cannot be used\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Swiftmend is not available at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against internal cooldowns, target validity,
    and resource availability. It may also consider the presence of certain auras
    or buffs that affect spell usage.
