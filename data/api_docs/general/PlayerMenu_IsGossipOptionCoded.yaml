documentation:
  brief: Checks if a gossip option is coded with a specific selection value
  description: The IsGossipOptionCoded method determines whether a given gossip selection
    index corresponds to a coded (i.e., scripted) gossip option within the player's
    current gossip menu. This method is typically used during gossip interaction handling
    to distinguish between standard and custom-coded options that trigger specific
    script behaviors. It evaluates the internal gossip menu state and returns true
    if the specified selection has been registered as a coded option, which usually
    implies that a custom script or handler will be invoked when this option is selected
    by the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified gossip selection index corresponds to a coded
    option in the current menu; otherwise returns false. A coded option typically
    indicates that a custom script or handler is associated with that menu entry.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a Gossip Option is Coded
    code: "if (player->PlayerMenu->IsGossipOptionCoded(1))\n{\n    // This gossip\
      \ option has a custom script attached\n    player->PlayerMenu->SendGossipMenu(1001,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Standard gossip option\n    player->PlayerMenu->SendGossipMenu(1002,\
      \ npc->GetGUID());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore gossip system
    to route player selections to appropriate scripted handlers. The selection parameter
    typically corresponds to the index of the option in the gossip menu (starting
    from 0). It's important to note that this check should be performed after the
    gossip menu has been properly initialized and populated with options.
  warnings: Ensure that the player's current gossip menu is valid before calling this
    method. Calling IsGossipOptionCoded without a proper active gossip session may
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Also, be aware that coded options
    are usually managed through scripts and not directly by the core code.
