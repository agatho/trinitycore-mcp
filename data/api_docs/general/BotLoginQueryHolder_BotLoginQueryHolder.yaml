documentation:
  brief: Initializes a bot login query holder with account and character identifiers
  description: The BotLoginQueryHolder constructor initializes a query holder object
    used for retrieving and managing bot-related login data in TrinityCore. This method
    sets up internal state to associate a specific account ID with a character GUID,
    enabling subsequent database queries for bot authentication and session management.
    The initialization process typically occurs during the bot login sequence when
    the server needs to validate credentials and prepare necessary data structures
    for the bot's session. This constructor is part of the broader bot management
    system that handles automated player character interactions within the World of
    Warcraft emulation environment.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account associated with the bot. Must
      be a positive integer representing a valid account in the database.
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier of the bot character. Must correspond
      to an existing character entry in the database with proper authentication permissions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Login Initialization
    code: 'BotLoginQueryHolder queryHolder(12345, 67890);

      // Initializes a query holder for account ID 12345 and character GUID 67890'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in Bot Login Context
    code: "void HandleBotLogin(int accountId, int guid) {\n    BotLoginQueryHolder\
      \ holder(accountId, guid);\n    // Proceed with database queries using the initialized\
      \ holder\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform immediate database operations. It merely
    initializes internal data structures that will be used by subsequent query methods.
    The actual database access occurs when calling methods like GetQueries() or executing
    the prepared statements.
  warnings: Ensure that both accountId and guid parameters correspond to valid entries
    in the database; invalid identifiers may cause runtime errors during subsequent
    query execution. This constructor should only be called within a valid authentication
    context where account and character data are confirmed to exist.
