  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: GetDecisionSuccessRate
  signature: float AdaptiveBehaviorManager::GetDecisionSuccessRate(const std::string
    & decision) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the success rate percentage for a specified decision made by the
    adaptive behavior manager.
  description: The GetDecisionSuccessRate method returns a floating-point value representing
    the historical success rate of a specific decision made by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
    This metric is typically used in AI-driven decision-making systems to evaluate
    how often a particular behavioral choice has led to successful outcomes. The method
    takes a string identifier for the decision and returns a value between 0.0 and
    1.0, where 0.0 indicates no success and 1.0 indicates perfect success. This information
    can be crucial for adjusting AI behavior dynamically based on performance data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the success rate of the
    specified decision. A value of 0.0 means no successes, while 1.0 means all attempts
    were successful. Returns 0.0 if the decision is not found or has no historical
    data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float successRate = behaviorManager->GetDecisionSuccessRate(\"attack_target\"\
      );\nif (successRate > 0.7f) {\n    // Proceed with high confidence in attack\
      \ decision\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Success Rate for Behavior Adjustment
    code: "float rate = behaviorManager->GetDecisionSuccessRate(\"cast_spell\");\n\
      if (rate < 0.3f) {\n    // Consider switching to alternative behavior due to\
      \ low success\n    behaviorManager->SetBehaviorMode(BehaviorMode::DEFENSIVE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using historical tracking of decision outcomes
    and may cache results for performance. The accuracy of the returned value depends
    on sufficient historical data being available for the specified decision. For
    new or rarely used decisions, the success rate might be 0.0 until enough data
    has been collected.
  warnings: The method assumes that decisions are consistently identified by their
    string names across different sessions. If decision names change or are misspelled,
    this could lead to incorrect results. Additionally, very low sample sizes may
    produce misleadingly high or low success rates.
