  class: RogueBaselineRotation
  method: ExecuteRotation
  signature: bool RogueBaselineRotation::ExecuteRotation(int * bot, int * target,
    BaselineRotationManager & manager)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline rogue rotation logic for a bot character.
  description: The ExecuteRotation method performs the core decision-making process
    for a rogue bot's combat behavior. It evaluates the current state of the bot and
    target, then determines and executes appropriate actions such as applying poisons,
    performing stealth-based attacks, or using abilities like Eviscerate or Sinister
    Strike. This method integrates with the BaselineRotationManager to manage rotation
    state and timing, ensuring optimal resource usage and damage output. The method
    returns true if an action was successfully executed, or false if no valid action
    could be determined or performed.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character's data structure, containing current
      health, mana, position, and status effects.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target character's data structure, including health,
      position, and combat state information.
  - name: manager
    description: Reference to the BaselineRotationManager that tracks rotation state,
      cooldowns, and timing for action execution.
  returns: Returns true if a rotation action was successfully executed, false otherwise.
    A return of false typically indicates either no valid actions available or an
    inability to perform any action due to resource constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rotation execution
    code: "int botData[10];\nint targetData[10];\nBaselineRotationManager manager;\n\
      RogueBaselineRotation rotation;\nbool result = rotation.ExecuteRotation(botData,\
      \ targetData, manager);\nif (result) {\n    // Action was executed successfully\n\
      } else {\n    // No action taken\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat loop
    code: "void CombatLoop() {\n    while (IsInCombat()) {\n        int bot[10];\n\
      \        int target[10];\n        BaselineRotationManager manager;\n       \
      \ RogueBaselineRotation rotation;\n        \n        if (!rotation.ExecuteRotation(bot,\
      \ target, manager)) {\n            // Handle case where no action was taken\n\
      \            Wait(100); // Brief pause before next check\n        }\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the state information provided through the
    bot and target pointers. The implementation assumes that these structures are
    properly initialized with current character data. The BaselineRotationManager
    must be properly configured to track cooldowns and rotation timing for optimal
    performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target data structures are valid and up-to-date
    before calling this method, as invalid data can lead to undefined behavior or
    incorrect action selection. This method may block or delay execution if it needs
    to wait for cooldowns or resource availability.
