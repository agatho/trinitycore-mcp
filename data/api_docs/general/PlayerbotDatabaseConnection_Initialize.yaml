  class: PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
  method: Initialize
  signature: bool PlayerbotDatabaseConnection::Initialize(const std::string & connectionInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the playerbot database connection using the provided connection
    information.
  description: The Initialize method sets up and establishes a connection to the playerbot
    database using the specified connection details. This method is typically called
    during the initialization phase of the playerbot system to ensure that all database
    operations can be performed correctly. It validates the connection string format
    and attempts to establish a stable database connection, returning true upon successful
    initialization or false if any errors occur during the process.
  parameters:
  - name: connectionInfo
    description: 'A string containing the database connection parameters including
      host, port, username, password, and database name. Format typically follows:
      ''host:port;user;password;database'' or similar depending on the underlying
      database driver.'
  returns: Returns true if the database connection was successfully initialized and
    established, false otherwise. A return value of false indicates that the connection
    failed due to invalid parameters, network issues, authentication failure, or other
    database access problems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Database Initialization
    code: "PlayerbotDatabaseConnection db;\nstd::string connInfo = \"localhost:3306;playerbot_user;playerbot_pass;playerbot_db\"\
      ;\nbool success = db.Initialize(connInfo);\nif (success) {\n    // Database\
      \ connection established successfully\n    printf(\"Playerbot database initialized\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle initialization failure\n    printf(\"\
      Failed to initialize playerbot database\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the lifetime of a PlayerbotDatabaseConnection
    instance. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or connection leaks.
    The method performs blocking operations and should not be called from time-critical
    threads. Connection information must be properly formatted to avoid initialization
    failures.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or malformed connection strings as
    it will likely fail and return false without providing detailed error information.
    Ensure that the database server is accessible and the provided credentials have
    appropriate permissions before calling this method.
