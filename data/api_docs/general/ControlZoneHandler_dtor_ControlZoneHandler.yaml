  signature: void ControlZoneHandler::~ControlZoneHandler()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a ControlZoneHandler instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~ControlZoneHandler destructor is responsible for cleaning up the
    resources allocated by the ControlZoneHandler class. This method ensures that
    any dynamically allocated memory, active references, or internal data structures
    are properly released when an instance of ControlZoneHandler goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    this handler likely manages control zones or areas within the game world that
    affect player behavior or game mechanics. The destructor typically performs cleanup
    tasks such as unregistering from event systems, releasing references to game objects,
    or clearing internal caches related to zone management.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'ControlZoneHandler* handler = new ControlZoneHandler();

      // ... use the handler ...

      delete handler; // Triggers ~ControlZoneHandler()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually invoke destructors
    unless implementing custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore, this destructor
    may be part of a larger system managing game zones and their interactions with
    players.
