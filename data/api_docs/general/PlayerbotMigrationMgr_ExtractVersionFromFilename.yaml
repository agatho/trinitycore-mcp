    & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Extracts version information from a playerbot migration filename.
  description: This method parses a given filename string to extract and return the
    version identifier embedded within it. It is typically used in the context of
    playerbot migration management where files are named with version tags to track
    different migration states or updates. The method assumes that the version information
    follows a specific naming convention, such as containing a version number (e.g.,
    'v1.2.3') or a semantic versioning pattern within the filename. This functionality
    supports automated migration processes by identifying which version of playerbot
    data or configuration is represented by a particular file.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string representing the extracted version from the filename. If
    no valid version is found, it may return an empty string or a default placeholder
    depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with standard versioned filename
    code: 'PlayerbotMigrationMgr migrationMgr;

      std::string filename = "playerbot_migration_v2.1.0.sql";

      std::string version = migrationMgr.ExtractVersionFromFilename(filename);

      // Returns: "v2.1.0"'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on pattern matching or string parsing logic to identify
    version strings within the filename. Developers should ensure that filenames follow
    a consistent naming convention for reliable extraction. The exact regex or parsing
    strategy is not specified but must be robust enough to handle various version
    formats (e.g., 'v1.0', '1.2.3', 'beta-2').
  warnings: If the filename does not contain recognizable version information, the
    method may return an empty string or unexpected results. Ensure that input filenames
    conform to expected patterns before calling this method.
