  class: SocialEventBus
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void SocialEventBus::UpdateMetrics(std::chrono::microseconds processingTime)
documentation:
  brief: Updates internal metrics with the provided processing time for social event
    handling.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recording and updating
    performance-related statistics within the SocialEventBus class. It accepts a std::chrono::microseconds
    parameter representing the time taken to process a social event, which is then
    used to maintain aggregate metrics such as average processing time, total events
    processed, and other performance indicators. This method is typically called after
    completing the handling of a social event to ensure accurate tracking of system
    performance. The updated metrics may be used for debugging, performance optimization,
    or monitoring purposes within the TrinityCore server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: processingTime
    description: The time duration in microseconds that was spent processing a single
      social event. This value should be a positive duration representing actual processing
      time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void HandleSocialEvent() {\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // ... perform social event logic ...\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto processingTime = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end\
      \ - start);\n    SocialEventBus::Instance()->UpdateMetrics(processingTime);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called from within the event handling loop of the social
    system. It's important to ensure that processingTime accurately reflects only
    the time spent in actual event processing, excluding any waiting or blocking operations.
    The method may be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment, but this
    should be verified through source code inspection.
  warnings: Ensure that processingTime is always a valid positive duration; negative
    values could lead to incorrect metric calculations. If this method is called too
    frequently without proper batching, it might introduce performance overhead due
    to frequent updates of internal counters or statistical data structures.
