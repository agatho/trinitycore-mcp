  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ProfessionManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ProfessionManager
    class, providing global access to a single, shared instance of the profession
    management system. This method ensures that only one instance of ProfessionManager
    exists throughout the TrinityCore server lifecycle, allowing all subsystems to
    access and modify player profession data consistently. The returned pointer is
    guaranteed to be valid during server operation and should not be deleted by callers.
    This implementation is thread-safe and designed for efficient repeated calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of ProfessionManager. The method never
    returns NULL during normal server operation, as the singleton instance is initialized
    during server startup.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Profession Manager Singleton
    code: 'ProfessionManager* pm = ProfessionManager::instance();

      // Use pm to access profession-related functionality

      uint32 skillLevel = pm->GetPlayerSkillLevel(playerGuid, SKILL_ENGINERING);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Singleton in a Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnPlayerLearnProfession(Player* player, uint32 skillId)\n{\n    ProfessionManager*\
      \ pm = ProfessionManager::instance();\n    if (pm)\n    {\n        pm->AddPlayerSkill(player->GetGUID(),\
      \ skillId, 1);\n        // Additional profession logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern with lazy initialization.
    The ProfessionManager instance is typically created during server startup and
    destroyed at shutdown. Multiple calls to this method will return identical pointer
    values, ensuring consistency across the codebase.
  warnings: While this is a thread-safe singleton implementation, developers should
    be cautious about using it in multi-threaded contexts where race conditions might
    occur with mutable state. The returned instance should never be deleted or managed
    by the caller.
