  class: DeathKnightAI
  method: HandleAoERotation
  signature: bool DeathKnightAI::HandleAoERotation(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the Death Knight's AoE rotation against a specified target.
  description: The HandleAoERotation method is responsible for managing the AI behavior
    of a Death Knight when engaging multiple enemies in an area-of-effect (AoE) combat
    scenario. It evaluates the current state of the Death Knight and its surrounding
    environment to determine the most effective sequence of abilities to use against
    the target and nearby enemies. This method typically involves checking for available
    spells such as Howling Blast, Frost Fever, Blood Plague, and other AoE abilities,
    while also considering resource management like Runic Power and the presence of
    beneficial auras or debuffs. The method returns true if the rotation was successfully
    executed or false if no suitable action could be taken.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: A pointer to the Unit object representing the primary target for
      the AoE rotation. This unit must be valid and within combat range for the method
      to function properly.
  returns: Returns true if the Death Knight successfully executed an AoE rotation
    against the target, false otherwise. The return value indicates whether a valid
    action was performed or if no suitable ability could be used.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        if (!HandleAoERotation(target))\n        {\n            // Fallback\
      \ to single-target rotation\n            DoMeleeAttackIfReady();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional AoE Rotation
    code: "if (me->GetMap()->IsDungeon() && me->GetThreatManager().GetTotalThreat()\
      \ > 10000)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = SelectTarget(SELECT_TARGET_TOPAGGRO))\n\
      \    {\n        if (HandleAoERotation(target))\n        {\n            // Successfully\
      \ initiated AoE rotation\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Death Knight AI is properly initialized and
    has access to necessary spell data. The implementation may vary depending on the
    specific subclass or specialization of the Death Knight. It is recommended to
    check for valid target and combat readiness before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling HandleAoERotation without verifying that the target is within
    range or that there are multiple enemies nearby may result in ineffective behavior
    or errors. Ensure that the AI context is appropriate for AoE usage, especially
    in single-target scenarios where it might be detrimental.
