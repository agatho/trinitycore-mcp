  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void SurvivalHunterRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the survival hunter's AoE rotation logic against a specified target.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for a survival
    hunter's area-of-effect combat rotation. This method evaluates the current combat
    situation, selects appropriate abilities based on threat levels and cooldowns,
    and applies them to the provided target. It is designed to handle multiple enemy
    targets efficiently while maintaining optimal resource management and damage output
    in group or raid environments. The method assumes that the hunter has valid targeting
    information and sufficient resources to execute the rotation.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      within the combat environment. This parameter determines which enemy unit the
      rotation logic will prioritize for AoE attacks.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'int targetIndex = 1;

      player->GetAI()->ExecuteAoERotation(&targetIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Executing Rotation with Dynamic Targeting
    code: 'int* currentTarget = &player->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();

      player->GetAI()->ExecuteAoERotation(currentTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the hunter is in combat and has valid
    targeting information. The implementation assumes that all necessary cooldowns
    and resource checks have been performed prior to calling this function.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper target validation may result in undefined
    behavior or invalid actions being executed. Ensure that the target pointer points
    to a valid enemy unit before invoking this method.
