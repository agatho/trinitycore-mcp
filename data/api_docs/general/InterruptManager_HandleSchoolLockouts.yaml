  signature: void InterruptManager::HandleSchoolLockouts(uint32 schoolMask, uint32
    duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies school lockout effects to affected units based on the provided school
    mask and duration.
  description: The HandleSchoolLockouts method is responsible for managing magical
    school lockout mechanics within the TrinityCore framework. It processes a bitmask
    representing different magic schools (such as arcane, fire, frost, etc.) and applies
    corresponding lockout durations to units that are affected by these spells or
    abilities. This mechanism prevents players or creatures from casting spells from
    specific schools for a defined period after being hit by an interrupting effect.
    The method typically interacts with the unit's spell and aura systems to enforce
    cooldowns and prevent spell casting during the lockout period.
  parameters:
  - name: schoolMask
    description: A bitmask representing the magic schools affected by the lockout.
      Each bit corresponds to a specific school (e.g., arcane = 1, fire = 2, nature
      = 4, etc.). Multiple schools can be combined using bitwise OR operations.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the lockout effect should
      remain active. This determines how long affected units are prevented from casting
      spells from the specified schools.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic School Lockout Application
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      interruptMgr.HandleSchoolLockouts(SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FIRE | SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_FROST,
      3000); // Lock out fire and frost schools for 3 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Applying Lockout to All Schools
    code: 'InterruptManager interruptMgr;

      interruptMgr.HandleSchoolLockouts(SPELL_SCHOOL_MASK_ALL, 5000); // Lock out
      all schools for 5 seconds'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a spell or ability interrupts another
    spell's casting, causing a temporary lockout of specific magic schools. The implementation
    likely interacts with the unit's existing aura system to track and apply these
    lockouts. It may also be used in conjunction with other interrupt-related methods
    like HandleInterrupts() or ApplySpellMod().
  warnings: Ensure that the schoolMask parameter is properly validated before use,
    as invalid bits could lead to unexpected behavior. The duration should be carefully
    chosen to avoid excessive gameplay disruption or exploit opportunities.
