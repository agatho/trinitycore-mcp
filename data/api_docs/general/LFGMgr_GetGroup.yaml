  class: LFGMgr
  method: GetGroup
  signature: int LFGMgr::GetGroup(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG group identifier associated with the specified player GUID
  description: The GetGroup method is used to retrieve the Looking For Group (LFG)
    group identifier that a player belongs to. This method allows the system to determine
    which LFG group a specific player is currently part of, enabling proper group
    management and coordination within the TrinityCore framework. The method typically
    operates on player GUIDs to map them to their respective LFG groups. It's commonly
    used in LFG-related systems to check group membership or to facilitate group operations
    such as joining, leaving, or disbanding groups.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose LFG group is being
      retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns the LFG group identifier (int) if the player is currently in an
    LFG group, or -1 if the player is not in any LFG group. A return value of 0 may
    also indicate no group membership depending on internal implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Player Group Membership
    code: "int groupId = sLFGMgr->GetGroup(playerGuid);\nif (groupId != -1) {\n  \
      \  // Player is in an LFG group\n    printf(\"Player belongs to LFG group %d\\\
      n\", groupId);\n} else {\n    // Player is not in any LFG group\n    printf(\"\
      Player is not in an LFG group\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GetGroup to Validate Group Participation
    code: "void CheckAndProcessLFGMembership(uint64 playerGuid) {\n    int groupId\
      \ = sLFGMgr->GetGroup(playerGuid);\n    if (groupId > 0) {\n        // Player\
      \ is in a valid LFG group, proceed with group operations\n        ProcessPlayerGroupActions(playerGuid,\
      \ groupId);\n    } else if (groupId == -1) {\n        // Player not in any group,\
      \ initiate new group creation or join process\n        StartNewLFGSearch(playerGuid);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within LFG subsystems and may involve internal
    lookups using player GUIDs. The implementation likely relies on internal data
    structures that map player GUIDs to group identifiers for efficient retrieval.
    Performance considerations should be taken into account when calling this method
    frequently during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure the provided GUID is valid and corresponds to an actual player
    in the system, as invalid GUIDs may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect return
    values. The method assumes that LFG systems are properly initialized and active.
