  signature: std::string PlayerbotMigrationMgr::GetMigrationPath()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the file path used for player bot migration data storage.
  description: The GetMigrationPath method returns the full filesystem path where
    player bot migration data is stored. This path is typically constructed based
    on the server's configuration settings and the current expansion or version being
    used. The returned string represents a directory location that contains migration-related
    files such as character data, bot configurations, and state information needed
    for migrating player bots between different versions or environments. This method
    is essential for managing player bot data persistence across server updates or
    migrations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the absolute filesystem path where player bot
    migration data is stored. The path typically includes the server's data directory,
    expansion-specific folders, and migration subdirectories.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::string migrationPath = sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->GetMigrationPath();

      TC_LOG_INFO("playerbots", "Migration path: {}", migrationPath);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on server configuration settings and may return different
    paths depending on the active expansion or game version. The returned path should
    be validated for existence before attempting to read/write migration files.
