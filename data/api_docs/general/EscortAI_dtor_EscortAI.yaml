documentation:
  brief: Destroys an EscortAI instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The EscortAI destructor is called when an EscortAI object is being
    destroyed. This method ensures proper cleanup of any resources allocated during
    the lifetime of the escort AI, including releasing references to waypoints, stopping
    ongoing escort behaviors, and notifying the game world that the escort has ended.
    It is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted. The destructor does not take any parameters and performs
    no return operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Default destruction of EscortAI
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    EscortAI* escort = new EscortAI();\n    //\
      \ ... perform escort logic ...\n    delete escort; // This calls ~EscortAI()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is deleted. Developers should not manually call this destructor
    unless implementing custom memory management strategies.
