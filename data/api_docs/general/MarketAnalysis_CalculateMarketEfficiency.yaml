documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the market efficiency ratio for a specified item based
    on supply, demand, and price fluctuations.
  description: The CalculateMarketEfficiency method computes a normalized efficiency
    value for a given item within the game's economy system. This value reflects how
    well an item's current market price aligns with its expected or ideal price based
    on supply and demand dynamics. The method analyzes historical trading data, current
    auction house listings, and player behavior to determine this ratio. It is typically
    used by in-game systems or external tools to evaluate market health, identify
    overpriced or underpriced items, and assist players in making informed economic
    decisions. The result is a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0
    represents optimal market efficiency and values closer to 0.0 indicate significant
    inefficiencies.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which market efficiency is
      being calculated. Must correspond to a valid item in the game's database.
  returns: A float value representing the market efficiency ratio for the specified
    item, ranging from 0.0 (completely inefficient) to 1.0 (perfectly efficient).
    Returns 0.0 if the item has no market data or is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nfloat efficiency = analyzer.CalculateMarketEfficiency(12345);\n\
      if (efficiency > 0.8f) {\n    // Item is considered well-priced in the market\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "MarketAnalysis analyzer;\nuint32 itemId = 98765;\nfloat efficiency = analyzer.CalculateMarketEfficiency(itemId);\n\
      if (efficiency >= 0.0f && efficiency <= 1.0f) {\n    // Valid efficiency value\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Market Efficiency for item \" << itemId << \": \" << efficiency\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle invalid or error condition\n    std::cerr\
      \ << \"Failed to calculate market efficiency for item \" << itemId << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries and may involve caching mechanisms
    to improve performance. It is recommended to cache results for frequently accessed
    items to avoid repeated calculations. The exact algorithm used for efficiency
    calculation is not publicly documented but may involve statistical analysis of
    price trends, volume data, and inventory levels.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid itemId (e.g., one that does not exist
    in the game database) may result in undefined behavior or return values outside
    the expected range. Always validate item IDs before calling this method if dealing
    with user input.
