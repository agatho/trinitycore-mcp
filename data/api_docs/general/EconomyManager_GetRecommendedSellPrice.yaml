  signature: uint32 EconomyManager::GetRecommendedSellPrice(uint32 itemId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the recommended sell price for a specified item based
    on its market value and game economy mechanics.
  description: The GetRecommendedSellPrice method determines the appropriate sell
    price for a given item ID by analyzing various in-game economic factors such as
    item rarity, market demand, and vendor pricing strategies. This method is typically
    used by NPCs or auction systems to dynamically set sell prices that reflect current
    game conditions. The returned value represents the base gold amount that players
    should receive when selling an item under normal circumstances. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is purely informational, making it safe for
    repeated calls without side effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the recommended sell price in copper
    coins (100 copper = 1 silver, 100 silver = 1 gold). If the item ID is invalid
    or not found in the economy database, it returns 0, indicating no valid pricing
    information exists for that item.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 sellPrice = economyManager->GetRecommendedSellPrice(18739);\nif\
      \ (sellPrice > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Recommended sell price: %u copper\\n\", sellPrice);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Item Selling Logic
    code: "void Player::SellItem(Item* item)\n{\n    uint32 recommendedPrice = economyManager->GetRecommendedSellPrice(item->GetEntry());\n\
      \    if (recommendedPrice > 0)\n    {\n        // Process sale at recommended\
      \ price\n        AddMoney(recommendedPrice);\n        item->RemoveFromInventory();\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Handle invalid item case\n        SendSellError(SELL_ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the economy database configuration and may return different
    values depending on server settings, expansion content, or custom modifications.
    The returned price is calculated using internal algorithms that consider item
    level, quality, and market trends rather than fixed static values. For performance
    reasons, it's recommended to cache results when frequently querying prices for
    the same items.
  warnings: Do not assume all returned values are valid for immediate use in transactions
    without checking for zero or negative values. Some items might legitimately return
    0 if they're not meant to be sold or if their pricing data is missing from the
    economy system.
