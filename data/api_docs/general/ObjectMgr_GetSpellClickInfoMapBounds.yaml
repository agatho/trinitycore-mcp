  class: ObjectMgr
  method: GetSpellClickInfoMapBounds
  signature: int ObjectMgr::GetSpellClickInfoMapBounds(uint32 creature_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of spell click info entries associated with a specified
    creature ID.
  description: The GetSpellClickInfoMapBounds method retrieves the count of spell
    click information entries stored for a given creature ID within the ObjectMgr's
    internal data structures. Spell click info is used in World of Warcraft to define
    interactions between creatures and spells, typically when a player clicks on a
    creature to trigger a specific spell or action. This method is commonly used during
    server initialization or runtime to determine how many spell click events are
    registered for a particular creature type. The returned value represents the size
    of the associated container or map entry for that creature ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of spell click info entries found for
    the specified creature ID. Returns 0 if no entries exist for the given creature
    ID, or if the creature ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 creatureId = 12345;\nint count = sObjectMgr->GetSpellClickInfoMapBounds(creatureId);\n\
      if (count > 0)\n{\n    // Process spell click info entries\n    printf(\"Creature\
      \ %u has %d spell click events\\n\", creatureId, count);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on internal data structures managed by ObjectMgr and
    is typically called during server startup or when validating creature configurations.
    It does not perform any database queries directly but accesses pre-loaded spell
    click information from memory.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing creature template in the database, otherwise the result will be
    0 without indicating an error condition.
