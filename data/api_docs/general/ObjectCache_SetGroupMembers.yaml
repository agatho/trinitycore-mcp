  class: ObjectCache
  method: SetGroupMembers
  signature: void ObjectCache::SetGroupMembers(const int & members)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of members in a group within the object cache.
  description: The SetGroupMembers method updates the cached count of group members
    for a specific object. This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    server implementation to maintain consistency between the actual group composition
    and the cached data. It ensures that group-related operations, such as loot distribution
    or raid management, can reference accurate member counts without repeatedly querying
    the database. The method does not validate the input value but assumes it represents
    a valid group size.
  parameters:
  - name: members
    description: An integer reference representing the number of members in the group.
      This value should be non-negative and typically corresponds to the current size
      of the group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Group Members Count
    code: 'ObjectCache* cache = ObjectCache::GetCache();

      int groupSize = 5;

      cache->SetGroupMembers(groupSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an internal caching mechanism and should only be called
    when the actual group composition changes. Improper usage may lead to inconsistencies
    in group-based gameplay mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'members' parameter accurately reflects the current group
    size, as incorrect values can cause issues with group-based systems like loot
    rules or raid coordination.
