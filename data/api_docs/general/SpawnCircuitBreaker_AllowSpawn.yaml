  class: SpawnCircuitBreaker
  method: AllowSpawn
  signature: bool SpawnCircuitBreaker::AllowSpawn()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a new spawn is allowed based on circuit breaker logic.
  description: The AllowSpawn method evaluates the current state of the SpawnCircuitBreaker
    to decide if a new creature or game object spawn should be permitted. This mechanism
    prevents excessive spawning that could lead to performance degradation or game
    instability. The method typically checks internal counters, time thresholds, and
    other limiting factors to make its decision. It is commonly used in AI systems
    and spawn managers to regulate entity creation rates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spawn is allowed according to circuit breaker rules;
    otherwise returns false if spawning should be blocked.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spawn Logic
    code: "if (spawnCircuitBreaker.AllowSpawn()) {\n    // Proceed with spawning logic\n\
      \    SpawnCreature();\n} else {\n    // Skip spawning to respect circuit breaker\
      \ limits\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"spawn\", \"Spawn blocked by circuit breaker.\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Behavior
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    bool UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (spawnCircuitBreaker.AllowSpawn()) {\n      \
      \      // Spawn additional units or objects\n            DoSpawn();\n      \
      \  }\n        return true;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before attempting to spawn any new entities.
    It's designed to be lightweight and fast, as it may be invoked frequently during
    active gameplay. The circuit breaker logic often includes cooldowns, maximum spawn
    limits, and time-based restrictions.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to uncontrolled spawning which may
    cause server lag or crashes. Ensure that all spawn points properly check this
    before creating new entities.
