  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: SetExplorationStrategy
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::SetExplorationStrategy(const std::string & strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the exploration strategy for a behavior adaptation instance.
  description: The SetExplorationStrategy method configures the exploration behavior
    of a BehaviorAdaptation object by assigning a specific exploration strategy identified
    by a string name. This method is typically used in AI systems to define how an
    NPC or creature should explore its environment, such as using different pathfinding
    or movement patterns. The strategy parameter determines the underlying algorithm
    or approach that will be employed during exploration tasks. This configuration
    affects the behavior of the AI agent and can influence how it navigates and interacts
    with the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: strategy
    description: A string identifier specifying the exploration strategy to be applied.
      Valid values depend on the implemented strategies within the BehaviorAdaptation
      system, such as 'random', 'grid', or 'pathfinding'.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Random Exploration Strategy
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = new BehaviorAdaptation();

      behavior->SetExplorationStrategy("random");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configuring Grid-Based Exploration
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* ai = GetAI();

      ai->SetExplorationStrategy("grid");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate whether the provided strategy string is valid.
    It's assumed that the system will handle invalid strategies gracefully or throw
    an exception if required. The actual behavior of exploration may depend on other
    AI components and configuration settings.
  warnings: Ensure that the strategy string passed to this method corresponds to a
    registered exploration strategy within the BehaviorAdaptation framework. Passing
    an unrecognized strategy may result in undefined behavior or default fallback
    behavior.
