  class: QuestManager
  method: ScanItemQuests
  signature: void QuestManager::ScanItemQuests()
documentation:
  brief: Scans all items in the player's inventory for quest-related item requirements
    and updates quest progress accordingly.
  description: The ScanItemQuests method iterates through all items currently equipped
    or in the player's inventory to check if any items have quest-related requirements
    or are required for active quests. It evaluates item flags, quest associations,
    and completion status to update the player's quest log and progress. This method
    is typically invoked automatically during quest updates or when items are added/removed
    from the inventory. The scanning process ensures that quest objectives tied to
    specific items are properly tracked and completed as needed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: player->GetQuestManager()->ScanItemQuests();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the core quest system and should
    not typically be invoked manually. It performs a full inventory scan which may
    have performance implications for players with large inventories. The method respects
    item binding states and quest restrictions.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of normal quest progression cycles
    can lead to unexpected behavior or quest state inconsistencies. Avoid invoking
    it during active quest events or while processing other quest-related operations.
