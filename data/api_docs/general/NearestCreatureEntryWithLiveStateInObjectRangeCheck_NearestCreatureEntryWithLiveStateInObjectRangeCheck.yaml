  signature: void NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck::NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck(const
    NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck
    class with values from another instance.
  description: This constructor performs a copy operation for the NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck
    class, initializing a new object with the state and data from an existing instance.
    It is typically used in scenarios where multiple instances of this check class
    are needed, such as when implementing AI behavior or object scanning logic within
    the TrinityCore framework. The class likely serves to find the nearest creature
    entry that matches specific live state criteria within a given range of an object.
    This constructor ensures proper initialization of internal member variables and
    maintains consistency between copied instances.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The source instance from which to copy the state and data for initializing
      this new instance.
  returns: null

    code: 'NearestCreatureEntryWithLiveStateInObjectRangeCheck original(100, 200,
      true);

  notes: This is a standard copy constructor implementation. It's important to note
    that the class likely involves complex internal state management related to creature
    scanning, range calculations, and live state checks in the game world. The performance
    of this operation depends on how efficiently the internal data structures are
    copied.
