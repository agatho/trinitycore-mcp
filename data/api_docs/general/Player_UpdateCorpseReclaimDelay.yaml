  brief: Updates the delay timer for corpse reclaiming after player death
  description: The UpdateCorpseReclaimDelay method manages the cooldown period during
    which a player's corpse can be reclaimed by their faction. This method is typically
    called when a player dies or when corpse reclaim status changes, ensuring that
    the game enforces proper timing between death and corpse retrieval. The delay
    prevents immediate corpse looting and ensures balanced gameplay mechanics for
    both PvP and PvE scenarios.

  - title: Basic Usage in Death Handler
    code: "void Player::HandleDeath()\n{\n    // ... death logic ...\n    UpdateCorpseReclaimDelay();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's corpse data structure and
    faction-specific reclaim timers. It may be automatically invoked during player
    death events, but can also be manually called when corpse status changes.
