  signature: float SocialStrategy::GetRelevance(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the relevance score of a social strategy for a given
    bot AI instance.
  description: The GetRelevance method evaluates how pertinent or effective a specific
    social strategy is for the current bot AI context. It takes into account various
    factors such as player relationships, interaction history, and game state to determine
    a float value representing the strategy's relevance. This score is used by the
    AI system to prioritize which social behaviors or actions should be executed next.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is typically called during decision-making
    processes within the bot's behavior tree or strategy selection logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no relevance (strategy
    should not be considered) and 1.0 indicates maximum relevance (strategy is highly
    applicable). Values in between represent varying degrees of applicability based
    on contextual factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI Decision Making
    code: "float relevance = strategy->GetRelevance(ai);\nif (relevance > 0.7f) {\n\
      \    // Execute the social strategy\n    ai->ExecuteStrategy(strategy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Multiple Social Strategies
    code: "SocialStrategy* bestStrategy = nullptr;\nfloat bestRelevance = 0.0f;\n\n\
      for (auto& strategy : availableStrategies) {\n    float relevance = strategy->GetRelevance(ai);\n\
      \    if (relevance > bestRelevance) {\n        bestRelevance = relevance;\n\
      \        bestStrategy = strategy;\n    }\n}\n\nif (bestStrategy && bestRelevance\
      \ > 0.5f) {\n    ai->ExecuteStrategy(bestStrategy);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method relies on internal AI state and may vary based on dynamic conditions
    such as player proximity, faction status, or quest progress. It is recommended
    to cache the result if the method is called multiple times within a single decision
    cycle to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: This method should not be used in performance-critical sections without
    prior profiling, as it may involve complex computations depending on the AI implementation.
    Avoid calling this method excessively during high-frequency update loops.
