  signature: void PathfindingAdapter::ClearAllCache()
documentation:
  brief: Clears all cached pathfinding data within the PathfindingAdapter instance.
  description: The ClearAllCache method invalidates and removes all stored pathfinding
    cache entries from the PathfindingAdapter. This operation ensures that subsequent
    path requests will recalculate paths from scratch, bypassing any previously cached
    results. It is typically invoked when the game environment changes significantly,
    such as after map modifications, object spawns, or when the internal state of
    navigation meshes requires a complete refresh. The method does not take any parameters
    and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PathfindingAdapter adapter;

      adapter.ClearAllCache();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used judiciously as clearing the cache can lead to
    performance overhead during path calculations. It is recommended to call this
    function only when necessary, such as after major map updates or when pathfinding
    behavior becomes inconsistent.
