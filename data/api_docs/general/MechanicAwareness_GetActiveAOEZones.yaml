documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active area-of-effect zones in the current environment
  description: The GetActiveAOEZones method retrieves the number of currently active
    area-of-effect zones that are affecting the object. This is commonly used in AI
    behavior to determine environmental hazards or spell effects that may influence
    movement, targeting, or action selection. The method provides a simple integer
    count which can be used to make decisions about whether to avoid certain areas,
    prepare for incoming damage, or adjust combat strategies. It's particularly relevant
    for NPC behavior systems and player-controlled character awareness of dangerous
    zones.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of active area-of-effect zones currently
    present in the object's vicinity. Returns zero if no AOE zones are active.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check for active AOE zones
    code: "if (mechanicAwareness->GetActiveAOEZones() > 0)\n{\n    // Avoid moving\
      \ into dangerous areas\n    unit->MoveTowards(unit->GetPosition().m_positionX\
      \ + 5.0f, unit->GetPosition().m_positionY + 5.0f, unit->GetPosition().m_positionZ);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using AOE zone count for AI decision making
    code: "int aoeCount = mechanicAwareness->GetActiveAOEZones();\nif (aoeCount >=\
      \ 3)\n{\n    // High danger - seek cover or flee\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_PASSIVE);\n\
      }\nelse if (aoeCount >= 1)\n{\n    // Moderate danger - prepare defensive actions\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(unit, SPELL_SHIELD_OF_FAITH, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other mechanic awareness
    functions to build a complete picture of the environment. The returned count may
    change dynamically as AOE effects are applied or removed from the game world.
    Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight as it's designed for frequent
    polling in AI decision-making loops.
  warnings: Be aware that the count returned may include zones from multiple sources
    (spells, environmental effects, etc.) and does not distinguish between different
    types of AOE effects. If precise zone identification is needed, additional methods
    or tracking mechanisms should be implemented.
