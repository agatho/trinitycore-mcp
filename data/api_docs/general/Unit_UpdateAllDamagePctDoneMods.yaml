  brief: Updates all percentage-based damage done modifiers for the unit.
  description: The UpdateAllDamagePctDoneMods method recalculates and applies all
    percentage-based damage modifiers that affect the unit's outgoing damage. This
    includes buffs, debuffs, auras, and other game effects that modify damage percentages.
    The method ensures that the unit's damage output reflects all currently active
    percentage-based modifications. It is typically called when damage modifiers change
    or when the unit's state needs to be refreshed for accurate damage calculations.

  notes: This method should be called after applying or removing percentage-based
    damage modifiers to ensure accurate damage calculations. It may trigger recalculations
    of the unit's damage stats and could potentially impact performance if called
    frequently during combat.
