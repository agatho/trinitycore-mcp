  class: BotProfiler
  method: ExportToCSV
  signature: void BotProfiler::ExportToCSV(const ProfilingSession * session, std::ofstream
    & file)
documentation:
  brief: Exports profiling session data to a CSV file format for analysis and reporting.
  description: The ExportToCSV method serializes profiling data from a given ProfilingSession
    into a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. This functionality is typically used
    by the BotProfiler class to generate detailed performance reports that can be
    analyzed using spreadsheet software or imported into data visualization tools.
    The method writes header information followed by row-wise data entries, ensuring
    each entry corresponds to a specific bot or profiling metric within the session.
    It assumes the provided file stream is already opened and valid for writing operations.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the ProfilingSession object containing the data to be
      exported. Must not be null.
  - name: file
    description: Reference to an open std::ofstream object where the CSV formatted
      data will be written. The file must already be opened in write mode.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotProfiler profiler;\nProfilingSession* session = profiler.CreateNewSession();\n\
      // ... populate session with profiling data ...\nstd::ofstream outFile(\"bot_profile_data.csv\"\
      );\nif (outFile.is_open()) {\n    profiler.ExportToCSV(session, outFile);\n\
      \    outFile.close();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not handle file locking or concurrent access; it is assumed
    that only one thread will write to the output file. Performance may degrade if
    large profiling sessions are exported without buffering.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided file stream is properly opened before calling
    this method, otherwise the operation will fail silently or cause undefined behavior.
    Do not pass a null pointer for session parameter as it will likely result in a
    crash.
