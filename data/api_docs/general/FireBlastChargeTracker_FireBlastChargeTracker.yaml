documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FireBlastChargeTracker class.
  description: The FireBlastChargeTracker constructor initializes the internal state
    of the charge tracking system for the Fire Blast ability. This method sets up
    default values for tracking fire blast charges, including initializing charge
    counts, cooldown timers, and any relevant flags or state variables. The tracker
    is typically used in conjunction with spell systems to manage the number of available
    fire blast charges a player can use within a given time window. It ensures that
    the system correctly handles charge accumulation, usage, and reset conditions
    according to game mechanics.

  - title: Creating a FireBlastChargeTracker instance
    code: 'FireBlastChargeTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track fire blast charges'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called when creating a new instance of the
    FireBlastChargeTracker. It does not perform any validation or setup beyond initializing
    internal state variables. The actual tracking logic for fire blast charges is
    handled by other methods in the class such as AddCharge(), UseCharge(), and IsReady().
