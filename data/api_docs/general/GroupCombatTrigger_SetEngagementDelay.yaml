  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: SetEngagementDelay
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::SetEngagementDelay(uint32 delayMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the engagement delay for group combat triggers in milliseconds.
  description: The SetEngagementDelay method configures the time delay, specified
    in milliseconds, that must pass before a group combat trigger engages enemies
    after being activated. This delay is used to prevent immediate combat activation
    and allows for smoother transitions or scripted events. The method directly modifies
    an internal timer value within the GroupCombatTrigger instance, affecting when
    the trigger will begin its combat behavior. This functionality is particularly
    useful in scripted encounters where timing control is necessary for proper event
    flow.
  parameters:
  - name: delayMs
    description: The delay time in milliseconds to set for engagement. Valid values
      are non-negative integers representing the time before combat begins after trigger
      activation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* trigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      trigger->SetEngagementDelay(3000); // Delay for 3 seconds before engaging'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Delay Adjustment
    code: "void SetupCombatTrigger(GroupCombatTrigger* trigger, uint32 baseDelay)\n\
      {\n    uint32 adjustedDelay = baseDelay + urand(0, 1000); // Add random delay\
      \ up to 1 second\n    trigger->SetEngagementDelay(adjustedDelay);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate the input value for delayMs; it's expected
    that callers provide appropriate values. The internal timer is likely reset upon
    calling this method, so subsequent calls will overwrite previous settings. This
    implementation may be used in conjunction with other group AI behaviors to coordinate
    complex encounters.
