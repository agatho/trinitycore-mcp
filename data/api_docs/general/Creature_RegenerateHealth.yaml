documentation:
  brief: Regenerates the creature's health over time based on its regen rates and
    current state.
  description: The RegenerateHealth method is responsible for restoring a creature's
    health points according to its predefined regeneration rates. This function typically
    gets called periodically by the game engine as part of the creature's update cycle.
    It checks whether the creature is capable of regenerating health (e.g., not in
    combat, not under certain debuffs) and applies the appropriate healing amount
    based on the creature's base regen rate and any modifiers. The method ensures
    that health does not exceed the creature's maximum health value. This functionality
    is crucial for maintaining game balance and realism in creature behavior.

    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      creature->RegenerateHealth();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the core's update loop at
    regular intervals. Developers should not call this method directly unless implementing
    custom behavior or debugging. The regeneration process respects creature states
    such as combat, fear, and other conditions that may inhibit health recovery.
