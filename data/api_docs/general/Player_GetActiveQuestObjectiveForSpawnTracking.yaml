  signature: const int * Player::GetActiveQuestObjectiveForSpawnTracking(uint32 spawnTrackingId)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the active quest objective count for spawn tracking by ID.
  description: This method retrieves a pointer to an integer representing the current
    progress of an active quest objective that is being tracked for spawn events.
    It is used internally by the TrinityCore framework to manage quest state related
    to creature or game object spawns. The returned pointer may be null if no matching
    active quest objective exists for the given spawn tracking ID. This method does
    not modify any internal player state and is safe to call during quest progression
    checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to an integer representing the current progress value of
    the active quest objective, or nullptr if no such objective exists for the specified
    spawn tracking ID.
  examples:
  - title: Check Spawn Tracking Quest Progress
    code: "int32 progress = *player->GetActiveQuestObjectiveForSpawnTracking(12345);\n\
      if (progress >= 0)\n{\n    // Quest objective is active and has progressed\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Spawn tracking quest progress: %d\", progress);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spawn tracking systems
    for quests that require players to interact with specific creatures or objects.
    The returned integer represents the current count towards completing a quest objective,
    such as killing N enemies or collecting M items.
  warnings: The returned pointer must be checked for null before dereferencing to
    avoid segmentation faults. This method should not be used to modify quest progress
    directly; it is intended for read-only access to quest state information.
