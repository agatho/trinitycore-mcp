  method: CollectDatabaseMetrics
  signature: void ResourceMonitor::CollectDatabaseMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Collects and logs database performance metrics for monitoring resource usage.
  description: The CollectDatabaseMetrics method gathers various database-related
    statistics such as query execution times, connection counts, and overall database
    load. This information is typically used by the ResourceMonitor class to track
    system performance and identify potential bottlenecks in database operations.
    The collected data may be stored internally for later analysis or sent to logging
    systems for real-time monitoring. This method is usually invoked periodically
    by the server's resource management subsystem to maintain up-to-date performance
    metrics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Resource Monitoring Loop
    code: "void ResourceMonitor::Update()\n{\n    // Periodically collect database\
      \ metrics\n    CollectDatabaseMetrics();\n    \n    // Other monitoring tasks...\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve blocking database calls to fetch current statistics,
    which could impact performance if called too frequently. It's recommended to call
    this method at reasonable intervals (e.g., every few seconds) rather than on every
    game tick. The collected metrics are typically not returned directly but stored
    internally for later retrieval or logging.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently can cause performance degradation due
    to database overhead. Ensure that the monitoring interval is tuned appropriately
    based on server load and required granularity of metrics.
