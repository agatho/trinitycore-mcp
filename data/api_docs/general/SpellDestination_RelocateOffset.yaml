  class: SpellDestination
  method: RelocateOffset
  signature: void SpellDestination::RelocateOffset(const int & offset)
documentation:
  brief: Relocates the spell destination by applying a specified offset to its current
    position.
  description: The RelocateOffset method adjusts the coordinates of a SpellDestination
    object by adding the provided offset value to its existing position. This method
    is typically used in spell casting mechanics where precise targeting or positioning
    adjustments are required. The offset parameter likely represents a displacement
    vector that modifies the destination's X, Y, and Z coordinates. This functionality
    is essential for spells that need to target areas relative to a base point or
    for adjusting spell effects based on caster orientation or other game mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: offset
    description: An integer value representing the offset to be applied to the current
      position of the spell destination. This value is typically used to adjust the
      X, Y, and Z coordinates of the target location.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Spell Target Adjustment
    code: 'SpellDestination dest;

      // Assume dest has been initialized with a valid position

      int offset = 5;

      dest.RelocateOffset(offset);

      // The destination position is now adjusted by 5 units in the relevant coordinate
      system'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Spell Target Based on Caster Orientation
    code: 'SpellDestination targetPos = GetCaster()->GetSpellDestination();

      int directionOffset = CalculateDirectionalOffset(GetCaster()->GetOrientation());

      targetPos.RelocateOffset(directionOffset);

      // Adjusts spell target position based on caster''s facing direction'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies the internal coordinates of the SpellDestination
    object directly. The offset value may be interpreted differently depending on
    the spell's context and whether it's being used for area targeting, linear projection,
    or other mechanics. Developers should ensure that the offset values are within
    reasonable bounds to prevent unexpected behavior in spell targeting.
  warnings: The method modifies the destination object in-place, so any references
    to this object after calling RelocateOffset will reflect the updated position.
    Care should be taken when using this method in multi-threaded contexts or when
    the same SpellDestination object is shared between multiple systems.
