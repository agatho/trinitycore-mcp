  signature: bool VMapManager2::processCommand(char * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a command string for VMapManager2 functionality
  description: The processCommand method handles command-line input for the VMapManager2
    system, which manages virtual maps and their associated data in the TrinityCore
    emulator. This method typically parses incoming commands related to map loading,
    unloading, or management operations. It is used primarily by the server's console
    interface or administrative tools to control virtual map behavior during runtime.
    The method returns true if the command was successfully processed, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: A null-terminated character string containing the command to be processed.
      This typically includes a command name followed by optional parameters separated
      by spaces.
  returns: Returns true if the command was successfully parsed and executed, false
    if the command is invalid or could not be processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Command Processing
    code: "VMapManager2* vmapMgr = VMapManager2::instance();\nbool result = vmapMgr->processCommand(\"\
      loadmap 1234\");\nif (result) {\n    printf(\"Map loading command processed\
      \ successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"Failed to process map loading\
      \ command\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Command Processing with Error Handling
    code: "VMapManager2* vmapMgr = VMapManager2::instance();\nconst char* command\
      \ = \"unloadmap 5678\";\nbool success = vmapMgr->processCommand(const_cast<char*>(command));\n\
      if (!success) {\n    // Log error or handle failed command\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to process command: %s\", command);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the server's console handler or administrative
    interfaces. It should be used with caution as incorrect commands may lead to map
    loading/unloading issues. The method assumes that the VMapManager2 instance has
    been properly initialized before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with malformed command strings may cause undefined
    behavior or system instability. Ensure all commands are properly validated before
    being passed to this function. This method should not be called from within critical
    sections where map loading/unloading operations are in progress.
