documentation:
  brief: Moves a CollectionMgr object to another CollectionMgr instance, transferring
    ownership of its resources.
  description: The CollectionMgr move constructor transfers the internal state and
    resources from one CollectionMgr instance to another. This operation is typically
    used when moving objects between scopes or containers, allowing efficient resource
    management without deep copying. The source object becomes invalid after the move
    operation and should not be used. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft
    emulation, this method supports efficient handling of player collection data such
    as achievements, toys, mounts, and other collectible items that are managed through
    the CollectionMgr system.

  examples:
  - title: Move Constructing a CollectionMgr
    code: 'CollectionMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with data ...

      CollectionMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor in action

      // sourceMgr is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Move Constructor in Container
    code: 'std::vector<CollectionMgr> collectionVector;

      CollectionMgr mgr1;

      // ... populate mgr1 ...

      collectionVector.push_back(std::move(mgr1)); // Move into vector

      // mgr1 is now invalid, but vector contains the moved data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. It's designed for efficient
    resource transfer rather than duplication. After moving, the source object should
    not be accessed or used in any way that assumes it still holds valid data.
  warnings: Attempting to use the source CollectionMgr after a move operation results
    in undefined behavior. Always ensure that the moved-from object is not referenced
    again. This constructor is typically invoked implicitly during move operations,
    so explicit usage is rare but possible when needed for specific container management
    scenarios.
