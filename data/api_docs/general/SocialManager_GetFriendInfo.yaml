  class: SocialManager
  method: GetFriendInfo
  signature: FriendInfo SocialManager::GetFriendInfo(int playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves detailed information about a friend from the social manager's friend
    list using the player's GUID.
  description: The GetFriendInfo method retrieves comprehensive information about
    a specific friend in the social manager's friend list. It takes a player GUID
    as input and returns a FriendInfo structure containing details such as the friend's
    name, online status, last seen time, and other relevant social data. This method
    is typically used within the context of World of Warcraft's social system to display
    or manipulate friend-related data in the user interface or game logic. The method
    assumes that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid friend in the player's social
    list, and will return an empty or default FriendInfo structure if no such friend
    exists.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose friend information
      is being retrieved. This should be a valid player GUID within the game's social
      system.
  returns: Returns a FriendInfo structure containing detailed information about the
    specified friend, including name, online status, last seen time, and other social
    attributes. If no friend with the given GUID exists in the social list, an empty
    or default FriendInfo structure is returned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Friend Information
    code: "FriendInfo friend = socialManager.GetFriendInfo(123456);\nif (!friend.name.empty())\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Friend: \" << friend.name << \" (Online: \" << friend.isOnline\
      \ << \")\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Friend Online Status
    code: "uint32_t friendGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nFriendInfo info\
      \ = socialManager.GetFriendInfo(friendGuid);\nif (info.isOnline) {\n    // Handle\
      \ online friend logic\n    SendChatMessage(\"Friend is online!\");\n} else {\n\
      \    // Handle offline friend logic\n    SendChatMessage(\"Friend is offline.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the social manager's internal data structures and
    assumes that the player GUID provided corresponds to a valid friend in the current
    player's social list. The FriendInfo structure returned may contain default or
    empty values if the friend does not exist. This method should be used carefully
    in performance-critical sections of code as it may involve lookups in the social
    database.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter is valid and corresponds to an actual
    friend before calling this method, otherwise the returned FriendInfo will be empty
    or default. Be cautious when using this method in high-frequency loops as it may
    cause performance issues if not properly cached or optimized.
