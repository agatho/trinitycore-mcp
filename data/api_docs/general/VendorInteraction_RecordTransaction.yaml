  class: VendorInteraction
  method: RecordTransaction
  signature: void VendorInteraction::RecordTransaction(VendorAction type, uint64 value)
documentation:
  brief: Records a vendor transaction with the specified action type and value.
  description: The RecordTransaction method logs a vendor interaction event within
    the TrinityCore framework. It takes a VendorAction enum indicating the type of
    transaction (such as buying, selling, or refunding) and a uint64 value representing
    the amount or identifier associated with the transaction. This method is typically
    used to maintain audit trails for player-vendor interactions in World of Warcraft.
    The method does not return any value but updates internal transaction records
    that may be used for logging, accounting, or anti-cheat purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The VendorAction enum specifying the type of vendor interaction (e.g.,
      buy, sell, refund). Valid values are defined within the VendorAction enumeration.
  - name: value
    description: A 64-bit unsigned integer representing the transaction value. This
      could be gold amount, item entry ID, or other relevant identifier depending
      on the action type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Record a purchase transaction
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.RecordTransaction(VendorAction::BUY, 1000); // Records a purchase of
      1000 gold worth of items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Record a refund transaction
    code: 'VendorInteraction vendor;

      vendor.RecordTransaction(VendorAction::REFUND, 5000); // Records a refund of
      5000 gold'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures used for transaction
    logging and may be called automatically by the core vendor system when players
    interact with NPCs. Developers should ensure proper handling of the VendorAction
    enum values to avoid incorrect logging.
