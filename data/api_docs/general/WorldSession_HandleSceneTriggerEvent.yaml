documentation:
  brief: Processes incoming scene trigger events from the client, handling cinematic
    sequences and visual effects.
  description: The HandleSceneTriggerEvent method is responsible for processing scene
    trigger events sent by the client in World of Warcraft. These events typically
    correspond to cinematic sequences, quest cutscenes, or other visual effects that
    are triggered during gameplay. The method receives a SceneTriggerEvent packet
    containing information about which scene was triggered and any associated data.
    It then dispatches the appropriate response or action based on the scene trigger,
    potentially updating player state, triggering related game events, or managing
    visual effects. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining the game's narrative
    flow and visual storytelling elements.

  - title: Basic Scene Trigger Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSceneTriggerEvent(WorldPackets::Scenes::SceneTriggerEvent\
      \ & sceneTriggerEvent)\n{\n    // Process the scene trigger event\n    if (sceneTriggerEvent.SceneId)\n\
      \    {\n        // Trigger associated cinematic or effect\n        Player* player\
      \ = GetPlayer();\n        if (player)\n        {\n            player->SendSceneStart(sceneTriggerEvent.SceneId);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main packet handling loop when a
    SceneTriggerEvent packet is received. The scene ID contained in the packet should
    be validated against known scenes to prevent exploitation. Consider performance
    implications when processing large numbers of scene triggers simultaneously.
  warnings: Improper handling of scene triggers can lead to client desynchronization
    or visual glitches. Ensure all scene IDs are properly validated and that appropriate
    permissions checks are performed before executing any scene-related actions.
