  signature: Item * RestStrategy::FindFood(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Searches for and returns a food item in the bot's inventory that can be used
    for resting.
  description: The FindFood method is responsible for identifying a suitable food
    item within the bot's inventory that can be consumed to restore health or mana
    during rest periods. This method is typically invoked by the RestStrategy class
    when determining whether the bot has adequate sustenance before entering a resting
    state. It evaluates available food items based on criteria such as type, quality,
    and effectiveness for the specific bot's needs. The method prioritizes finding
    consumable items that provide the most benefit for the character's current status
    and level. If no suitable food item is found, it returns nullptr to indicate that
    the bot should either find food elsewhere or proceed without resting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an Item object representing the identified food item
    that can be used for resting, or nullptr if no appropriate food item is available
    in the bot's inventory.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in rest strategy
    code: "Item* food = ai->GetBot()->GetRestStrategy()->FindFood(ai);\nif (food)\n\
      {\n    // Use the found food item\n    ai->UseItem(food);\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ No food available, handle accordingly\n    ai->TellMaster(\"No food available\
      \ for rest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making process during resting states.
    It assumes that the bot's inventory has already been checked for items and that
    the item list is accessible through the BotAI context. The implementation likely
    considers factors such as food type (consumable vs. potion), cooldowns, and character-specific
    requirements like dietary restrictions or preferences.
  warnings: The method may return nullptr if no appropriate food is found, which could
    lead to unexpected behavior if not properly handled by calling code. It's important
    to validate the returned pointer before attempting to use it. Additionally, this
    method should only be called when the bot is in a state where resting is possible
    and beneficial.
