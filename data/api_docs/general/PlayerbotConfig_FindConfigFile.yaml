documentation:
  brief: Searches for and returns the path to the playerbot configuration file.
  description: The FindConfigFile method is responsible for locating the appropriate
    playerbot configuration file within the TrinityCore system. It searches through
    predefined directories and returns the full path to the configuration file if
    found, or an empty string if not found. This method is typically used during the
    initialization phase of playerbot behavior to ensure that the correct configuration
    settings are loaded. The search mechanism may consider various factors such as
    server type, playerbot version, or environment variables to determine the most
    appropriate configuration file to use.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the full path to the playerbot configuration file
    if found, or an empty string if no valid configuration file could be located in
    the expected directories.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of FindConfigFile
    code: "PlayerbotConfig config;\nstd::string configFile = config.FindConfigFile();\n\
      if (!configFile.empty()) {\n    std::cout << \"Configuration file found at:\
      \ \" << configFile << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No configuration\
      \ file found.\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method likely performs a recursive search through standard TrinityCore
    directories such as config/, etc/, or data/ folders. It may also check for environment
    variables or command-line arguments that could influence the configuration file
    location. This method is typically called during server startup or when initializing
    playerbot behavior modules.
  warnings: This method does not validate whether the returned file path actually
    contains valid configuration data - it only locates the file. If no configuration
    file is found, an empty string is returned which should be checked by calling
    code to avoid attempting to load invalid data.
