documentation:
  brief: Loads class-specific spell interrupt data from the database into memory for
    use during gameplay.
  description: The LoadClassSpells method initializes and populates internal data
    structures with spell interrupt information specific to each player class. This
    method is typically called during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that class-based spell interruption mechanics are properly configured.
    It retrieves data from the database tables containing spell interrupt definitions
    and caches them for fast lookup during combat and spell casting events. The loaded
    data determines which spells can interrupt others based on class restrictions
    and gameplay balance requirements.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'InterruptDatabase* interruptDb = new InterruptDatabase();

      interruptDb->LoadClassSpells(); // Loads all class spell interrupts'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and valid. The loaded data is typically used by the combat system to determine
    spell interruption rules during active gameplay sessions.
