documentation:
  brief: Creates a unique stat priority key based on class and specialization identifiers.
  description: The MakeStatPriorityKey method generates a uint16 identifier that uniquely
    represents a combination of player class and specialization. This key is used
    internally by the EquipmentManager to determine optimal stat priorities for gear
    assignment and itemization. The method combines the class ID and spec ID into
    a single 16-bit value, with the class ID occupying the upper 8 bits and the spec
    ID in the lower 8 bits. This allows for efficient lookup and management of stat
    priority configurations across different character classes and their specializations
    within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint16 value representing the combined class and specialization identifiers,
    where the upper byte contains the class ID and the lower byte contains the spec
    ID. This key can be used to index into stat priority tables or configurations
    specific to each class/spec combination.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a Stat Priority Key for Warrior Protection
    code: 'EquipmentManager manager;

      uint16 key = manager.MakeStatPriorityKey(1, 2); // Warrior (classId=1), Protection
      spec (specId=2)

      // Result: key = 0x0102

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes valid class and specialization IDs are provided. The implementation
    uses bit manipulation to pack the two 8-bit values into a single 16-bit value,
    which is efficient for memory usage and lookup operations in the equipment management
    system.
