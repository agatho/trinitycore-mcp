  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: UpdateEnhanced
  signature: AIUpdateResult EnhancedBotAI::UpdateEnhanced(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the enhanced bot AI logic and returns the result of the update operation.
  description: The UpdateEnhanced method is responsible for executing the core artificial
    intelligence logic for an enhanced bot within the TrinityCore framework. This
    method processes the bot's current state, evaluates actions based on game conditions,
    and updates its behavior accordingly. It typically runs during each AI tick and
    handles decision-making, movement, combat behavior, and interaction with the game
    world. The method takes a time delta parameter to ensure proper timing of AI actions
    and returns an AIUpdateResult indicating success or failure of the update process.
  parameters: []
  returns: AIUpdateResult enum value indicating the outcome of the AI update operation.
    Possible values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes depending on
    implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void Bot::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_botAI)\n    {\n        AIUpdateResult\
      \ result = m_botAI->UpdateEnhanced(diff);\n        // Handle result if needed\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the main AI update loop and should be
    invoked regularly to maintain bot behavior. The implementation may vary depending
    on specific bot types and their enhanced features. Performance considerations
    include avoiding heavy computations within this method to prevent frame rate drops.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from game logic without proper synchronization,
    as it may modify internal bot state. Ensure that the AI system is properly initialized
    before calling this method.
