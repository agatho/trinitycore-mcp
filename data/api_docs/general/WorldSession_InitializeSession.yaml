  method: InitializeSession
  signature: void WorldSession::InitializeSession()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WorldSession object with default values and prepares it for
    handling client connections.
  description: The InitializeSession method sets up a WorldSession instance with initial
    state values, including resetting session-specific data structures, initializing
    connection-related flags, and preparing internal buffers for processing incoming
    packets. This method is typically called during the creation or reinitialization
    of a session to ensure that all session variables are in a consistent starting
    state before the session begins handling game communication. It ensures that the
    session is ready to process authentication requests, player data, and other network
    messages from the client.

  - title: Basic Session Initialization
    code: 'WorldSession* session = new WorldSession();

      session->InitializeSession();

      // Session is now ready to handle client communication'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called immediately after creating a new WorldSession
    instance or when resetting an existing session. It does not perform any network
    I/O operations but prepares internal state for subsequent operations.
