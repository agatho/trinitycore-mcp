  method: GetActiveNonPlayersCount
  signature: size_t Map::GetActiveNonPlayersCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of active non-player entities in the map.
  description: This method retrieves the number of active non-player objects (NPCs,
    creaturess) present in the current map instance. It is commonly used to monitor
    the population of non-player characters within a specific zone or instance. The
    method provides a snapshot of the current state of non-player entities, which
    can be useful for game mechanics such as quest tracking, instance management,
    and population control. This count includes all active creatures that are currently
    spawned in the map, excluding player characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Represents the total number of active non-player creatures currently present
    in the map instance. The value is a size_t integer indicating the count of these
    entities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Map* map = GetMap();

      size_t nonPlayerCount = map->GetActiveNonPlayersCount();

      std::cout << "Active non-player creatures: " << nonPlayerCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related functions
    to monitor instance population. Performance considerations include the fact that
    this method may involve iterating through all active creatures in the map, which
    could impact performance if many creatures are present. Thread safety depends
    on the implementation of the map's internal locking mechanism.
  warnings: The returned count may not reflect the actual number of creatures currently
    in the world if the map is actively spawning or despawning creatures. Care should
    be taken when relying on this value for game logic that depends on precise creature
    counts.
