  signature: bool Player::HasQuestForGO(int32 goId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the player has a quest associated with a specific game object.
  description: The HasQuestForGO method determines whether the player has any active
    quests that are linked to a specific game object ID. This is commonly used in
    quest scripting and game object interaction logic to verify if a player can interact
    with a particular game object based on their current quest status. The method
    typically checks against the player's quest log and related quest objectives to
    determine if there is a matching quest for the specified game object ID.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has a quest associated with the specified game
    object ID, false otherwise. This indicates that the player either has an active
    quest that requires interaction with the game object or has completed a quest
    that involves the game object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Check
    code: "if (player->HasQuestForGO(12345)) {\n    // Player has a quest related\
      \ to game object 12345\n}\nelse {\n    // No quest found for game object 12345\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    like GetQuestForGO or HasQuestForGO. Performance considerations include checking
    against the player's current quest log, which may involve database queries or
    cached data structures depending on implementation. Thread safety is generally
    not an issue since this method operates on the player's local data.
  warnings: This method does not verify if the player can interact with the game object
    based on quest requirements; it only checks if a quest exists for that specific
    game object ID. The method may return false even when the player has completed
    a quest related to the game object but is no longer active in their quest log.
