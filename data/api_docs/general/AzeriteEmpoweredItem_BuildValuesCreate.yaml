  class: AzeriteEmpoweredItem
  method: BuildValuesCreate
  signature: void AzeriteEmpoweredItem::BuildValuesCreate(int * data, int flags, const
    int * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Populates the provided data array with Azerite empowered item creation values
    for network transmission.
  description: The BuildValuesCreate method is responsible for constructing the data
    required to create an Azerite empowered item in the game world. It fills a provided
    integer array with the necessary field values that represent the item's state
    and properties when being sent to clients. This method is typically invoked during
    the initialization or spawning of Azerite items, ensuring that all relevant information
    about the item's Azerite powers, levels, and other attributes are correctly serialized
    for network transmission. The method operates on the internal data structure of
    the AzeriteEmpoweredItem class and uses the provided flags and target parameters
    to determine how the values should be formatted and written into the data array.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an integer array where the constructed creation values
      will be written. This array must be pre-allocated with sufficient space to hold
      all required field values for the Azerite item.
  - name: flags
    description: Integer flags that control how the data should be processed and formatted.
      These flags likely determine which fields are included or how specific values
      are encoded in the output array.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to a constant integer array that may serve as a reference
      or template for constructing the creation values. This parameter could contain
      default values or field offsets used during data construction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of BuildValuesCreate
    code: 'AzeriteEmpoweredItem item;

      int data[100];

      int flags = 0x01;

      const int* target = nullptr;

      item.BuildValuesCreate(data, flags, target);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal serialization mechanism for Azerite empowered
    items in TrinityCore. Developers should ensure that the 'data' array has adequate
    size to prevent buffer overflows. The exact field layout and meaning of values
    in the data array depend on the specific implementation details of the Azerite
    system within the core.
  warnings: Incorrectly sized 'data' arrays or improper handling of the 'flags' parameter
    may result in corrupted network packets or client-side errors. This method should
    only be called when the AzeriteEmpoweredItem is in a valid state for creation,
    and the target array should not be modified during execution.
