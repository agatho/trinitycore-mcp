  class: GameEventMgr
  method: hasCreatureActiveEventExcept
  signature: bool GameEventMgr::hasCreatureActiveEventExcept(int creature_guid, uint16
    event_id)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a creature has an active game event running, excluding a specified
    event ID.
  description: The hasCreatureActiveEventExcept method determines whether a specific
    creature is currently involved in any active game event, with the exception of
    a given event ID. This functionality is commonly used in TrinityCore's GameEvent
    system to manage creature behavior during seasonal or holiday events. The method
    evaluates the creature's current event state and returns true if at least one
    event is active for the creature, excluding the specified event ID. It helps prevent
    conflicts when multiple overlapping events might affect the same creature, allowing
    developers to selectively exclude certain events from consideration.
  parameters:
  - name: creature_guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the creature to check for active
      events. This should be a valid creature GUID within the game world.
  - name: event_id
    description: The event ID to exclude from the check. If any other events are active
      for this creature, the method will return true regardless of this exclusion.
  returns: Returns true if the creature has at least one active game event running,
    excluding the specified event ID. Returns false if no events are active or if
    only the excluded event is active.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a creature has any active events except event 10
    code: "if (sGameEventMgr->hasCreatureActiveEventExcept(12345, 10)) {\n    // Creature\
      \ has an active event other than event 10\n    // Perform some action based\
      \ on this condition\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use in creature AI to determine event-based behavior
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override {\n        if (sGameEventMgr->hasCreatureActiveEventExcept(me->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ 5)) {\n            // Creature is affected by an event other than event 5\n\
      \            // Execute event-specific logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on TrinityCore's internal game event tracking system.
    The implementation likely uses a map or set structure to store active events per
    creature. Performance is generally good for typical usage, but frequent calls
    with many creatures may impact performance in high-traffic areas.
  warnings: Ensure that the creature_guid parameter refers to an existing creature
    in the world; otherwise behavior is undefined. Be cautious when using this method
    in loops or high-frequency update contexts as it may involve map lookups.
