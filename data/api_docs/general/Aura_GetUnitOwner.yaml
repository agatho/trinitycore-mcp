  method: GetUnitOwner
  signature: Unit * Aura::GetUnitOwner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit object that owns this aura.
  description: The GetUnitOwner method retrieves the Unit instance that is the owner
    or caster of the aura. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, auras are
    applied to units (such as players or creatures) and often originate from another
    unit (like a spell cast by a player). This method allows access to the original
    caster or owner of the aura, which can be crucial for determining effects, calculating
    damage, or managing aura behavior. The returned Unit pointer may be null if the
    aura has no valid owner, such as in certain temporary or system-generated auras.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object that owns this aura, or nullptr if there is
    no valid owner.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check aura owner
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    Unit* owner = aura->GetUnitOwner();\n\
      \    if (owner)\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Aura owned by: %s\", owner->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using owner to apply conditional logic
    code: "if (Aura* aura = target->GetAura(98765))\n{\n    Unit* owner = aura->GetUnitOwner();\n\
      \    if (owner && owner->IsPlayer())\n    {\n        // Apply special behavior\
      \ for player-owned auras\n        DoSomethingSpecial();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Unit pointer should be checked for null before use, as some
    auras might not have an associated owner. This method is commonly used in spell
    and aura handling logic to determine the source of effects.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned Unit pointer without checking for
    null; accessing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware that
    the ownership relationship may change or become invalid during certain gameplay
    events such as unit death or removal from the world.
