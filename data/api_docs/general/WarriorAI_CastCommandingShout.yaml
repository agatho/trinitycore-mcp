documentation:
  brief: Casts the Commanding Shout spell on the warrior's target.
  description: The CastCommandingShout method is responsible for executing the Commanding
    Shout ability within the WarriorAI class. This ability provides a buff to nearby
    allies, increasing their attack power and critical strike chance. The method typically
    checks if the spell is available (not on cooldown), if the warrior has sufficient
    mana, and if the target is valid before casting. It's part of the warrior's core
    combat abilities and is often used in group scenarios to enhance team performance.
    The spell affects nearby friendly units within a specified range.

  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n \
      \   {\n        // Cast Commanding Shout when appropriate\n        if (me->HasAura(SPELL_COMMANDING_SHOUT))\n\
      \            CastCommandingShout();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's spell casting logic and may include
    checks for line of sight, target validity, and spell cooldowns. It should be called
    only when the warrior is in combat and has a valid target or when the buff is
    needed for group performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the warrior has enough mana before calling this method to
    avoid failed casts. Also, verify that the target is within range and not under
    any immunity effects that would prevent the spell from being applied.
