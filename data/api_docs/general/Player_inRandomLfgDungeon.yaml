documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player is currently in a random dungeon finder instance.
  description: This method determines if the player is participating in a Random Dungeon
    Finder (RDF) instance, which is part of the World of Warcraft's LFG system. It
    returns true when the player is inside a random dungeon group, and false otherwise.
    The method is typically used to verify whether a player is currently engaged in
    a random dungeon activity, such as those found in the LFG system for players level
    10-80. This functionality is essential for managing player progression through
    various content areas including dungeons, raids, and other instances that require
    random group finding.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player is currently in a Random Dungeon Finder instance,
    false otherwise. The method does not return null or error values as it is a simple
    boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->inRandomLfgDungeon()) {\n    // Player is in a random dungeon\n\
      \    // Do something here\n}\nelse {\n    // Player is not in a random dungeon\n\
      \    // Do something else here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard Player class API and does not require
    any special initialization or setup. It simply checks the current player state
    within the LFG system, making it useful for determining whether a player is currently
    participating in random dungeon content.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking player status during
    gameplay, as it may affect game mechanics related to group finding and instance
    management. Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other LFG-related
    methods to avoid conflicts or incorrect state checks.
