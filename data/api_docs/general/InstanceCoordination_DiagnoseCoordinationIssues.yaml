  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: DiagnoseCoordinationIssues
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::DiagnoseCoordinationIssues(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and reports potential coordination issues within a group instance.
  description: The DiagnoseCoordinationIssues method evaluates the current state of
    group coordination for a specified group, identifying possible problems such as
    mismatched instance requirements, player synchronization issues, or invalid group
    compositions. This diagnostic function is typically used during instance entry
    or group management to ensure that all players in the group meet the necessary
    criteria for joining an instance. The method does not modify any state but provides
    insights into potential failures that could prevent successful instance entry
    or operation.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: A pointer to the Group object representing the group whose coordination
      status will be analyzed. Must not be null and must represent a valid group with
      members.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DiagnoseCoordinationIssues
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    instanceCoordination->DiagnoseCoordinationIssues(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for debugging and internal diagnostics.
    It may be called during group creation, instance entry, or periodic checks to
    ensure that groups are properly coordinated before entering instances. The diagnostic
    output is typically logged or displayed in the game console for developers or
    administrators.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer passed to this method is valid and not null;
    otherwise, calling this method may result in undefined behavior or crashes. This
    function should not be used as a replacement for proper group validation checks
    during instance entry.
