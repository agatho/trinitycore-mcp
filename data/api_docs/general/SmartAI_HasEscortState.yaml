  method: HasEscortState
  signature: bool SmartAI::HasEscortState(uint32 escortState) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the SmartAI instance has a specific escort state flag set.
  description: The HasEscortState method determines whether a given escort state flag
    is currently active within the SmartAI instance. This method is typically used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment to manage NPC escort behaviors,
    such as checking if an NPC is currently moving, paused, or has completed an escort
    mission. The method evaluates internal state flags and returns true if the specified
    escort state is set, otherwise false. It serves as a predicate function for conditional
    logic within AI scripts that control quest-related NPC behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified escort state flag is currently active in
    the SmartAI instance; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Escort State Check
    code: "if (creature->GetAI()->HasEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_MOVING))\n{\n    //\
      \ NPC is currently moving during escort\n    // Perform movement-related actions\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic with Multiple States
    code: "SmartAI* ai = creature->GetAI();\nif (ai->HasEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_MOVING)\
      \ && !ai->HasEscortState(ESCORT_STATE_PAUSED))\n{\n    // Only act if NPC is\
      \ moving and not paused\n    ai->DoAction(ACTION_CONTINUE_ESCORT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on internal state flags managed by the SmartAI system.
    The escort states are typically defined as bit flags, allowing multiple states
    to be active simultaneously. The method is designed for performance-critical AI
    evaluation and should not be used in tight loops without consideration of its
    impact.
  warnings: Ensure that the escort state parameter passed to this method corresponds
    to valid predefined constants (e.g., ESCORT_STATE_MOVING, ESCORT_STATE_PAUSED)
    to avoid undefined behavior. Using invalid or uninitialized state values may lead
    to incorrect results.
