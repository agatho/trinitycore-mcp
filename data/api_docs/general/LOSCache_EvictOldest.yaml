documentation:
  brief: Removes the oldest entry from the line-of-sight cache.
  description: The EvictOldest method is responsible for removing the least recently
    used entry from the LOSCache. This cache is typically used to store computed line-of-sight
    results between game objects to avoid redundant calculations. When the cache reaches
    its maximum capacity, the oldest entry (based on access time) is automatically
    evicted to make room for new entries. This method ensures that the cache maintains
    a reasonable size and performance characteristics by periodically clearing out
    stale data.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: 'LOSCache cache;

      // ... populate cache with line-of-sight calculations ...

      cache.EvictOldest(); // Remove oldest entry when cache is full'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the LOSCache implementation
    when adding new entries would exceed the maximum cache size. It's important to
    understand that this operation modifies the internal state of the cache and may
    affect subsequent line-of-sight queries that depend on cached results.
