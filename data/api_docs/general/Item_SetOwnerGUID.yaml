  class: Item
  method: SetOwnerGUID
  signature: void Item::SetOwnerGUID(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the owner GUID of an item to associate it with a player character.
  description: The SetOwnerGUID method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to an Item
    object, linking it to a specific player character in the game world. This is essential
    for proper item management and ensures that the item's ownership is correctly
    tracked within the TrinityCore framework. The method typically updates internal
    fields of the item object to reflect the new owner relationship, which affects
    how the item behaves in terms of gameplay mechanics such as auction house interactions,
    character inventory management, and item binding status.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who will own the item.
      This should be a valid GUID representing a player character within the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetOwnerGUID(12345);

      // Item now belongs to player with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during item creation or when transferring ownership
    of items between players. It should be called before any gameplay-related operations
    that depend on the item's owner, such as auction house transactions or character
    inventory updates. The GUID parameter must be valid and represent a player character;
    otherwise, the item may not behave correctly in-game.
  warnings: Improper use of SetOwnerGUID can lead to incorrect item ownership tracking,
    causing issues with item binding, auction house behavior, or character inventory
    management. Avoid calling this method with invalid GUIDs or without proper validation
    checks.
