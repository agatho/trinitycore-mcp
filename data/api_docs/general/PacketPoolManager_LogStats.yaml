  brief: Logs detailed statistics about packet pool usage and memory allocation.
  description: The LogStats method outputs comprehensive diagnostic information about
    the packet pool manager's current state, including allocated packets, free packets,
    and memory utilization metrics. This method is typically used for debugging and
    performance monitoring purposes to understand how packet memory is being managed
    within the TrinityCore server. The statistics are logged using the standard TrinityCore
