  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: EnableAdvancedFeatures
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::EnableAdvancedFeatures(uint32 botGuid, bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables advanced features for a specified bot in the objective
    tracker.
  description: The EnableAdvancedFeatures method controls whether advanced tracking
    functionalities are activated for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This
    functionality is typically used in automated questing or botting systems within
    World of Warcraft to enhance objective tracking capabilities. The method modifies
    internal state flags that determine how objectives are processed and displayed
    for the given bot. It does not directly affect player behavior but influences
    the underlying tracking system's behavior for automated entities.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which advanced features
      should be enabled or disabled. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity
      in the game world.
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      advanced tracking features for the specified bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Advanced Features for a Bot
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = sObjectMgr->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->EnableAdvancedFeatures(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Advanced Features for a Bot
    code: 'ObjectiveTracker* tracker = sObjectMgr->GetObjectiveTracker();

      tracker->EnableAdvancedFeatures(67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal flags within the ObjectiveTracker class
    that control feature availability. It should be called before attempting to use
    advanced tracking features for the specified bot. The method may have performance
    implications if frequently toggled, as it could trigger internal state updates
    or refreshes of tracking data.
  warnings: Ensure that the botGuid corresponds to an actual existing bot entity;
    otherwise, behavior is undefined. Improper usage might lead to inconsistent tracking
    states or unexpected behavior in automated questing systems.
