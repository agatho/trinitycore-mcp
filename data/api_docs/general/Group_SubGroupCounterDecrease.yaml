  class: Group
  method: SubGroupCounterDecrease
  signature: void Group::SubGroupCounterDecrease(int subgroup)
documentation:
  brief: Decrements the subgroup counter for the specified subgroup within the group.
  description: The SubGroupCounterDecrease method reduces the internal counter associated
    with a specific subgroup in the group. This counter typically tracks the number
    of players or members within that subgroup. The method is used internally by the
    group management system to maintain accurate subgroup membership counts, particularly
    during player joins, leaves, or reassignments between subgroups. It ensures that
    the group's internal data structures remain consistent when subgroup compositions
    change.
  parameters:
  - name: subgroup
    description: The index of the subgroup whose counter should be decremented. Subgroup
      indices are typically zero-based and correspond to the internal structure of
      the group's subgroups.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decrement subgroup counter after player leaves
    code: "void HandlePlayerLeave(Group* group, uint8 subgroupId)\n{\n    // Assume\
      \ player is leaving a specific subgroup\n    group->SubGroupCounterDecrease(subgroupId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of an internal mechanism for maintaining group
    state consistency. It should only be called when a member legitimately leaves
    or is removed from a subgroup to prevent inconsistent counters.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may lead to incorrect subgroup
    counts and can cause unexpected behavior in group-related operations such as loot
    distribution or raid management.
