documentation:
  brief: Collects and processes mount data for the player's behavior manager
  description: The CollectMounts method retrieves and organizes information about
    mounts available to the player within the AdvancedBehaviorManager. This method
    typically gathers data such as mount IDs, availability status, and unlock conditions
    to support AI-driven decision making in mount-related behaviors. It is designed
    to be called during behavior initialization or when mount state changes occur,
    ensuring that the behavior manager has up-to-date information about the player's
    mount collection. The method does not directly modify game state but prepares
    internal data structures for subsequent mount-based actions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mount Collection Usage
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr = player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();

      behaviorMgr->CollectMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after mount data has been updated or when the
    behavior manager requires fresh mount information. It is typically invoked during
    AI initialization or periodic updates rather than on every game tick for performance
    reasons.
