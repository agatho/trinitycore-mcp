documentation:
  brief: Returns the starting level of a player based on race and class.
  description: This method retrieves the default starting level for a player character
    based on their race and class. It is used to determine what level a player begins
    the game at, which affects gameplay mechanics such as experience requirements,
    quest availability, and progression. The method considers the character template
    ID to adjust for special cases like custom classes or race-specific starting levels.
    This information is crucial for maintaining proper game balance and ensuring players
    start at appropriate levels based on their chosen class and race.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The player's race, which determines the starting level. Valid values
      are 1-11 representing different races (Human, Dwarf, Night Elf, Gnome, Draenei,
      Orc, Undead, Tauren, Troll, Blood Elf, and Scourge).
  - name: playerClass
    description: The player's class, which determines the starting level. Valid values
      are 1-12 representing different classes (Warrior, Paladin, Hunter, Rogue, Priest,
      Death Knight, Shaman, Mage, Warlock, Druid, Evoker, and Monk).
  - name: characterTemplateId
    description: The character template ID used to determine special starting levels.
      This parameter allows for customizations or adjustments based on specific game
      configurations or expansions.
  returns: Returns the starting level of the player, typically between 1 and 60 depending
    on race and class combinations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint8 startLevel = player->GetStartLevel(1, 1, 0); // Player with Human
      Warrior
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: uint8 startLevel = player->GetStartLevel(11, 12, 1001); // Scourge Monk
      with custom template
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during character creation or when initializing
    player data. It's important to note that this method does not consider the actual
    player's level but rather the default starting level based on race and class combination.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it may affect game balance if
    used incorrectly. The character template ID parameter can lead to unexpected results
    if not properly configured.
