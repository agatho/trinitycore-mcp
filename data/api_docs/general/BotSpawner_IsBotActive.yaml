  class: BotSpawner
  method: IsBotActive
  signature: bool BotSpawner::IsBotActive(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a bot with the specified GUID is currently active in the system.
  description: 'The IsBotActive method determines if a bot identified by its unique
    global identifier (GUID) is currently active within the TrinityCore instance.
    This function is typically used to verify the operational status of bots, particularly
    in automated player or NPC bot systems. It performs a lookup in the internal bot
    management structures to confirm whether the specified bot is registered and running.
    The method does not modify any state but only reads from the current bot registry.
    Precondition: The GUID must be valid and correspond to an existing bot within
    the system. Postcondition: Returns true if the bot exists and is active, false
    otherwise.'
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the bot to check for activity
      status. This value must be a positive integer representing a valid bot instance
      within the TrinityCore system.
  returns: Returns true if the bot with the specified GUID is currently active and
    registered in the system; otherwise, returns false if the bot does not exist or
    is inactive.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific bot is active
    code: "if (botSpawner.IsBotActive(12345)) {\n    // Bot with GUID 12345 is active\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Bot 12345 is currently active.\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Bot with GUID 12345 is not active\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot 12345 is not\
      \ active.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a lookup operation in the bot registry, which may involve
    iterating through internal data structures. For high-frequency checks, consider
    caching results or using alternative indexing mechanisms to improve performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to an actual bot instance; passing
    invalid or non-existent GUIDs might lead to undefined behavior depending on implementation
    details of the underlying registry.
