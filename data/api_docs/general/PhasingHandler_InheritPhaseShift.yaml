  class: PhasingHandler
  method: InheritPhaseShift
  signature: void PhasingHandler::InheritPhaseShift(WorldObject * target, const WorldObject
    * source)
documentation:
  brief: Inherits the phase shift from a source object to a target object, synchronizing
    their phasing states.
  description: The InheritPhaseShift method synchronizes the phase shift state between
    two WorldObject instances. It copies the phase information from a source object
    to a target object, ensuring that both objects share the same phasing context.
    This is commonly used in World of Warcraft's phasing system where certain game
    events or creature behaviors require objects to inherit the phasing state of another
    object. The method operates within TrinityCore's phasing framework and affects
    how objects are visible or interactable based on player phase restrictions. It
    does not return any value but modifies the target object's internal phase shift
    data.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that will inherit the phase shift from
      the source. This object's phasing state will be updated to match the source.
  - name: source
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject whose phase shift information will be
      inherited by the target. Must not be null and should have valid phase data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Phase Shift Inheritance
    code: 'Creature* targetCreature = ...;

      Player* sourcePlayer = ...;

      PhasingHandler::InheritPhaseShift(targetCreature, sourcePlayer);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Inheriting Phase Shift for Event-Based Visibility
    code: "void HandleSpecialEvent(Unit* eventSource, Unit* affectedUnit)\n{\n   \
      \ if (eventSource && affectedUnit)\n    {\n        PhasingHandler::InheritPhaseShift(affectedUnit,\
      \ eventSource);\n        // Now affectedUnit will inherit the phase of eventSource\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's phasing system which controls object
    visibility based on player phases. The implementation internally updates the target's
    phase shift data to match that of the source. It's important to ensure both objects
    are valid and in the same context before calling this method to avoid unexpected
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with null pointers will result in undefined behavior.
    Ensure that both target and source WorldObjects are properly initialized and valid
    before invoking this function. Improper usage can lead to incorrect phasing states
    or visibility issues for players.
