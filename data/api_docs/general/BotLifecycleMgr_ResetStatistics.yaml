    timers, and performance metrics that track bot behavior and usage. The method

  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will erase all previously collected
    statistical data for bots. It is recommended to back up any important statistics
    before invoking this function.
  warnings: Calling ResetStatistics will permanently delete all existing bot statistics,
    which may affect ongoing analysis or reporting. Ensure that no active monitoring
    or logging systems are relying on the current statistic values.
