  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: GetEncounterStrategy
  signature: EncounterStrategy DungeonBehavior::GetEncounterStrategy(uint32 groupId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the encounter strategy for a specified group within a dungeon.
  description: The GetEncounterStrategy method returns the EncounterStrategy associated
    with a given groupId in the context of a dungeon behavior. This method is typically
    used to determine how encounters should be handled or executed based on group
    composition or other dungeon-specific logic. The returned strategy may influence
    encounter difficulty, spawn patterns, or other dynamic behaviors during dungeon
    progression. The method assumes that the DungeonBehavior instance has been properly
    initialized with valid group data and encounter configurations.
  parameters: []
  returns: An EncounterStrategy object representing the strategy to be used for the
    specified group's encounters. This may include settings such as difficulty levels,
    spawn rules, or behavioral modifications for the encounter.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeon;

      uint32 groupId = 1;

      EncounterStrategy strategy = dungeon.GetEncounterStrategy(groupId);

      // Use the strategy to configure encounter behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger dungeon management system and may
    rely on internal data structures or configuration files. It's important to ensure
    that the groupId parameter corresponds to an existing group within the dungeon
    context to avoid undefined behavior.
