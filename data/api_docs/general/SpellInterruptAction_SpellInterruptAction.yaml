documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new SpellInterruptAction instance with default values.
  description: The SpellInterruptAction constructor initializes a new instance of
    the SpellInterruptAction class. This class is typically used within the TrinityCore
    WoW emulation framework to handle spell interruption logic during combat or other
    game events. The constructor sets up internal state variables and prepares the
    object for use in spell processing systems. It ensures that all necessary data
    members are properly initialized before the action can be executed or processed
    by the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new SpellInterruptAction instance
    code: 'SpellInterruptAction interruptAction;

      // The object is now ready to be used for spell interruption logic'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation. It simply sets default values for internal state variables. In TrinityCore's
    architecture, this class likely serves as a base or helper class for more specialized
    spell interruption handling.
