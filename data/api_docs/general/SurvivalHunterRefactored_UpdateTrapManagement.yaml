documentation:
  brief: Manages the deployment, activation, and removal of traps for a survival hunter
    class.
  description: The UpdateTrapManagement method is responsible for handling all aspects
    of trap management within the Survival Hunter AI system. It evaluates the current
    game state, determines when and where to place traps, ensures proper cooldowns
    are respected, and handles trap activation logic. This method integrates with
    the hunter's resource management system to ensure optimal use of trap-based abilities
    while maintaining balance with other gameplay mechanics such as pet behavior and
    threat generation. The method typically runs during each AI update cycle to dynamically
    adjust trap placement based on target positioning, environmental factors, and
    combat conditions.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void SurvivalHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n\
      \    m_hunter->UpdateTrapManagement();\n    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper trap management. It relies on internal state tracking of trap cooldowns,
    target positions, and hunter resource levels. The implementation may vary based
    on specific hunter specialization or gear configuration.
  warnings: Improper handling of trap placement can lead to performance issues or
    unintended gameplay behavior. Ensure that trap activation conditions are properly
    validated to prevent duplicate trap placement or invalid targeting scenarios.
