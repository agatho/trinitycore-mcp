  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: TransitionToState
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::TransitionToState(GroupState newState)
documentation:
  brief: Transitions the group coordinator to a new state, updating internal state
    management and triggering relevant callbacks.
  description: The TransitionToState method is responsible for changing the current
    operational state of a GroupCoordinator instance. This method manages the flow
    of group operations by transitioning from one defined state to another, ensuring
    that all necessary setup and cleanup procedures are executed during the state
    change. The method likely handles synchronization between group members, updates
    internal flags or timers, and may trigger event notifications to dependent systems.
    It serves as a core component in managing group lifecycle events such as formation,
    disbanding, or reorganization within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: newState
    description: The target GroupState enum value that the coordinator should transition
      to. Valid values typically include states like GROUP_STATE_IDLE, GROUP_STATE_FORMING,
      GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE, and GROUP_STATE_DISBANDED. The specific enum values depend
      on the implementation but generally represent distinct phases of group operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Transition
    code: 'GroupCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.TransitionToState(GROUP_STATE_ACTIVE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: State Change with Error Handling
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coord = GetGroupCoordinator();\nif (coord)\n{\n    coord->TransitionToState(GROUP_STATE_FORMING);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle error case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only when the coordinator is in a valid state
    that allows transitions. The implementation may include checks to prevent invalid
    state changes and could involve thread synchronization if multiple threads are
    accessing the coordinator. It's recommended to ensure that all group members are
    notified of state changes for proper coordination.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or unsupported GroupState value might
    lead to undefined behavior or system instability. Ensure that the newState parameter
    is one of the predefined valid states within the GroupState enum. Avoid calling
    this method during critical sections where concurrent access could cause race
    conditions.
