documentation:
  brief: Loads quest details from database fields into internal quest data structures.
  description: This method initializes the internal quest data structure by loading
    information from database fields. It processes the raw data fields to populate
    various quest-related attributes such as quest ID, title, level requirements,
    and other quest-specific properties. The method ensures that all quest details
    are properly loaded and validated before being used in game mechanics. This is
    typically called during quest initialization when the quest object is being constructed
    from database data.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Quest quest;

      quest.LoadQuestDetails(nullptr);

      // Quest details are now loaded and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally during quest object construction.
    It should be invoked only once per quest instance to avoid data corruption. The
    method assumes that database fields are properly formatted and contain valid data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same quest object may cause
    data corruption or inconsistent behavior. Ensure that the quest object is not
    already initialized before calling this method.
