  class: BotLoginQueryHolder
  method: GetAccountId
  signature: int BotLoginQueryHolder::GetAccountId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the account identifier associated with the bot login query holder.
  description: The GetAccountId method returns the unique identifier (ID) of the account
    that owns the bot login data stored within this query holder. This ID is typically
    used to authenticate and manage bot accounts within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method does not perform any database operations; it simply retrieves a pre-fetched
    or previously set account ID from internal storage. It is commonly used in bot
    management systems where account-specific permissions or configurations need to
    be accessed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the account ID of the bot login. A value of 0 typically
    indicates an invalid or unset account ID, while positive integers represent valid
    account identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotLoginQueryHolder queryHolder;\n// Assume queryHolder has been initialized\
      \ with valid data\nint accountId = queryHolder.GetAccountId();\nif (accountId\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Account ID: \" << accountId << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    std::cout << \"Invalid account ID\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the account ID has already been populated within
    the query holder, likely during initialization or a prior database fetch operation.
    It is not thread-safe if the underlying data structure is modified concurrently.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotLoginQueryHolder instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method, as returning 0 may indicate either an unset value or a real
    account ID of 0 (which should be rare).
