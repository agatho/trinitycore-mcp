documentation:
  brief: Sends a LFG proposal update to the player's client
  description: The SendLfgUpdateProposal method is responsible for transmitting the
    current state of a Looking for Group (LFG) proposal to the player's client. This
    method is typically invoked when a group leader or dungeon finder system needs
    to inform players about changes in a proposed dungeon group, such as member additions,
    removals, or status updates. The method serializes the provided LFG proposal data
    and sends it over the network to ensure all players in the session are synchronized
    with the current group composition and proposal state.
  parameters:
  - name: proposal
    description: A constant reference to an lfg::LfgProposal object containing the
      current state of the LFG proposal, including group members, dungeon information,
      and proposal status.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Sending a basic LFG proposal update
    code: 'lfg::LfgProposal proposal;

      // ... populate proposal with data ...

      worldSession->SendLfgUpdateProposal(proposal);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided proposal object is valid and properly
    initialized. The actual network transmission is handled internally by the WorldSession
    class, and the method does not return any status information about delivery success.
