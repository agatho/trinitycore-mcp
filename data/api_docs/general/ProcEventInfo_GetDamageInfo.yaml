  method: GetDamageInfo
  signature: DamageInfo * ProcEventInfo::GetDamageInfo() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the damage information associated with a proc event.
  description: The GetDamageInfo method returns a pointer to the DamageInfo object
    that contains detailed information about the damage dealt during the proc event.
    This method is typically used within spell or ability trigger handlers to access
    specific damage data such as damage amount, damage type, and other relevant combat
    statistics. The returned pointer is valid only during the execution of the proc
    event handler and should not be stored for later use. This method is essential
    for implementing effects that modify or react to damage dealt by procs.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a DamageInfo object containing detailed information about
    the damage dealt during the proc event, or nullptr if no damage information is
    available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Proc Handler
    code: "void MySpell::HandleProc(Unit* target, ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n \
      \   DamageInfo* damageInfo = eventInfo.GetDamageInfo();\n    if (damageInfo)\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 damage = damageInfo->GetDamage();\n        // Process\
      \ the damage value\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Proc Damage
    code: "void MyAbility::HandleProc(Unit* target, ProcEventInfo& eventInfo)\n{\n\
      \    DamageInfo* damageInfo = eventInfo.GetDamageInfo();\n    if (damageInfo)\n\
      \    {\n        uint32 originalDamage = damageInfo->GetDamage();\n        uint32\
      \ modifiedDamage = originalDamage * 1.5f; // 50% increase\n        damageInfo->SetDamage(modifiedDamage);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The DamageInfo object returned by this method is managed internally by the
    proc event system and should not be deleted or modified beyond what is allowed
    by the API. The pointer may be null if the proc event does not involve damage,
    such as when triggering on healing or other non-damage effects.
  warnings: Do not store the returned pointer for later use as it may become invalid
    after the proc event handler completes. Always check for null before dereferencing
    the returned pointer to avoid crashes.
