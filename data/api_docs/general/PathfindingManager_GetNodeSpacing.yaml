  method: GetNodeSpacing
  signature: float PathfindingManager::GetNodeSpacing() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spacing value used between nodes in the pathfinding grid.
  description: The GetNodeSpacing method retrieves the configured spacing distance
    between navigation nodes in the pathfinding system. This value determines how
    frequently waypoints are placed in the AI navigation mesh, directly impacting
    both path resolution and performance. A smaller spacing value results in more
    detailed paths but increased memory usage and processing overhead, while a larger
    spacing value reduces resource consumption at the cost of path fidelity. The returned
    value is typically expressed in game units (yards or meters) and corresponds to
    the grid cell size used for navigation node placement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the distance (in game units) between adjacent
    nodes in the pathfinding grid. This value should be positive and typically ranges
    from 0.5 to 10.0 depending on the specific implementation and map requirements.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float spacing = sPathfinder->GetNodeSpacing();

      printf("Current node spacing: %.2f units\n", spacing);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Pathfinding Configuration Check
    code: "PathfindingManager* pathfinder = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayer(guid)->GetMotionMaster()->GetPathfinder();\n\
      if (pathfinder)\n{\n    float spacing = pathfinder->GetNodeSpacing();\n    if\
      \ (spacing < 1.0f)\n        printf(\"Warning: Low node spacing may cause performance\
      \ issues\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the pathfinding system and should
    not be called frequently in performance-critical code paths. The node spacing
    value is usually initialized during map loading and remains constant throughout
    a session unless explicitly modified through configuration files or admin commands.
  warnings: Modifying node spacing values at runtime may cause inconsistencies in
    existing path calculations and could lead to AI behavior anomalies. This method
    should only be called when the pathfinding system is not actively processing paths
    to avoid race conditions.
