  notes: This method directly modifies the NPCFlags2 field of the unit object. It
    should be used carefully as it may affect how NPCs interact with players or other
    game mechanics. The method is typically used in conjunction with other NPC flag
    manipulation methods to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected NPC behavior or interaction
    issues. Care should be taken when modifying NPC flags2 values, especially in scenarios
    where multiple flags are involved.
