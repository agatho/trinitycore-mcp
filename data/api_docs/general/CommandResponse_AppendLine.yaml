  class: CommandResponse

  signature: CommandResponse & CommandResponse::AppendLine(std::string line)
documentation:
  brief: Appends a new line of text to the command response object for building multi-line
    command outputs.
  description: The AppendLine method adds a new line of text to the internal string
    buffer of a CommandResponse object. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's
    command system to accumulate multiple lines of output that will be sent back to
    the player or console when a game command is executed. It supports chaining, allowing
    multiple lines to be added sequentially. The appended line is typically formatted
    as a single string and may include formatting characters or special codes depending
    on how the response is intended to be displayed. This method does not perform
    any validation of the input line, so it accepts any valid std::string value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current CommandResponse object, enabling method chaining
    for appending multiple lines in a single statement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CommandResponse response;

      response.AppendLine("Hello, World!");

      response.AppendLine("This is line two.");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "CommandResponse response;\nresponse.AppendLine(\"First line.\")\n    .AppendLine(\"\
      Second line.\")\n    .AppendLine(\"Third line.\");"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the command handling infrastructure in TrinityCore
    and is typically used within command handler functions to build structured output
    messages. The implementation likely uses an internal string buffer or stream that
    accumulates text until the response is finalized and sent back to the client.
