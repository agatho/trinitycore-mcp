api:
  class: MaelstromTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void MaelstromTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the MaelstromTracker state for the specified player, processing any
    pending maelstrom effects or events.
  description: The Update method in the MaelstromTracker class is responsible for
    maintaining and refreshing the state of maelstrom-related mechanics for a given
    player. This typically involves checking and applying any active maelstrom effects,
    updating internal timers or counters, and ensuring that the player's maelstrom
    status remains synchronized with game logic. The method is commonly called during
    player update cycles or when specific maelstrom-triggering events occur within
    the game world. It may also handle cleanup of expired effects or transitions between
    different maelstrom states. This method is crucial for maintaining accurate tracking
    of maelstrom buffs, debuffs, or other related gameplay elements that affect the
    player's abilities or stats.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose maelstrom state needs to be updated.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player instance
      in the game world.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Update Loop
    code: "void Player::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    maelstromTracker.Update(this);\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Maelstrom Update Trigger
    code: "void HandleMaelstromEvent(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->GetMaelstromTracker())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetMaelstromTracker()->Update(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during player update cycles to ensure
    accurate tracking of maelstrom effects. The implementation may involve checking
    for expired effects, updating visual indicators, and modifying player stats or
    abilities based on current maelstrom state. It's recommended to avoid calling
    this method outside of the main game loop or update context to prevent potential
    synchronization issues.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to the bot parameter will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is valid and in a usable state
    before calling Update. This method may modify player stats or abilities, so use
    caution when calling it manually outside of normal update flow.
