  class: SocialManager
  method: GenerateChatResponse
  signature: std::string SocialManager::GenerateChatResponse(const std::string & message,
    ChatType type)
documentation:
  brief: Generates a chat response based on the provided message and chat type.
  description: The GenerateChatResponse method processes an incoming chat message
    and returns an appropriate system-generated response. This method is typically
    used in social interactions within the game, such as handling player queries or
    triggering automated replies. The behavior of the response depends on both the
    content of the input message and the specified chat type (e.g., say, whisper,
    guild chat). It may involve parsing the message for keywords, checking against
    predefined response rules, and formatting a suitable reply string.
  parameters:
  - name: message
    description: The input chat message to be processed. This is a string containing
      the text sent by the player or system.
  - name: type
    description: The type of chat channel where the message was sent. This determines
      how the response should be formatted and handled, such as private messages (whisper),
      public chat, guild chat, etc.
  returns: A std::string representing the generated chat response. The returned string
    may be empty if no appropriate response could be generated or if the input message
    is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: std::string response = socialManager.GenerateChatResponse("Hello there!",
      CHAT_TYPE_SAY);
    language: cpp
  - title: Whisper Response Generation
    code: std::string whisperResponse = socialManager.GenerateChatResponse("What's
      up?", CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal databases or rule sets to determine
    appropriate responses. It may be used in conjunction with AI-driven chat systems
    or predefined reply tables. The implementation might include localization support
    for different languages.
  warnings: Ensure that the message parameter is sanitized before being passed to
    prevent injection attacks or unintended behavior. The method does not validate
    the ChatType enum value, so invalid types may lead to undefined behavior.
