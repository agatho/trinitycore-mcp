  class: SpellInfo
  method: IsEmpowerSpell
  signature: bool SpellInfo::IsEmpowerSpell() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the spell is an empower spell that enhances the caster's
    abilities.
  description: This method checks if the current spell is classified as an empower
    spell within the TrinityCore framework. Empower spells typically enhance the caster's
    capabilities or provide additional effects that boost the spell's performance.
    The method returns true when the spell is specifically categorized as an empower
    spell, allowing developers to identify and handle such spells appropriately in
    game mechanics and logic. This functionality is crucial for implementing special
    spell behaviors and ensuring proper handling of empowered spells during execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell is classified as an empower spell, false otherwise.
    The method does not return null values as it is a boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (spellInfo->IsEmpowerSpell()) {\n    // Handle empowered spell logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Spell Effects
    code: "SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(12345);\nif (spellInfo\
      \ && spellInfo->IsEmpowerSpell()) {\n    // Apply special effects for empowered\
      \ spells\n    // This could be used in spell processing or handling logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related methods
    to determine spell classification. Implementation relies on internal spell database
    flags and classifications. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a
    simple boolean check.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method in conjunction with other
    spell classification methods, as the logic may depend on specific spell definitions
    within TrinityCore's spell system. Incorrect usage could lead to misclassification
    of spells.
