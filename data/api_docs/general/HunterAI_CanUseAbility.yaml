  class: HunterAI
  method: CanUseAbility
  signature: bool HunterAI::CanUseAbility(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a hunter AI can use a specified spell ability based on
    current game state and conditions.
  description: The CanUseAbility method evaluates if a hunter's AI is currently capable
    of casting a specific spell. It checks various preconditions such as mana availability,
    cooldown status, target validity, and other game mechanics relevant to the hunter
    class. This method is typically used within the AI decision-making process to
    determine valid actions for the hunter during combat. The evaluation considers
    both immediate requirements (like resource costs) and contextual factors (such
    as player state or environmental conditions).
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell ability to check. This corresponds
      to the Spell ID used in the TrinityCore database.
  returns: Returns true if the hunter AI can use the specified spell ability under
    current conditions, otherwise returns false. The method will return false if the
    spell is on cooldown, the hunter lacks required resources (mana, focus, etc.),
    or if the target is invalid or unreachable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a hunter can use Arcane Shot
    code: "if (hunterAI->CanUseAbility(3044)) {\n    // Execute Arcane Shot\n    hunterAI->CastSpell(3044);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using CanUseAbility in a conditional AI decision
    code: "if (hunterAI->CanUseAbility(75)) {\n    // Check if Steady Shot is available\n\
      \    hunterAI->CastSpell(75);\n} else if (hunterAI->CanUseAbility(19434)) {\n\
      \    // Otherwise try to use Aimed Shot\n    hunterAI->CastSpell(19434);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Hunter AI system and integrates with TrinityCore's
    spell system. It should be called before attempting to cast a spell to avoid invalid
    actions. The method may perform multiple checks internally including cooldowns,
    resource levels, target state, and line-of-sight conditions.
  warnings: Do not assume that a spell can be cast just because CanUseAbility returns
    true; additional validation may still be required for complex scenarios. Calling
    this method without proper AI context might lead to incorrect behavior or performance
    issues.
