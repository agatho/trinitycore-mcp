  method: UnholyFesteringWoundTracker
  signature: void UnholyFesteringWoundTracker::UnholyFesteringWoundTracker()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the UnholyFesteringWoundTracker class for tracking
    unholy festering wound effects.
  description: The UnholyFesteringWoundTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the tracker class used to monitor and manage the effects of the unholy festering
    wound ability in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation. This tracker
    is typically associated with death knights and their unholy specialization, specifically
    tracking the damage-over-time effects applied by the Festering Wound spell. The
    constructor sets up internal state variables and initializes tracking mechanisms
    necessary for handling periodic damage application, duration tracking, and effect
    cleanup when the wound expires or is removed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new UnholyFesteringWoundTracker instance
    code: 'UnholyFesteringWoundTracker* tracker = new UnholyFesteringWoundTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track festering wound effects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the game engine when a
    death knight applies the Festering Wound effect to a target. Developers should
    not directly instantiate this class unless implementing custom spell handling
    or debugging functionality. The tracker manages its own lifecycle and cleanup
    of tracked effects.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of this class outside of TrinityCore's internal systems
    may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. This is an internal tracking mechanism,
    not intended for public API usage.
