  class: Player
  method: RemoveVisibleForcedReaction
  signature: void Player::RemoveVisibleForcedReaction(uint32 factionId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a forced reaction visibility for a specified faction ID from the
    player.
  description: This method removes the forced reaction visibility for a given faction
    ID from the player's visible reactions. It is used to control how the player's
    faction relationships appear in the game world, particularly when dealing with
    forced reactions that may be set by game mechanics or scripts. The method allows
    players to hide specific faction reactions that would otherwise be visible, effectively
    removing them from their visible reaction list. This functionality is important
    for managing player character behavior and ensuring proper display of faction
    relationships.
  parameters:
  - name: factionId
    description: The faction ID for which the forced reaction visibility should be
      removed. This parameter specifies which faction's forced reaction should no
      longer be visible to the player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Forced Reaction Visibility
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveVisibleForcedReaction(1124); // Remove forced reaction for faction
      ID 1124'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method operates on the player's visible reaction list and may affect
    how factions appear in the player's UI. It is typically used in conjunction with
    other faction-related methods to manage player behavior and reaction visibility.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can affect player's faction
    relationship display, potentially causing confusion if not properly managed. Improper
    use may lead to unexpected behavior in faction interactions.
