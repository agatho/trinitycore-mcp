documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the skill level of a specified profession for the player
  description: The GetProfessionSkill method returns the current skill level of a
    given profession for the player. This method is typically used in the context
    of World of Warcraft's economy system, where professions like Mining, Herbalism,
    or Blacksmithing have associated skill levels that affect crafting capabilities
    and rewards. The method takes a Profession enum parameter that specifies which
    profession's skill level should be retrieved. It is important to note that this
    method does not validate whether the player actually has the specified profession
    trained; it simply returns the stored skill value for that profession, which may
    be zero if untrained.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the current skill level of the specified
    profession. A return value of 0 typically indicates that the profession is not
    trained or available to the player. Higher values represent increased proficiency
    in the profession, with maximum skill levels usually capped at 750 for most professions
    in World of Warcraft.
  examples:
  - title: Get Mining Skill Level
    code: "uint32 miningSkill = economyMgr.GetProfessionSkill(PROFESSION_MINING);\n\
      if (miningSkill > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Player has Mining skill level: \"\
      \ << miningSkill << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check if Player Has Any Profession Trained
    code: "uint32 blacksmithingSkill = economyMgr.GetProfessionSkill(PROFESSION_BLACKSMITHING);\n\
      uint32 leatherworkingSkill = economyMgr.GetProfessionSkill(PROFESSION_LEATHERWORKING);\n\
      \nif (blacksmithingSkill > 0 || leatherworkingSkill > 0)\n{\n    std::cout <<\
      \ \"Player has at least one trained profession\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EconomyManager class which handles various economic
    aspects of player characters in TrinityCore. The Profession enum values are typically
    defined in the core codebase and map to specific professions like PROFESSION_MINING,
    PROFESSION_HERBALISM, etc. This method should be called only when the player object
    is properly initialized and has profession data loaded. Performance-wise, this
    is a simple lookup operation with O(1) complexity.
  warnings: This method does not validate if the profession is actually available
    to the player or if they have access to it. It simply returns whatever value is
    stored in the internal profession tracking system. If used without checking for
    valid professions, it may return unexpected results. Additionally, calling this
    method on a player who has not yet loaded their profession data may result in
    incorrect values.
