documentation:
  brief: Calculates and updates the time delta between the client and server for synchronization
    purposes.
  description: The ComputeNewClockDelta method computes the difference in time between
    the client and the server to maintain accurate game state synchronization. This
    is crucial for maintaining consistent gameplay mechanics, such as spell casting
    times, movement synchronization, and other time-sensitive operations. The method
    typically gathers timing data from recent network communications and adjusts an
    internal clock delta value that is used throughout the session to correct for
    any discrepancies in system clocks between the client and server.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyWorldSession::HandleTimeSync() {\n    ComputeNewClockDelta();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during regular session maintenance
    or when timing-related packets are received. It's important to understand that
    the computed delta affects how timestamps are interpreted for various game events,
    so accuracy is critical for gameplay consistency.
