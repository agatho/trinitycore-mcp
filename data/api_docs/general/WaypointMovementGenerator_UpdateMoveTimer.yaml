documentation:
  brief: Updates the movement timer for a waypoint-based AI path following behavior.
  description: The UpdateMoveTimer method is responsible for managing the timing logic
    that controls when a creature should advance to the next waypoint in its predefined
    path. It processes the elapsed time since the last update and determines whether
    the creature has completed its current waypoint delay or movement segment. This
    method is typically called during the creature's AI update cycle to ensure smooth
    and timed progression through waypoints. The method returns true if the timer
    has expired and the creature should proceed to the next waypoint, or false if
    it should continue waiting.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the movement timer has expired and the creature should
    advance to the next waypoint; otherwise returns false if the timer is still active
    or the movement is not yet complete.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_movementGenerator->UpdateMoveTimer(diff))\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed to next waypoint\n        MoveToNextWaypoint();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core movement system in TrinityCore and integrates
    with the creature's AI state machine. It relies on accurate timing mechanisms
    and should be called consistently during each AI update cycle for proper waypoint
    progression.
