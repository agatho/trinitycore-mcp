  method: GetFollowAngle
  signature: float Unit::GetFollowAngle() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the angle between the unit and its follow target.
  description: This method calculates and returns the angle in radians between the
    current unit and its follow target, which is typically used for positioning and
    movement calculations in World of Warcraft. The angle represents the direction
    from the unit to its follow target, and is commonly used in pathfinding and movement
    logic. This method is essential for determining proper positioning when a unit
    is following another unit, particularly in scenarios involving complex movement
    patterns or AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: "Returns a float value representing the angle in radians between the unit\
    \ and its follow target. The value typically ranges from 0 to 2\u03C0 radians,\
    \ with 0 being directly in front of the unit, and values increasing clockwise\
    \ as the angle increases."
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: float angle = unit->GetFollowAngle();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    functions to determine proper positioning and pathfinding. It may be affected
    by the unit's orientation and can be influenced by the follow target's position
    relative to the unit.
  warnings: The angle returned by this method may vary depending on the unit's orientation
    and could potentially lead to incorrect positioning if not used carefully in combination
    with other movement calculations.
