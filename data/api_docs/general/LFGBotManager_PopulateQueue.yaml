  class: LFGBotManager
  method: PopulateQueue
  signature: uint32 LFGBotManager::PopulateQueue(int playerGuid, uint8 neededRoles,
    const int & dungeons)
documentation:
  brief: Populates the LFG queue for a given player with specified dungeon and role
    requirements.
  description: The PopulateQueue method is responsible for adding a player to the
    Looking For Group (LFG) queue within the TrinityCore framework. It takes the player's
    GUID, required roles for the group, and a list of dungeons to consider for filling
    the queue. This method ensures that the player is matched with suitable group
    members based on their selected roles and preferred dungeons. The function returns
    a unique identifier representing the queue entry, which can be used for tracking
    or modifying the player's LFG status. It integrates with the core LFG system to
    maintain synchronization between player preferences and available group opportunities.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player requesting to join the
      LFG queue. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: neededRoles
    description: Bitmask representing the roles needed for the group. Each bit corresponds
      to a specific role such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. Valid values are
      typically defined by the LFG system constants.
  - name: dungeons
    description: Reference to an integer array or list containing dungeon identifiers
      that the player is interested in joining. These should correspond to valid dungeon
      entries in the game database.
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique queue identifier assigned
    to this LFG entry. This ID can be used later to modify or remove the player from
    the queue.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 queueId = lfgBotManager.PopulateQueue(12345, LFG_ROLE_TANK | LFG_ROLE_HEALER,
      dungeons);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Multiple Dungeons
    code: 'int dungeonList[] = { 101, 102, 103 }; // Example dungeon IDs

      uint8 roles = LFG_ROLE_TANK | LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE;

      uint32 queueId = lfgBotManager.PopulateQueue(playerGuid, roles, dungeonList);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has already been validated and is eligible
    to participate in LFG activities. The method may perform internal checks for valid
    GUIDs and dungeon IDs before proceeding with queue insertion. Performance considerations
    include potential database lookups and synchronization overhead when adding players
    to large queues.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter corresponds to an actual online player,
    otherwise the method might fail silently or cause unexpected behavior in the LFG
    system. Also, invalid dungeon IDs passed via the dungeons parameter could lead
    to errors or incorrect matching logic.
