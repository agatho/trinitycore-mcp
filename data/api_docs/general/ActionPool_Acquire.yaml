documentation:
  brief: Acquires and returns the next available action ID from the pool
  description: The Acquire method retrieves the next free action identifier from the
    ActionPool, ensuring thread-safe access to a shared resource. It is typically
    used in AI systems or scripting environments where actions need to be uniquely
    identified and managed. The method maintains an internal counter or list of available
    IDs and returns the first available one. If no IDs are available, it may return
    an error code or block until one becomes available depending on implementation
    details. This method is essential for preventing ID conflicts in systems that
    dynamically assign action identifiers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the acquired action ID if successful, or
    a negative value to indicate failure or exhaustion of available IDs. A return
    value of -1 typically signifies no available actions, while positive integers
    represent valid action identifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "ActionPool pool;\nint actionId = pool.Acquire();\nif (actionId >= 0) {\n\
      \    // Use the acquired action ID\n    printf(\"Acquired action ID: %d\\n\"\
      , actionId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error case\n    printf(\"Failed to acquire\
      \ action ID\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI context
    code: "class AIProcessor {\npublic:\n    ActionPool actionPool;\n    \n    void\
      \ AssignAction() {\n        int actionId = actionPool.Acquire();\n        if\
      \ (actionId >= 0) {\n            // Process the action with the assigned ID\n\
      \            ProcessAction(actionId);\n        } else {\n            // Queue\
      \ or delay processing\n            DelayProcessing();\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not be called concurrently
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization. The pool maintains a finite
    set of action IDs, so repeated calls may eventually return negative values when
    exhausted. Consider implementing a mechanism to release IDs back to the pool after
    use.
  warnings: Calling Acquire() repeatedly without releasing IDs back to the pool can
    lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability. Always ensure that
    acquired IDs are properly released or managed to prevent ID leaks. In high-concurrency
    scenarios, consider using lock-free alternatives if available.
