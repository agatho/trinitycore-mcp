documentation:
  brief: Heals the hunter's pet if its health is below a certain threshold.
  description: The MendPetIfNeeded method checks the current health of the hunter's
    active pet and, if the pet's health falls below a predetermined threshold, it
    automatically casts the Mend Pet spell to restore health. This method is typically
    invoked during combat or at regular intervals as part of the hunter's AI behavior
    to ensure the pet remains in fighting condition. It does not perform any action
    if the pet is already at full health or if no pet is currently active.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Hunter AI Loop
    code: "void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other\
      \ AI logic...\n    MendPetIfNeeded();\n    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the hunter's pet being valid and active. It assumes
    that the Mend Pet spell is available and properly configured in the AI context.
    Performance impact is minimal as it only performs a health check and conditional
    spell cast.
