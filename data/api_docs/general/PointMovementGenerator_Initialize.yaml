  class: PointMovementGenerator
  method: Initialize
  signature: void PointMovementGenerator::Initialize(int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the point movement generator with a specified owner.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the PointMovementGenerator for use by
    assigning an owner to it. This method is typically called during the initialization
    phase of a movement generator, ensuring that the generator has a valid reference
    to the object it will control. The owner parameter represents the unit or entity
    that this movement generator will be managing. This setup is essential before
    any movement commands can be executed using this generator.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the owner of this movement generator.
      In TrinityCore, this typically refers to a unit's GUID or identifier that will
      be controlled by this movement generator.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'PointMovementGenerator movementGen;

      int ownerGuid = 12345;

      movementGen.Initialize(&ownerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before any movement operations are performed.
    The owner parameter must point to a valid identifier that represents an existing
    unit in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the owner pointer is valid and points to a live entity; otherwise,
    undefined behavior may occur during movement execution.
