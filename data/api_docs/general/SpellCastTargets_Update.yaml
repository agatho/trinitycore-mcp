  class: SpellCastTargets
  method: Update
  signature: void SpellCastTargets::Update(WorldObject * caster)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the spell cast targets based on the caster's current state and target
    information.
  description: The SpellCastTargets::Update method is responsible for recalculating
    and validating the target positions and states for a spell being cast. It ensures
    that all target-related data in the SpellCastTargets structure reflects the most
    current information from the caster object, including any changes in target positions,
    validity of targets, or target types. This method is typically called during the
    spell casting process to maintain accurate targeting data before the spell is
    executed. The update process may involve validating existing targets, resolving
    new targets based on caster's current state, and updating internal target tracking
    structures.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that is casting the spell. This object
      provides the context for target resolution including position, orientation,
      and target selection logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Casting
    code: 'SpellCastTargets targets;

      WorldObject* caster = player;

      targets.Update(caster);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Targets Before Spell Execution
    code: "SpellCastTargets targets;\nPlayer* player = ...;\ntargets.Update(player);\n\
      if (targets.HasUnitTarget())\n{\n    // Proceed with spell execution using updated\
      \ targets\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the spell system during the
    casting process and should not normally be called directly by external code. The
    implementation may perform target validation checks, position updates, and target
    type resolution based on the caster's current state and spell requirements.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null caster pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the caster object is valid and properly initialized
    before calling Update().
