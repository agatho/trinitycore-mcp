  class: BrainFreezeTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void BrainFreezeTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the BrainFreezeTracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method is responsible for managing and refreshing the Brain
    Freeze buff tracking state for a given player bot. This method typically checks
    the current status of the Brain Freeze spell, updates internal tracking variables,
    and may trigger additional logic based on the buff's state or duration. It is
    commonly used in AI behavior systems to ensure accurate tracking of spell effects
    that influence gameplay mechanics such as mana regeneration or spell casting delays.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose Brain Freeze
      state needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Player* bot = GetBot())\n\
      \    {\n        brainFreezeTracker.Update(bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the AI update loop to maintain
    accurate tracking of the Brain Freeze buff state. The implementation may involve
    checking spell duration, mana costs, or other related mechanics depending on how
    Brain Freeze is defined in the core.
