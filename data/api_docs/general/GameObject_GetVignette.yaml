  class: GameObject
  method: GetVignette
  signature: const Vignettes::VignetteData * GameObject::GetVignette() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vignette data associated with this game object.
  description: This method retrieves the VignetteData structure that defines the visual
    and gameplay properties of a vignette associated with the GameObject. It provides
    access to the vignette's metadata including its ID, position, scale, and other
    relevant attributes. The method is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-side
    scripts or server-side logic where game objects are linked to specific vignettes
    for visual effects or quest triggers. This function allows developers to query
    the object's associated vignette data without modifying it.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the VignetteData structure which contains information
    about the vignette associated with this GameObject, including its ID, position,
    and scale. Returns nullptr if no vignette is associated with the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const Vignettes::VignetteData* vignette = gameObject->GetVignette();\n\
      if (vignette)\n{\n    // Use vignette data\n    std::cout << \"Vignette ID:\
      \ \" << vignette->ID << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and does not modify the GameObject's state. It
    returns a const pointer to avoid accidental modification of the data structure.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the GameObject actually has a vignette
    associated with it; otherwise, it will return nullptr. Be cautious when using
    this in scenarios where multiple objects may be involved and ensure proper checks
    are performed before dereferencing the returned pointer.
