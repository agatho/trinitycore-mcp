documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a creature is a flight master NPC.
  description: The IsFlightMaster method checks if the provided Creature object represents
    a flight master, which are NPCs that provide flight path services in World of
    Warcraft. This method is typically used during NPC interaction to determine if
    a player can access flight paths through the selected NPC. The check usually involves
    verifying the creature's entry ID against known flight master entries or examining
    specific NPC flags and templates. This functionality is essential for proper quest
    and interaction handling within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature is a flight master, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in NPC Greeting
    code: "void OnGreet(Player* player, Creature* npc)\n{\n    if (sNPCInteractionManager->IsFlightMaster(npc))\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetSession()->SendNPCLoginCSV();\n        // Handle\
      \ flight master specific interaction\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal NPC type definitions and may cache
    results for performance. It's commonly used in conjunction with other NPC interaction
    methods to provide appropriate UI elements or dialogue options based on the NPC
    type.
