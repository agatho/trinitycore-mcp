  signature: float PathGenerator::Dist3DSqr(const int & p1, const int & p2) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the squared 3D distance between two points in a path.
  description: The Dist3DSqr method computes the squared Euclidean distance between
    two points identified by their indices within the path. This implementation avoids
    computing the square root for performance reasons, as squared distances are sufficient
    for many comparison operations. The method assumes both point indices are valid
    and within the bounds of the internal path data structure. In the context of TrinityCore's
    PathGenerator, this is typically used for pathfinding algorithms to evaluate node
    distances without unnecessary computational overhead.
  parameters:
  - name: p1
    description: Index of the first point in the path data structure. Must be a valid
      index within the range of stored points.
  - name: p2
    description: Index of the second point in the path data structure. Must be a valid
      index within the range of stored points.
  returns: A float value representing the squared 3D distance between the two specified
    points. Returns zero if both indices refer to the same point.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate squared distance between two path points
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      // Assume pathGen has been populated with points

      float distSquared = pathGen.Dist3DSqr(0, 5);

      // distSquared now holds the squared distance between point 0 and point 5'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is optimized for performance by avoiding sqrt() computation.
    It's commonly used in pathfinding heuristics where only relative comparisons are
    needed. The indices p1 and p2 must be valid; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided indices are within the valid range of points
    stored in the PathGenerator instance. Using invalid indices may lead to memory
    access violations or incorrect results.
