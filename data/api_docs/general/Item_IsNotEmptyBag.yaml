  method: IsNotEmptyBag
  signature: bool Item::IsNotEmptyBag() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the item is not empty and contains items in its container.
  description: This method determines if an item's container bag is not empty, meaning
    it has items stored inside. It is commonly used to verify that a bag or container
    item has content before performing operations on it. The method returns true when
    the bag contains items, and false when the bag is empty. This functionality is
    essential for game mechanics involving inventory management and item handling
    in World of Warcraft.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item's container bag has items stored inside; returns
    false if the bag is empty or does not contain any items.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);\nif (item && item->IsNotEmptyBag())\
      \ {\n    // Bag contains items\n    std::cout << \"Bag has items\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other inventory-related
    methods to determine bag contents. It may be used in conjunction with GetBagSlot()
    or similar methods to check if a specific container slot has items.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with IsEmptyBag(), which would return
    true when the bag is empty and false when it contains items. Also note that this
    method only applies to bags, not regular items.
