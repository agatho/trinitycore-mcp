  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: HandleSustainedPhase
  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::HandleSustainedPhase()
documentation:
  brief: Manages the sustained combat phase logic for AI-controlled units in TrinityCore.
  description: The HandleSustainedPhase method is responsible for executing the core
    logic that governs how AI-controlled creatures maintain and transition through
    sustained combat states. This includes managing ongoing attack behaviors, handling
    threat distribution, updating combat timers, and ensuring proper engagement with
    targets over extended periods. The method typically integrates with the broader
    CombatAI system to ensure consistent behavior during prolonged fights, particularly
    in scenarios such as boss encounters or scripted combat sequences where continuous
    engagement is required.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat AI Update Loop
    code: "void CreatureAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        combatAIIntegrator.HandleSustainedPhase();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the AI update cycle and should be
    called only when a creature is actively engaged in combat. It assumes that the
    unit has an active target and that combat state management is properly initialized.
  warnings: Improper invocation outside of combat context may lead to undefined behavior
    or performance degradation. Ensure that this method is not called redundantly
    within tight loops without proper condition checks.
