  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::BotPerformanceAnalytics()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the BotPerformanceAnalytics class for tracking
    and analyzing bot performance metrics.
  description: The BotPerformanceAnalytics constructor initializes a new instance
    of the BotPerformanceAnalytics class, setting up internal data structures and
    configurations needed to track various performance metrics related to AI-controlled
    bots in the TrinityCore environment. This method prepares the analytics system
    to collect data on bot behavior, response times, decision-making efficiency, and
    other relevant performance indicators. The initialization process ensures that
    all necessary resources are allocated and that the analytics framework is ready
    to begin collecting real-time performance data from active bots within the game
    world.

  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      // The analytics object is now initialized and ready to track bot performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should be called once during the server startup or when
    the bot analytics system is first enabled. The initialization process may allocate
    memory for tracking buffers and set up internal data structures that persist throughout
    the server's runtime.
