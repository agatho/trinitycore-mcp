documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns a ChatPacketSender for the specified locale.
  description: The operator() method of BroadcastTextBuilder is responsible for creating
    and returning a ChatPacketSender instance that is configured for the given locale.
    This method is typically used in the context of sending broadcast messages to
    players, where the appropriate localization must be applied to ensure the message
    is displayed correctly based on the player's language settings. The returned ChatPacketSender
    can then be used to construct and send chat packets containing localized broadcast
    text. This method does not modify the original BroadcastTextBuilder instance and
    is generally called as part of a chain or sequence of operations that prepare
    and dispatch localized messages.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a ChatPacketSender object configured for the specified locale.
    The caller is responsible for managing the lifetime of this object, typically
    by using it immediately in a send operation or storing it appropriately within
    the scope where it's needed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BroadcastTextBuilder builder;

      ChatPacketSender* sender = builder[LOCALE_en];

      sender->Send();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in conjunction with localization systems within
    TrinityCore to ensure that broadcast messages are properly formatted and displayed
    according to the player's locale settings. It is expected that the BroadcastTextBuilder
    instance has been previously initialized with relevant text data for various locales.
