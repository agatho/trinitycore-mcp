  class: BotProfiler
  method: IntegrateMemoryManager
  signature: void BotProfiler::IntegrateMemoryManager()
documentation:
  brief: Integrates the memory manager with the bot profiler to enable memory usage
    tracking and optimization.
  description: The IntegrateMemoryManager method initializes and connects the memory
    management system with the bot profiler, allowing for real-time monitoring of
    memory allocations and deallocations within the bot subsystem. This integration
    is crucial for identifying memory leaks, optimizing resource usage, and ensuring
    stable performance of AI-controlled bots in the game environment. The method typically
    sets up callback mechanisms or hooks into the memory allocator to track memory
    operations performed by bot instances.

  - title: Basic Integration Usage
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.IntegrateMemoryManager();

      // Memory tracking is now enabled for all bot instances'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during the initialization phase of
    the bot system. The integration process may introduce minimal overhead to memory
    allocation operations, but it's essential for long-term stability and performance
    monitoring of AI bots.
