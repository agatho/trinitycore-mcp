  class: QuestValidation
  method: CheckBreadcrumbQuest
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckBreadcrumbQuest(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player can accept or continue a breadcrumb quest.
  description: The CheckBreadcrumbQuest method evaluates if a given quest meets the
    criteria for a breadcrumb quest, which typically involves tracking progress through
    a series of related objectives. This validation ensures that the quest is properly
    structured and compatible with the player's current state in the game. The method
    checks various conditions such as quest prerequisites, player level requirements,
    and whether the quest has been previously completed or is in an appropriate progression
    state. It is commonly used during quest acceptance or update processes to maintain
    game balance and logical quest flow.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being validated. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player or bot attempting
      to validate the quest. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the quest passes all breadcrumb validation checks and can
    be accepted or continued by the player; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation Check
    code: "if (sQuestValidation->CheckBreadcrumbQuest(quest, player)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Inform\
      \ player that quest cannot be accepted\n    player->SendNotification(\"This\
      \ quest is not available at this time.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (sQuestValidation->CheckBreadcrumbQuest(quest,\
      \ this)) {\n        // Validate that player meets all prerequisites\n      \
      \  if (CanTakeQuest(quest, false)) {\n            // Accept the quest\n    \
      \        AddQuest(quest);\n            SendQuestUpdateAdd(quest);\n        }\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Prevent invalid breadcrumb quest from being accepted\n\
      \        SendQuestFailed(quest);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest acceptance or update events
    to ensure that breadcrumb quests are properly validated before being added to
    the player's quest log. The implementation may involve checking for quest dependencies,
    player progress, and other game state conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that both quest and bot parameters are valid pointers before calling
    this method; passing null values will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method should not be used as a standalone validation but rather integrated
    into broader quest management systems.
