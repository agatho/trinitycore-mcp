  method: OptimizeObjectiveSequence
  signature: void QuestCompletion::OptimizeObjectiveSequence(Player * bot, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the sequence of quest objectives for a player bot based on quest
    requirements and available resources.
  description: The OptimizeObjectiveSequence method reorders or adjusts the sequence
    of objectives within a specified quest for a given player bot. This optimization
    ensures that the bot completes quest objectives in an efficient order, potentially
    reducing travel time and resource consumption. The method considers factors such
    as objective dependencies, location proximity, and available quest items. It is
    typically used in automated quest completion systems where efficiency and logical
    flow are prioritized over traditional quest progression order.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will complete
      the quest. Must be a valid player instance with active quest data.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest to optimize. Must correspond to an
      existing quest in the game database and be currently available to the bot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Optimization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid player instance

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      QuestCompletion::OptimizeObjectiveSequence(myBot, questId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal objective sequence of the specified quest
    for the bot. It does not alter the original quest data in the database but affects
    only the temporary state during quest execution. Performance impact is minimal
    as it operates on cached quest information.
  warnings: Ensure that the player bot has the quest active before calling this method,
    otherwise behavior may be undefined. This method should not be called during critical
    quest progression phases where objective order is strictly enforced by game mechanics.
