documentation:
  brief: Configures the spatial query optimizer with the specified settings
  description: The SetConfig method initializes or updates the configuration parameters
    for the SpatialQueryOptimizer class. This method allows developers to adjust various
    optimization parameters that control how spatial queries are processed within
    the TrinityCore server environment. The configuration affects performance characteristics
    such as query execution speed, memory usage, and accuracy of spatial calculations.
    The optimizer uses these settings to determine the most efficient algorithms for
    handling different types of spatial operations, particularly those involving object
    positioning, collision detection, and area-based queries in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A const reference to an OptimizerConfig object containing all configuration
      parameters for the spatial query optimizer. This includes settings such as maximum
      query depth, memory limits, and algorithm selection preferences that govern
      how spatial operations are executed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Configuration Setup
    code: 'OptimizerConfig config;

      config.maxQueryDepth = 10;

      config.memoryLimitMB = 512;

      config.useAdvancedAlgorithms = true;

      spatialQueryOptimizer.SetConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Tuning Configuration
    code: 'OptimizerConfig config;

      config.maxQueryDepth = 15;

      config.memoryLimitMB = 1024;

      config.useAdvancedAlgorithms = false;

      config.enableCaching = true;

      spatialQueryOptimizer.SetConfig(config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during server initialization or when runtime
    optimization parameters need to be adjusted. The configuration changes take effect
    immediately for subsequent spatial queries, but may not affect ongoing operations.
    It's recommended to set configurations before heavy spatial query loads begin.
  warnings: Modifying the configuration while active spatial queries are running may
    lead to inconsistent behavior or performance degradation. Always ensure that configuration
    updates occur during appropriate maintenance windows or when the system is idle.
