documentation:
  brief: Executes a knockback effect on targets affected by the spell.
  description: The EffectKnockBack method applies a knockback mechanic to target objects,
    pushing them away from the caster based on the spell's power and the target's
    current position. This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell
    effects that require physical displacement of targets. The implementation involves
    calculating the knockback direction and distance based on the spell's parameters
    and applying appropriate movement adjustments to the affected targets.

  notes: This method requires the target to be valid and may involve movement updates
    depending on the spell's context. Implementation details include handling of collision
    detection and movement restrictions.
  warnings: The method should only be called when targets are valid and within the
    spell's range. Improper usage can lead to unexpected behavior or client-side errors.
