  class: BaselineRotationManager
  method: ExecuteBaselineRotation
  signature: bool BaselineRotationManager::ExecuteBaselineRotation(int * bot, int
    * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the baseline rotation logic for a bot targeting a specified unit.
  description: The ExecuteBaselineRotation method performs the core logic of a predefined
    combat rotation for a bot character. It evaluates the current state of the bot
    and its target, then determines and executes appropriate actions based on the
    defined baseline rotation rules. This typically involves checking if abilities
    are ready, managing resource usage (such as mana or energy), and selecting the
    most optimal action according to the rotation sequence. The method returns true
    if an action was successfully executed, and false if no action could be performed
    due to constraints such as cooldowns, insufficient resources, or invalid target
    state. This method is commonly used in AI-driven bot systems within TrinityCore-based
    game servers.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot character's data structure, containing information
      about the bot's current state, abilities, and attributes.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target character's data structure, representing the
      unit the bot is currently targeting for actions.
  returns: Returns true if a rotation action was successfully executed; otherwise
    returns false if no valid action could be performed due to cooldowns, resource
    constraints, or invalid state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ExecuteBaselineRotation
    code: "int botData = 0;\nint targetData = 0;\nBaselineRotationManager rotationManager;\n\
      bool result = rotationManager.ExecuteBaselineRotation(&botData, &targetData);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Action was executed\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No action performed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot and target data structures are properly
    initialized and contain valid information. The implementation may vary depending
    on the specific rotation strategy defined in the baseline configuration.
  warnings: Ensure that both bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent undefined behavior or crashes. Improper handling of these parameters
    can lead to segmentation faults or incorrect AI behavior.
