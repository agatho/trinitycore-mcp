  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateBasicRequirements
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateBasicRequirements(const Quest * quest,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player meets the basic requirements to accept a quest.
  description: The ValidateBasicRequirements method checks if a given player is eligible
    to accept a specific quest based on fundamental criteria such as level requirements,
    race/class restrictions, and quest availability. This validation ensures that
    players cannot accept quests they are not qualified for, maintaining game balance
    and progression integrity. The method typically evaluates the player's current
    level against the quest's minimum required level, verifies that the player meets
    any faction or race prerequisites, and confirms that the quest is not already
    completed or in progress by the player.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs to be validated for acceptance.
      This parameter must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      accept the quest. This parameter must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all basic requirements to accept the quest,
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false indicates that one or more validation
    checks failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateBasicRequirements(quest, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Player can accept the quest\n    player->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Player cannot accept the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"You do not\
      \ meet the requirements for this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateBasicRequirements(quest,\
      \ this)) {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_NOT_READY);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Proceed with normal quest acceptance logic\n\
      \    AddQuest(quest);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before allowing a player to accept a quest,
    and it's part of the broader quest validation system in TrinityCore. It does not
    check for more complex conditions like item requirements or quest-specific flags;
    those are handled by other methods in the QuestValidation class.
  warnings: Ensure that both parameters are valid non-null pointers before calling
    this method to prevent crashes. The method assumes that the quest data is properly
    loaded and initialized in the database.
