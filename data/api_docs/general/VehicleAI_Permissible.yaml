  class: VehicleAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int VehicleAI::Permissible(const Creature * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether this VehicleAI instance can be assigned to a given creature.
  description: 'The Permissible method is used by the TrinityCore AI system to determine
    if a specific VehicleAI implementation should be assigned to a creature. This
    method acts as a filter or selector, allowing the core game engine to decide at
    runtime whether a particular vehicle AI behavior is appropriate for a given NPC.
    The return value indicates the level of permissiveness: positive values suggest
    strong suitability, zero means not suitable, and negative values indicate potential
    conflicts or disapproval. This mechanism supports dynamic AI assignment based
    on creature properties such as type, faction, or other configurable attributes.'
  parameters: []
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating the permissiveness level:

    - Positive value: Strongly recommends assigning this VehicleAI to the creature

    - Zero: Indicates that this VehicleAI should not be assigned to the creature

    - Negative value: Suggests potential conflict or disapproval of assignment'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Permissible Check
    code: "int VehicleAI::Permissible(const Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->Entry\
      \ == 12345) // Example vehicle entry\n        return PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE;\n\
      \    \n    return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI initialization and should be implemented
    efficiently as it may be invoked frequently. The values returned are defined by
    the TrinityCore AI system constants such as PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE, PERMIT_BASE_UNCONDITIONAL,
    and PERMIT_BASE_NO.
