  signature: void GroupScript::~GroupScript()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupScript instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The ~GroupScript destructor is automatically invoked when a GroupScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any resources allocated by the GroupScript instance, including unregistering
    event handlers and releasing internal references. In the context of TrinityCore's
    scripting system, GroupScript objects are typically used to define custom behavior
    for group-related events such as member joins, leaves, or disbands. The destructor
    plays a critical role in preventing memory leaks and maintaining the integrity
    of the script subsystem by ensuring that all registered callbacks are properly
    unregistered before the object is destroyed.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of GroupScript instance
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    GroupScript* script = new GroupScript(\"\
      MyGroupScript\");\n    // ... perform operations with the script ...\n    delete\
      \ script; // Triggers ~GroupScript destructor\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using smart pointers for automatic cleanup
    code: "#include <memory>\n\nvoid ExampleFunction()\n{\n    auto script = std::make_unique<GroupScript>(\"\
      MyGroupScript\");\n    // ... perform operations with the script ...\n    //\
      \ ~GroupScript automatically called when unique_ptr goes out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime and should not be
    invoked manually. It's important to ensure that all event handlers registered
    through this GroupScript are properly unregistered during destruction to prevent
    dangling pointers or access violations. The destructor may perform cleanup operations
    that depend on the TrinityCore core state, so it should only be called when the
    server is in a stable state.
  warnings: Manual invocation of the destructor can lead to undefined behavior and
    memory corruption. Never call ~GroupScript directly unless you're implementing
    custom memory management. Be aware that if GroupScript instances are destroyed
    while group events are still being processed, it could potentially cause race
    conditions or crashes.
