documentation:
  brief: Promotes a backup interrupt target to the main interrupt target in the InterruptManager.
  description: The PromoteBackupToMain method transfers control of interrupt handling
    from a backup target to the primary target within the InterruptManager. This method
    is typically used during interrupt processing when a backup target needs to be
    elevated to the main role, such as when the primary target becomes unavailable
    or when interrupt priorities are reassigned. The operation ensures that interrupt
    events are properly routed to the designated main target while maintaining consistency
    in the interrupt management system. This method does not return any value and
    operates directly on the internal state of the InterruptManager instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'InterruptTarget backupTarget;

      // ... initialize backupTarget ...

      interruptManager.PromoteBackupToMain(backupTarget);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that a backup target has already been set within the
    InterruptManager. The promotion process may involve internal state synchronization
    and should be called only when the backup target is valid and ready to become
    the main interrupt handler.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring a valid backup target may lead to
    undefined behavior or loss of interrupt handling capability. Ensure that the target
    parameter represents a legitimate backup interrupt source before invoking this
    method.
