documentation:
  brief: Initializes the CombatAIIntegrator with a bot reference for combat behavior
    integration
  description: The CombatAIIntegrator constructor method sets up the integration between
    a bot instance and the combat artificial intelligence system. This method prepares
    the bot's combat capabilities by initializing necessary AI components, setting
    up behavior trees, and configuring combat parameters. The method is typically
    called during bot initialization or when transitioning into combat-ready states
    within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that the bot can properly execute
    combat actions such as target selection, spell casting, and movement patterns
    based on its assigned class and role.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the bot instance that will be integrated with the combat
      AI system. This parameter must point to a valid Bot object that has been properly
      initialized within the TrinityCore environment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic CombatAIIntegrator Initialization
    code: 'Bot* myBot = new Bot();

      CombatAIIntegrator aiIntegrator;

      aiIntegrator.CombatAIIntegrator(&myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration within Bot Manager Context
    code: "class BotManager\n{\npublic:\n    void InitializeBotCombatAI(Bot* bot)\n\
      \    {\n        CombatAIIntegrator integrator;\n        integrator.CombatAIIntegrator(&bot);\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot pointer is valid and points to
    an already initialized Bot object. The integration process may involve setting
    up internal AI state machines, registering event handlers, and configuring combat-related
    behavior parameters. Developers should ensure that bots are properly initialized
    before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null or uninitialized bot pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always verify that the bot object is fully constructed and
    valid before passing it to this method. This method does not perform any validation
    of the bot's state, so proper initialization must be handled externally.
