documentation:
  brief: Destroys the World object and cleans up all associated resources.
  description: The ~World destructor is called when a World instance is being destroyed.
    It performs necessary cleanup operations such as shutting down subsystems, releasing
    memory, and ensuring that all active connections and processes are properly terminated.
    This method is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when the object goes out
    of scope or is explicitly deleted. In the context of TrinityCore, this destructor
    ensures that the game world state is cleanly torn down without leaving any dangling
    references or resources allocated in memory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of World object
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    World* world = new World();\n    // ... do something\
      \ with world ...\n    delete world; // ~World() is automatically called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called manually unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to ensure that all subsystems are properly shut down
    before destruction, as this method may rely on other components being valid during
    its execution.
