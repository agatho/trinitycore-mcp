  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: CalculateTankScore
  signature: uint32 LFGRoleDetector::CalculateTankScore(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a tank role score for the specified player based on
    their equipped items and stats.
  description: The CalculateTankScore method evaluates a player's suitability for
    the tank role within the context of LFG (Looking For Group) systems. It analyzes
    various attributes such as armor, stamina, defensive abilities, and equipped gear
    to determine how well-suited the player is to fulfill a tanking role in dungeons
    or raids. This score helps group finders match players with appropriate roles
    based on their character's capabilities. The method does not modify any player
    state but provides a numerical representation of tanking potential that can be
    used for role assignment logic.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the calculated tank score. Higher values indicate
    better suitability for tanking roles, with scores typically ranging from 0 (unsuitable)
    to a maximum determined by the game's internal scoring system based on gear and
    stats.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in LFG Role Assignment
    code: "uint32 tankScore = lfgRoleDetector->CalculateTankScore(player);\nif (tankScore\
      \ > 500)\n{\n    // Assign player to tank role\n    player->SetLfgRole(LFG_ROLE_TANK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the player's current gear and stats at the time of
    calculation. It may not account for temporary buffs or debuffs that could affect
    actual tanking performance in combat. The exact scoring algorithm is internal
    to TrinityCore and may vary between different versions or patches.
  warnings: The returned score should not be used as the sole determinant for role
    assignment without considering other factors like player preferences, group composition,
    and current LFG queue requirements. This method assumes valid player data and
    may produce unexpected results if called on a null or invalid player pointer.
