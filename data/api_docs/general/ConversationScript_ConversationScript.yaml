  class: ConversationScript
  method: ConversationScript
  signature: void ConversationScript::ConversationScript(const char * name)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new conversation script with the specified name.
  description: The ConversationScript constructor initializes a new conversation script
    instance with the provided name. This method sets up the internal state of the
    conversation script, allowing it to be registered and managed by the TrinityCore
    scripting system. The name parameter is used to uniquely identify the conversation
    script within the game world and is typically used for lookup and reference purposes.
    This constructor is part of the base ConversationScript class and should be called
    when creating custom conversation scripts that extend this functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A null-terminated character string that serves as the unique identifier
      for this conversation script. The name must be unique within the scope of registered
      conversation scripts and is used for lookup and management by the TrinityCore
      scripting system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Conversation Script Initialization
    code: "class MyConversationScript : public ConversationScript\n{\npublic:\n  \
      \  MyConversationScript() : ConversationScript(\"MyCustomConversation\")\n \
      \   {\n        // Constructor logic here\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  - title: Extended Conversation Script with Additional Setup
    code: "class QuestGiverConversation : public ConversationScript\n{\npublic:\n\
      \    QuestGiverConversation() : ConversationScript(\"QuestGiverDialogue\")\n\
      \    {\n        // Register conversation events or set up initial state\n  \
      \      // This would typically be followed by additional initialization logic\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called as part of a class inheritance chain
    where a custom conversation script extends the base ConversationScript class.
    Developers should ensure that the name parameter is unique to prevent conflicts
    with other registered scripts. The constructor does not perform any complex operations
    but sets up the fundamental structure needed for the script to be recognized by
    the TrinityCore system.
  warnings: Ensure that the name parameter passed to this constructor is unique across
    all conversation scripts in your module or server, as duplicate names may cause
    unexpected behavior or registration failures. Do not call this constructor directly
    on base ConversationScript instances without proper inheritance.
