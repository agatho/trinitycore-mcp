  method: LoadDungeonMechanics
  signature: void MechanicDatabase::LoadDungeonMechanics()
documentation:
  brief: Loads dungeon mechanic data from the database into memory for use during
    gameplay.
  description: The LoadDungeonMechanics method initializes and populates internal
    data structures with dungeon-specific mechanic information stored in the TrinityCore
    database. This includes loading data such as mechanic types, cooldowns, and interaction
    rules that govern how players interact with various dungeon environments and encounters.
    The method is typically invoked during server startup or database reload operations
    to ensure that all dungeon mechanics are properly initialized before gameplay
    begins. It reads from relevant database tables containing dungeon mechanic definitions
    and caches this information for efficient access during player interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: 'MechanicDatabase db;

      db.LoadDungeonMechanics(); // Called during server startup to load dungeon mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    reloading dungeon data. It performs database queries and loads data into memory,
    so calling it multiple times may result in duplicate entries or performance overhead.
    The method assumes that the database connection is already established and valid.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within high-frequency game loops as it may
    block or cause performance issues. Ensure that all required database tables are
    properly populated before invoking this method, otherwise incomplete mechanic
    data may be loaded.
