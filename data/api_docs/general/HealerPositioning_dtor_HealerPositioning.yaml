documentation:
  brief: Destroys a HealerPositioning instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the HealerPositioning class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources held by the instance. This method
    ensures proper resource deallocation when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this class likely manages
    positioning logic for healer NPCs or players during combat scenarios. The destructor
    may handle cleanup of internal data structures such as pathfinding caches, target
    tracking lists, or temporary positioning calculations. It is automatically invoked
    by the C++ runtime when the object is destroyed and should not be called manually.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of HealerPositioning instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    HealerPositioning healerPos;\n    // ... use\
      \ healerPos ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when healerPos goes\
      \ out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of dynamically allocated HealerPositioning
    code: 'HealerPositioning* healerPtr = new HealerPositioning();

      // ... use healerPtr ...

      delete healerPtr; // Triggers destructor

      healerPtr = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly virtual if the class has virtual functions,
    ensuring proper cleanup of derived classes. It's important to note that this destructor
    does not perform any specific AI logic or positioning calculations - its sole
    purpose is resource cleanup. The implementation should be lightweight and not
    involve complex operations that could block execution threads.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke destructors unless you're implementing custom memory
    management. The destructor assumes all internal resources are properly allocated
    and may cause undefined behavior if called on an already-destroyed object or in
    an invalid state. Avoid calling this destructor directly in normal code flow.
