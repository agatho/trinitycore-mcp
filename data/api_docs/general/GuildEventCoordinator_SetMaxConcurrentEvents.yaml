  class: GuildEventCoordinator
  method: SetMaxConcurrentEvents
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::SetMaxConcurrentEvents(uint32 guildId, uint32
    maxEvents)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum number of concurrent guild events for a specified guild.
  description: The SetMaxConcurrentEvents method configures the maximum number of
    events that can occur simultaneously within a guild. This is used to manage event
    scheduling and prevent resource contention or overflow in guild-based activities
    such as raids, dungeons, or other organized group events. The method updates internal
    tracking structures for the specified guild ID with the new concurrency limit.
    This setting affects how many events can be active at once and may influence event
    queuing behavior when limits are exceeded.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild for which to set the maximum concurrent
      events. Must be a valid guild identifier present in the database.
  - name: maxEvents
    description: Maximum number of concurrent events allowed for the specified guild.
      Value must be a positive integer; typically limited by game mechanics and server
      configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Concurrent Events for Guild
    code: GuildEventCoordinator::SetMaxConcurrentEvents(12345, 3);
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Guild Event Limit Based on Server Configuration
    code: 'uint32 newLimit = sWorld->getIntConfig(CONFIG_GUILD_MAX_CONCURRENT_EVENTS);

      GuildEventCoordinator::SetMaxConcurrentEvents(guildId, newLimit);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal data structures within the GuildEventCoordinator
    class to track concurrency limits per guild. It may be called during server initialization
    or configuration changes. The actual enforcement of these limits is probably handled
    by the event scheduling system when events are created or started.
  warnings: Setting this value too high may lead to performance issues or resource
    exhaustion if many events are scheduled simultaneously. Ensure that the value
    aligns with your server's capacity and intended gameplay mechanics.
