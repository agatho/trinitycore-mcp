  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Gracefully shuts down the bot performance monitoring system, releasing all
    associated resources and stopping active monitoring tasks.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for safely terminating the bot performance
    monitoring functionality within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that all
    active monitoring threads are properly stopped, resources are released, and any
    pending data is flushed or saved before the system transitions into a closed state.
    This method should be called when the performance monitoring subsystem is no longer
    needed or during system shutdown to prevent resource leaks and ensure clean termination
    of bot-related performance tracking activities.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = sBotPerformanceMonitor;\nif (monitor)\n\
      {\n    monitor->Shutdown();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server shutdown or when disabling
    bot performance monitoring features. It's important to ensure that no other threads
    are actively using the monitor before calling Shutdown to avoid potential race
    conditions or undefined behavior.
