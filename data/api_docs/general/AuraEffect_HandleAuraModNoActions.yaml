documentation:
  brief: Applies or removes the no-actions aura effect, preventing the target from
    performing any actions.
  description: The HandleAuraModNoActions method is responsible for managing the application
    and removal of an aura that disables all actions for the affected unit. This aura
    prevents the target from casting spells, attacking, moving, or performing any
    other action that would normally be allowed. The method is called internally by
    the Aura system when an aura with this effect is applied or removed from a unit.
    It uses the provided AuraApplication object to determine the context of the application
    and the mode (apply or remove) to correctly process the effect on the target.
  parameters:
  - name: aurApp
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object that contains information about
      how this aura is applied to the target unit. This includes details such as the
      caster, the application time, and the aura's properties.
  - name: mode
    description: The mode of operation for the aura effect. Typically indicates whether
      the aura is being applied (1) or removed (0). This parameter determines how
      the effect should be processed on the target unit.
  - name: apply
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the aura effect. When true, the no-actions state is enabled; when false, it's
      disabled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura application
    code: "void MyAuraHandler::HandleAuraModNoActions(const AuraApplication* aurApp,\
      \ uint8 mode, bool apply) const {\n    if (apply) {\n        // Disable actions\
      \ for the target\n        aurApp->GetTarget()->SetCanNotMove(true);\n      \
      \  aurApp->GetTarget()->SetCanNotAttack(true);\n    } else {\n        // Re-enable\
      \ actions\n        aurApp->GetTarget()->SetCanNotMove(false);\n        aurApp->GetTarget()->SetCanNotAttack(false);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core aura handling system in TrinityCore and is
    typically invoked by the Aura class when processing aura effects. It's important
    to note that this effect blocks all actions, including movement, casting, and
    attacking, which can significantly impact gameplay for affected units.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to unintended behavior
    where players or NPCs are unable to perform basic actions. Always ensure proper
    cleanup when removing the aura to restore normal functionality.
