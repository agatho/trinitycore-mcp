  class: PassiveAI
  method: PassiveAI
  signature: void PassiveAI::PassiveAI(int * creature, int scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a passive AI behavior for a creature with the specified script
    ID.
  description: The PassiveAI constructor initializes a creature's AI to a passive
    state, typically used for non-aggressive NPCs that do not engage in combat or
    follow complex behaviors. This method sets up the basic AI framework for creatures
    that should remain idle unless triggered by specific events or conditions. The
    implementation likely configures internal flags and states to ensure the creature
    behaves according to passive AI rules, such as ignoring aggro, not pursuing targets,
    and maintaining a neutral stance. This is commonly used for quest-related NPCs,
    vendors, or stationary entities in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the creature object that will be initialized with passive
      AI behavior. This parameter represents the target NPC whose AI state will be
      modified.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Unique identifier for the script associated with this passive AI
      instance. Used to link the creature to specific scripted behaviors or events
      within the TrinityCore framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Passive AI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // Get a creature reference

      uint32 scriptId = 12345;

      PassiveAI passiveAI;

      passiveAI.PassiveAI(&myCreature, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during creature creation or initialization.
    The PassiveAI implementation may rely on TrinityCore's AI system to properly configure
    the creature's behavior state. Developers should ensure that the creature pointer
    is valid and that the script ID corresponds to an existing script in the database.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of this method with invalid creature pointers can lead
    to memory access violations or undefined behavior. Ensure that the scriptId parameter
    references a valid script before calling this method, as invalid script IDs may
    cause runtime errors or unexpected AI behavior.
