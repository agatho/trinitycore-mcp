  brief: Generates maelstrom resource amount for the MaelstromResource object
  description: The GenerateMaelstrom method is responsible for creating or increasing
    the maelstrom resource value within a MaelstromResource object. This method typically
    represents the core functionality of resource generation in the context of World
    of Warcraft's Maelstrom mechanic, which is often associated with elemental magic
    and abilities such as those used by shaman class players. The method accepts an
    amount parameter that specifies how much maelstrom resource should be generated.
    It is commonly invoked during gameplay events like spell casting, ability usage,
    or passive resource regeneration.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: The quantity of maelstrom resource to generate. This value must be
      a positive integer representing the amount of resource to add to the current
      maelstrom pool.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'MaelstromResource resource;

      resource.GenerateMaelstrom(50); // Generates 50 units of maelstrom'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Spell Effect Context
    code: "void OnSpellHit(Unit* caster, SpellInfo const* spellInfo) {\n    if (spellInfo->Id\
      \ == 12345) { // Example shaman spell\n        MaelstromResource* maelstrom\
      \ = caster->GetMaelstromResource();\n        if (maelstrom) {\n            maelstrom->GenerateMaelstrom(25);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal state variables of the MaelstromResource
    class, and may trigger events or callbacks related to resource changes. It should
    be called only when appropriate game conditions are met, such as during spell
    execution or passive regeneration ticks.
  warnings: Ensure that the amount parameter is non-negative; negative values might
    cause unexpected behavior in resource management systems. This method does not
    validate if the resulting maelstrom value exceeds maximum limits, which may need
    to be handled by calling code.
