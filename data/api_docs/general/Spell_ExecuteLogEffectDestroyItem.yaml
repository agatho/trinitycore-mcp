  brief: Logs the destruction of an item as part of a spell effect
  description: The ExecuteLogEffectDestroyItem method is responsible for recording
    the destruction of a specific item entry when it is consumed or destroyed as part
    of a spell's effect execution. This method typically gets invoked during spell
    processing to ensure proper logging and tracking of item consumption, which is
    important for achievements, quest progress, and game state management. The method
    takes an effect index and an item entry ID to determine what item was destroyed
    and how it relates to the spell's effect.
  parameters:
  - name: effect
    description: The index of the spell effect that caused the item destruction. This
      determines which effect in the spell triggered the item loss.
  - name: entry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the item being destroyed. This
      corresponds to the item's template entry in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Destroying a consumable item during spell effect
    code: "void Spell::ExecuteLogEffectDestroyItem(int effect, uint32 entry)\n{\n\
      \    // Log destruction of item with entry ID '12345' as part of spell effect\
      \ 0\n    sLog->outString(\"Spell %u destroyed item %u (effect %d)\", m_spellInfo->Id,\
      \ entry, effect);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the spell system when an item
    is consumed as part of a spell's effect. It may be used in conjunction with other
    logging or event systems to track item usage and destruction for gameplay purposes.
