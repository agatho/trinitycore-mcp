  class: Conversation
  method: GetOwnerGUID
  signature: int Conversation::GetOwnerGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the conversation's owner player.
  description: The GetOwnerGUID method returns the globally unique identifier of the
    player who owns or initiated the conversation. This GUID is used internally by
    TrinityCore to track and manage conversation ownership, particularly in relation
    to quest systems and player interactions. The returned value represents a 32-bit
    integer that uniquely identifies the owning player within the game world context.
    This method does not perform any validation on the owner's existence or validity,
    so callers should ensure the conversation object is valid before invoking this
    method.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the conversation's owner player. If
    the conversation has no owner, it may return 0 or a default invalid value depending
    on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve owner GUID
    code: "Conversation* conv = sObjectMgr->GetConversation(12345);\nif (conv)\n{\n\
      \    int ownerGUID = conv->GetOwnerGUID();\n    if (ownerGUID != 0)\n    {\n\
      \        // Use the owner GUID for further operations\n        Player* player\
      \ = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(ownerGUID));\n\
      \        if (player)\n        {\n            // Proceed with player-specific\
      \ logic\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other conversation-related
    APIs to manage quest progression and player interaction. The returned GUID should
    be treated as an opaque identifier for internal use within the TrinityCore framework.
