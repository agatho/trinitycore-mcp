  method: GetEventCount
  signature: uint64 AuctionEventBus::GetEventCount(AuctionEventType type) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of auction events of a specified type currently stored
    in the auction event bus.
  description: The GetEventCount method retrieves the number of auction events that
    match the provided AuctionEventType. This method is used to monitor or query the
    current state of auction events within the system, which can be useful for debugging,
    performance monitoring, or determining how many events are pending processing.
    The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call from any thread.
    It provides a quick way to assess event volume without iterating through all stored
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the number of auction events of the specified
    type currently present in the AuctionEventBus. Returns zero if no events of that
    type exist or if the event type is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve count of all item auction events
    code: uint64 itemCount = auctionEventBus.GetEventCount(AuctionEventType::ITEM_AUCTION);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for pending auction events before processing
    code: "if (auctionEventBus.GetEventCount(AuctionEventType::BID_PLACED) > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Process bid events\n    ProcessPendingAuctions();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a simple lookup operation and is generally fast. It's
    recommended to cache the result if the count is needed multiple times in quick
    succession, as frequent calls may not be optimal for performance under high load
    conditions.
