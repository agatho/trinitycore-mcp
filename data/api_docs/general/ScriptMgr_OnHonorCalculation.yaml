documentation:
  brief: Modifies the honor points calculation for a player based on level and multiplier.
  description: The OnHonorCalculation method is a hook in the ScriptMgr class that
    allows custom scripts to modify the amount of honor points a player receives.
    This method is called during honor point calculations, typically after a player
    kills another player or completes certain PvP-related activities. The method takes
    the base honor value by reference, allowing scripts to modify it directly. It
    also receives the player's level and a multiplier that can be used to scale the
    honor calculation. Scripts can use this hook to implement custom PvP balancing,
    honor point scaling, or other game mechanics adjustments.
  parameters:
  - name: honor
    description: Reference to the base honor points value that will be modified by
      scripts. This value is passed in and can be adjusted directly by implementing
      scripts.
  - name: level
    description: The level of the player involved in the honor calculation. Used to
      determine appropriate scaling or adjustments based on player progression.
  - name: multiplier
    description: A floating-point multiplier that affects the final honor calculation.
      This value can be used to scale honor points up or down based on game rules
      or conditions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Honor Multiplier Adjustment
    code: "void OnHonorCalculation(float& honor, uint8 level, float multiplier)\n\
      {\n    // Increase honor by 20% for players above level 60\n    if (level >\
      \ 60)\n        honor *= 1.2f;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Honor Scaling Based on Level
    code: "void OnHonorCalculation(float& honor, uint8 level, float multiplier)\n\
      {\n    // Scale honor based on player level\n    if (level < 10)\n        honor\
      \ *= 0.5f;  // Reduce honor for low-level players\n    else if (level >= 70)\n\
      \        honor *= 1.5f;  // Increase honor for high-level players\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during PvP-related events and may be invoked multiple
    times per event depending on the game logic. It's important to note that modifications
    made to the honor value are applied directly, so scripts should ensure they're
    not causing unintended behavior or exploits. The method is part of TrinityCore's
    scripting system and requires proper script registration to take effect.
  warnings: Modifying the honor value can significantly impact player progression
    and game balance. Scripts should be carefully tested to avoid creating unfair
    advantages or disadvantages. Be cautious when multiplying values, as this could
    lead to very large numbers that may cause overflow issues in the client or server.
