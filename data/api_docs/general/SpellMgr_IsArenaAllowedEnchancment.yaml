  signature: bool SpellMgr::IsArenaAllowedEnchancment(uint32 ench_id) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified enchantment is allowed in arena combat.
  description: This method determines whether a given enchantment ID is permitted
    for use in arena battlegrounds. It evaluates the enchantment against internal
    restrictions and rules that govern what items and enhancements are allowed during
    competitive arena matches. The check typically involves verifying that the enchantment
    does not provide unfair advantages or violates arena-specific game mechanics.
    This function is crucial for maintaining balance and fairness in PvP environments
    where certain item enhancements are restricted.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified enchantment ID is allowed in arena combat,
    false otherwise. The method will return false for any enchantment that is explicitly
    banned or restricted in arena settings, including those that might provide excessive
    stat boosts or violate PvP balance rules.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an enchantment is allowed in arena
    code: "uint32 enchantId = 3210; // Example enchantment ID\nif (sSpellMgr->IsArenaAllowedEnchancment(enchantId))\
      \ {\n    // Enchantment is allowed in arena\n    printf(\"Enchantment %u is\
      \ allowed in arena\\n\", enchantId);\n} else {\n    // Enchantment is not allowed\
      \ in arena\n    printf(\"Enchantment %u is NOT allowed in arena\\n\", enchantId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal databases or configuration files that
    define which enchantments are banned in arenas. The implementation may cache results
    for performance reasons, and the list of restricted enchantments could be updated
    with game patches. Developers should note that this check is typically performed
    during item validation when players attempt to equip items with enchantments in
    arena environments.
  warnings: This method does not validate the existence of the enchantment ID itself
    - it only checks if a given ID is allowed in arenas. If an invalid or non-existent
    enchantment ID is passed, the behavior depends on how the underlying system handles
    such cases. Always ensure that enchantment IDs are valid before calling this function
    to avoid unexpected results.
