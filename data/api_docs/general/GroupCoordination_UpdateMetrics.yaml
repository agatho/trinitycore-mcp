  class: GroupCoordination
  method: UpdateMetrics
  signature: void GroupCoordination::UpdateMetrics()
documentation:
  brief: Updates group coordination metrics including member counts, roles, and synchronization
    status.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recalculating and refreshing
    internal statistics related to group coordination within the TrinityCore framework.
    This includes tracking the number of active members, their roles (lead, assistant,
    etc.), and ensuring that all group-related synchronization data is up-to-date.
    The method typically gets invoked during group state changes such as member joins,
    leaves, or role assignments. It plays a crucial role in maintaining accurate group
    information for features like loot distribution, raid management, and player coordination
    systems.

  - title: Basic Usage in Group Management
    code: "void HandleGroupUpdate(Group* group)\n{\n    if (group)\n    {\n      \
      \  group->GetGroupCoordination()->UpdateMetrics();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger internal callbacks or notifications to other subsystems
    that depend on accurate group metrics. It's typically called automatically by
    the core group management system when significant changes occur, but can also
    be invoked manually for forced updates.
