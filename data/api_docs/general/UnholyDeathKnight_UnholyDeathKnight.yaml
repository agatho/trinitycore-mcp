  method: UnholyDeathKnight
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnight::UnholyDeathKnight(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new UnholyDeathKnight AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The UnholyDeathKnight constructor initializes a new instance of the
    UnholyDeathKnight AI class, associating it with a specific Player object. This
    method sets up the AI behavior for an Unholy Death Knight character within the
    TrinityCore framework. The constructor typically configures the bot's abilities,
    spell usage patterns, and combat strategies specific to the Unholy Death Knight
    specialization. It prepares the AI to function as a controlled player unit in
    various game scenarios such as PvP, PvE, or scripted events.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object that represents the Unholy Death Knight
      AI bot. This parameter must be a valid pointer to an existing Player instance;
      passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UnholyDeathKnight Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = new Player();

      UnholyDeathKnight unholyDK(myBot);

      // The AI is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Existing Player Instance
    code: "Player* existingPlayer = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(12345));\n\
      if (existingPlayer)\n{\n    UnholyDeathKnight unholyDK(existingPlayer);\n  \
      \  // AI bot initialized with existing player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the creation or initialization
    phase of an AI bot. The Player object passed must be properly constructed and
    valid before being used to initialize the UnholyDeathKnight AI. The AI implementation
    may require additional setup steps after construction, such as initializing spell
    caches or behavior trees.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the 'bot' parameter will likely cause crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the Player object is fully initialized and
    valid before passing it to this constructor. This method does not perform any
    validation on the Player object's class or specialization, so callers must ensure
    it represents a valid Unholy Death Knight.
