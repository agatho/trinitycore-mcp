  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: AdaptTrackingStrategy
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::AdaptTrackingStrategy(Player * bot, const ObjectiveState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts the objective tracking strategy for a player based on their current
    state.
  description: The AdaptTrackingStrategy method modifies how objectives are tracked
    for a given player, adjusting the tracking behavior according to the provided
    objective state. This method is typically used in AI or quest management systems
    to dynamically adapt the tracking of objectives such as quests, achievements,
    or other in-game goals based on the player's current progress or status. The strategy
    adjustment may involve enabling/disabling certain tracking features, changing
    priority levels, or modifying how objectives are displayed or updated in the player's
    interface.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for which the tracking strategy is being
      adapted. This represents the target player whose objective tracking behavior
      will be modified.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to an ObjectiveState object that defines the current state
      of objectives. This structure contains information about active, completed,
      or failed objectives and influences how the tracking strategy is adjusted for
      the specified player.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "void MyAI::Update(Player* bot)\n{\n    ObjectiveState state = GetPlayerObjectiveState(bot);\n\
      \    objectiveTracker->AdaptTrackingStrategy(bot, state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic tracking based on quest progression
    code: "void QuestManager::OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n\
      \    ObjectiveState state;\n    state.AddCompletedQuest(questId);\n    objectiveTracker->AdaptTrackingStrategy(player,\
      \ state);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger system that manages player objectives
    and their visual representation in the game UI. It may interact with internal
    tracking mechanisms such as quest log updates, objective completion checks, or
    UI refresh routines.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. The ObjectiveState must accurately reflect
    the player's current state to ensure proper strategy adaptation.
