  class: Battlefield
  method: GetGroupPlayer
  signature: Group * Battlefield::GetGroupPlayer(int guid, int TeamId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the group associated with a specific player GUID and team ID within
    the battlefield.
  description: The GetGroupPlayer method is used to retrieve the Group object that
    contains a player identified by their global unique identifier (GUID) and belonging
    to a specific team within a battlefield. This method is typically utilized in
    battleground and battlefield systems to manage player assignments, group formations,
    and team-based gameplay mechanics. It allows the system to quickly locate which
    group a particular player belongs to based on their GUID and team ID, facilitating
    operations such as team balancing, objective tracking, and reward distribution.
    The method assumes that the player exists within the battlefield context and that
    the specified GUID and TeamId combination is valid.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose group is
      to be retrieved. This value uniquely identifies a specific player instance in
      the game world.
  - name: TeamId
    description: The team identifier indicating which team the player belongs to.
      Typically 0 for Alliance and 1 for Horde, though other values may be used depending
      on the battlefield implementation.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Group object that contains the specified player,
    or NULL if no such group exists or if the player is not found in the current battlefield
    context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve a player's group
    code: "Group* playerGroup = battlefield->GetGroupPlayer(123456, 0);\nif (playerGroup\
      \ != NULL)\n{\n    // Player is in a valid group\n    sLog->outString(\"Player\
      \ found in group %u\", playerGroup->GetId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player not\
      \ found or not in any group\n    sLog->outString(\"Player not found in any group\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the retrieved group for team-based operations
    code: "Group* playerGroup = battlefield->GetGroupPlayer(playerGUID, playerTeam);\n\
      if (playerGroup != NULL)\n{\n    // Perform actions based on group membership\n\
      \    uint32 groupId = playerGroup->GetId();\n    uint32 groupSize = playerGroup->GetMembersCount();\n\
      \    // Example: Update team score or send message to group\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in battleground and battlefield systems where
    players are organized into groups for team-based gameplay. The implementation
    likely relies on internal data structures that map player GUIDs to their respective
    groups, making it efficient for frequent lookups during gameplay events.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID and TeamId values are valid and correspond
    to existing players in the battlefield context; otherwise, the method will return
    NULL. This function should not be called outside of a valid battlefield environment
    where group membership is tracked.
