documentation:
  brief: Completes a timed quest by satisfying its requirements
  description: This method handles the completion of timed quests by checking if the
    player has met all required conditions for the quest. It verifies that the quest's
    time-based requirements are satisfied, including any time limits or specific objectives
    needed to complete the quest. The method returns true if the quest is successfully
    completed and false otherwise. This functionality is essential for maintaining
    proper quest progression and ensuring players can progress through timed quest
    content.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that contains the timed requirements
      to be satisfied
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to display messages related to quest
      completion
  returns: Returns true if the quest requirements are successfully satisfied, false
    otherwise. The method will return false if the player does not meet the required
    conditions or if the quest is not timed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      bool success = player->SatisfyQuestTimed(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "Player* player = GetPlayer();\nQuest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (player->SatisfyQuestTimed(quest, false)) {\n    // Quest completed successfully\n\
      \    player->RemoveQuest(quest);\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest not completed\n  \
      \  // Handle failure case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with quest completion logic
    and should be called after verifying that all quest requirements are met. It's
    important to note that this method only applies to timed quests, not regular quests.
    The implementation may involve checking time-based conditions, objectives, or
    other specific requirements.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper verification
    of quest requirements. Calling it without meeting the necessary conditions can
    lead to incorrect quest completion and potentially cause game mechanics issues.
    Also note that this method may not work properly if the player is not in a valid
    state for quest completion.
