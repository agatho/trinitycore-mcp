  class: AreaTrigger
  method: GetScriptId
  signature: uint32 AreaTrigger::GetScriptId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the script identifier associated with this area trigger.
  description: The GetScriptId method returns the unique script identifier assigned
    to an AreaTrigger instance. This identifier is used by the TrinityCore scripting
    system to determine which custom scripts or behaviors should be applied to the
    area trigger. The script ID typically corresponds to entries in the `area_trigger_scripts`
    database table or is set during the area trigger's creation or loading process.
    This method provides access to the script configuration that governs how the area
    trigger behaves when activated by players or other game entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the script identifier assigned to this area
    trigger. A value of 0 typically indicates no script is associated with the area
    trigger, while non-zero values correspond to registered script entries in the
    database or script system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Script ID
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume a valid AreaTrigger pointer\nuint32\
      \ scriptId = trigger->GetScriptId();\nif (scriptId != 0)\n{\n    // The area\
      \ trigger has an associated script\n    sLog->outString(\"Area Trigger %u has\
      \ script ID: %u\", trigger->GetGUIDLow(), scriptId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Script ID for Conditional Logic
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nuint32 scriptId = trigger->GetScriptId();\n\
      switch (scriptId)\n{\n    case 12345:\n        // Handle specific script behavior\n\
      \        break;\n    case 12346:\n        // Handle another script behavior\n\
      \        break;\n    default:\n        // Default behavior for unscripted triggers\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with the scripting system to
    enable custom behaviors for area triggers. The returned script ID should match
    an entry in the database or be registered through the script manager. Performance-wise,
    this is a simple getter method and does not involve any heavy computation or database
    access.
  warnings: Ensure that the AreaTrigger object is valid before calling this method,
    as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that script IDs are not guaranteed to be unique across different types of triggers;
    they are only unique within the context of the script system.
