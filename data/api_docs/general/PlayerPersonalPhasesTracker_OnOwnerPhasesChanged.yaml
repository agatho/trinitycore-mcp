documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's personal phase tracking when the owner's phases change
  description: The OnOwnerPhasesChanged method is responsible for synchronizing a
    player's personal phase state with changes to the owner object's active phases.
    This method is typically invoked when the owner (such as a player or creature)
    enters or exits specific game phases, ensuring that the player's phase tracking
    remains consistent with the current world state. The method handles internal updates
    to phase masks and may trigger related events or notifications to maintain synchronization
    across the game world.

  - title: Basic usage in phase change handler
    code: "void PhaseChangeHandler::HandlePhaseUpdate(Player* player, uint32 newPhaseMask)\n\
      {\n    if (player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker())\n    {\n        player->GetPersonalPhasesTracker()->OnOwnerPhasesChanged(player);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    phase changes occur. Developers should not need to call this directly unless implementing
    custom phase tracking logic. The method may trigger additional internal updates
    to player state and phase-related systems.
