documentation:
  brief: Destroys the WheatyExceptionReport instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the WheatyExceptionReport class is responsible for
    cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory or system resources that were used
    during the exception reporting process. This method ensures proper resource deallocation
    when an instance of WheatyExceptionReport goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore, this class is typically used to capture and report
    detailed information about crashes or exceptions that occur within the game server,
    making it essential for debugging and maintaining server stability. The destructor
    performs cleanup operations such as releasing memory buffers, closing file handles
    if any were opened, and ensuring no dangling pointers remain after the object
    is destroyed.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of WheatyExceptionReport instance
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport report;

      // ... some operations that might cause an exception ...

      // Destructor automatically called here when report goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of WheatyExceptionReport object
    code: 'WheatyExceptionReport* report = new WheatyExceptionReport();

      // ... perform operations ...

      delete report; // Destructor called here'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked by the C++ runtime when an object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. Developers should not manually call
    this destructor unless implementing custom memory management patterns. The destruction
    process may involve writing crash logs to disk, which could have performance implications
    if called frequently during high-load server operations.
  warnings: Do not call this destructor directly unless you are implementing a custom
    memory manager. The destructor assumes that all resources allocated during the
    object's lifetime have been properly managed and will attempt to release them.
    If the object was partially constructed or in an invalid state, calling the destructor
    may lead to undefined behavior.
