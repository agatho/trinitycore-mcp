  class: CombatBehaviorIntegration
  method: IsResourceLow
  signature: bool CombatBehaviorIntegration::IsResourceLow()
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the current unit's resource level is below a defined threshold
    for combat behavior decisions.
  description: The IsResourceLow method evaluates the current resource level (such
    as mana, energy, or rage) of the unit associated with this CombatBehaviorIntegration
    instance and compares it against a predefined low-resource threshold. This method
    is typically used by AI logic to make tactical decisions, such as whether to avoid
    using high-cost abilities or switch to defensive behaviors. The evaluation considers
    the unit's current resource amount relative to its maximum possible resource value
    and returns true if the current level falls below the configured threshold, indicating
    that the unit is in a low-resource state. This method may be called during combat
    decision-making loops to dynamically adjust AI behavior based on available resources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's current resource level is below the defined
    low-resource threshold; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Decision
    code: "if (combatBehavior->IsResourceLow()) {\n    // Switch to defensive stance\
      \ or use low-cost abilities\n    unit->SetReactState(REACT_DEFENSIVE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Ability Usage Based on Resource
    code: "if (!combatBehavior->IsResourceLow()) {\n    // Use high-cost ability\n\
      \    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_HIGH_COST_ABILITY, true);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Use low-cost alternative\n    unit->CastSpell(target, SPELL_LOW_COST_ABILITY,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal resource tracking mechanisms within
    the TrinityCore AI system. It may cache its result for performance reasons during
    a single decision cycle to avoid repeated calculations. The exact threshold value
    used for determining 'low' resource levels is typically configurable per unit
    type or behavior profile.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called in contexts where resource values
    might be inconsistent or uninitialized, as it could lead to incorrect AI decisions.
    Also note that the definition of 'low resource' may vary between different types
    of units (e.g., mana for casters vs. rage for warriors).
