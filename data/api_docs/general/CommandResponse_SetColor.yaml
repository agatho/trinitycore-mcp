documentation:
  brief: Sets the color of the command response for client display
  description: The SetColor method configures the visual color of a command response
    message that will be sent to the player's client. This allows command handlers
    to provide visual feedback or categorize responses with different colors. The
    color parameter is typically a hexadecimal value representing an RGB color in
    the format 0xRRGGBB. This method returns a reference to the CommandResponse object
    to enable method chaining for fluent interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the CommandResponse object, enabling method chaining for
    fluent interface patterns.
  examples:
  - title: Setting Response Color to Green
    code: ChatHandler->SendSysMessage("Operation successful").SetColor(0x00FF00);
    language: cpp
  - title: Fluent Interface with Multiple Operations
    code: CommandResponse response = CommandResponse().SetMessage("Error occurred").SetColor(0xFF0000).SetType(COMMAND_RESPONSE_TYPE_ERROR);
    language: cpp
  notes: In TrinityCore, command response colors are typically used for visual distinction
    between success, error, and warning messages. The color values should be in standard
    RGB hex format (0xRRGGBB). This method is commonly used in command handlers to
    provide better user experience through visual feedback.
