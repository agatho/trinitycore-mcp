  class: CraftingOrderNpcCustomer
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void CraftingOrderNpcCustomer::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player
    * owner, const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes creation data for a crafting order NPC customer to a byte buffer for
    network transmission.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the state and properties of a CraftingOrderNpcCustomer
    object into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to clients. This
    method is typically invoked when a crafting order NPC customer needs to be created
    or updated in the game world, ensuring that all relevant data such as GUID, position,
    faction, and other NPC-specific attributes are correctly encoded. It plays a crucial
    role in the synchronization of crafting order NPCs between the server and client,
    enabling players to interact with these NPCs seamlessly. The method requires both
    an owner and receiver player context to determine appropriate visibility and interaction
    permissions for the NPC.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: The ByteBuffer where the serialized NPC creation data will be written.
      This buffer is used to construct the packet sent to clients.
  - name: owner
    description: The Player object representing the owner of the crafting order. Used
      to determine ownership context and permissions for the NPC.
  - name: receiver
    description: The Player object representing the receiver or target player for
      the crafting order. Determines visibility and interaction scope for the NPC.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...; // Get owner player

      Player* receiver = ...; // Get receiver player

      CraftingOrderNpcCustomer customer;

      customer.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet serialization system and
    should only be called during NPC creation or update events. Ensure that both owner
    and receiver players are valid before calling to prevent undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of player contexts may result in incorrect visibility
    or interaction permissions for the crafting order NPC. Always validate input parameters
    before invoking this method.
