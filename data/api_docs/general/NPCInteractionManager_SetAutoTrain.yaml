  signature: void NPCInteractionManager::SetAutoTrain(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables automatic training for an NPC interaction.
  description: The SetAutoTrain method configures whether an NPC should automatically
    train the player's skills and abilities when interacting with them. This functionality
    is commonly used in quest systems or NPC dialogue trees where the player can choose
    to have their character's skills trained automatically without manual intervention.
    The method modifies internal state flags within the NPCInteractionManager class
    that control this behavior during NPC interactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto Train
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionManager = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionManager->SetAutoTrain(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto Train
    code: 'NPCInteractionManager* interactionManager = player->GetNPCInteractionManager();

      interactionManager->SetAutoTrain(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly perform training actions; it only sets a flag
    that determines whether automatic training will occur during subsequent NPC interactions.
    The actual training process is handled by other systems within the TrinityCore
    framework.
  warnings: Setting auto train to true may bypass certain quest requirements or player
    choice mechanics, so use with caution in quest-specific scenarios where manual
    training is expected.
