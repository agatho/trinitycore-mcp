  signature: void BotLifecycleMgr::UpdateZonePopulationInDatabase(uint32 zoneId, uint32
    currentBots)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the bot population count for a specified zone in the database.
  description: The UpdateZonePopulationInDatabase method is responsible for persisting
    the current number of bots active within a specific game zone to the database.
    This ensures that the server maintains accurate records of bot distribution across
    zones, which can be used for various purposes such as balancing, analytics, or
    administrative oversight. The method takes a zone identifier and the current count
    of bots in that zone, then performs an update operation on the relevant database
    table. It is typically invoked during periodic updates or when bot counts change
    significantly within a zone.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the game zone for which the bot population
      is being updated. This value corresponds to the ZoneID used internally by TrinityCore
      and must represent a valid zone in the game world.
  - name: currentBots
    description: The current number of bots present in the specified zone. This value
      should be a non-negative integer representing the active bot count at the time
      of the update.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Bot Population for a Zone
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->UpdateZonePopulationInDatabase(1234, 50);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a database write operation and may have performance
    implications if called frequently. It is recommended to batch updates or call
    this method only when significant changes occur in bot population.
