  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordCpuUsage
  signature: void BotPerformanceMonitor::RecordCpuUsage(float cpuPercent)
documentation:
  brief: Records the CPU usage percentage for bot performance monitoring.
  description: The RecordCpuUsage method captures and stores the current CPU utilization
    percentage of the game server or specific bot processes. This functionality is
    essential for tracking system performance and identifying potential bottlenecks
    in bot operations within the TrinityCore environment. The recorded data can be
    used for optimization, load balancing, or debugging purposes. The method does
    not perform any validation on the input value but assumes it represents a valid
    percentage between 0 and 100.
  parameters:
  - name: cpuPercent
    description: The CPU usage percentage to record. Expected to be a floating-point
      value between 0.0 and 100.0, where 0.0 indicates no CPU usage and 100.0 indicates
      full CPU utilization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;

      monitor.RecordCpuUsage(45.3f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Recording CPU Usage in a Loop
    code: "BotPerformanceMonitor monitor;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    float\
      \ cpuUsage = GetSystemCpuUsage();\n    monitor.RecordCpuUsage(cpuUsage);\n \
      \   std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by internal performance monitoring systems
    or bot management modules. It may store data in an internal buffer or log file
    depending on the implementation. The method is designed to be lightweight and
    non-blocking, ensuring minimal impact on ongoing game operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the cpuPercent value passed to this method is within valid
    bounds (0.0 to 100.0) to avoid unexpected behavior in downstream processing or
    logging systems. Passing negative values or values exceeding 100 may lead to incorrect
    performance metrics.
