documentation:
  brief: Exits the current vehicle if the unit is currently in one.
  description: This method allows a Unit (such as a player or creature) to exit its
    current vehicle. It is typically used when the unit needs to leave a vehicle,
    either due to combat situations, movement restrictions, or when the vehicle is
    being removed from the game world. The method handles the necessary cleanup of
    vehicle-related data and ensures that the unit returns to normal state after exiting.
    This function is commonly called during vehicle-related events or when a unit's
    vehicle status changes.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = GetPlayer();

      player->ExitVehicle();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the unit is actually inside a vehicle.
    Calling it on units not in vehicles may result in undefined behavior or errors.
    The method internally manages vehicle state changes and ensures proper cleanup
    of associated data.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the unit is in a vehicle can
    lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the unit has an active vehicle
    before calling this method.
