documentation:
  brief: Initializes and starts the worker threads for the bot database connection
    pool.
  description: The StartWorkerThreads method initializes and launches the background
    worker threads responsible for managing database connections within the BotDatabasePool.
    This method is typically called during system initialization to ensure that the
    database connection pool has active threads ready to handle asynchronous database
    operations. The worker threads will process queued database requests and maintain
    connection health. This method should only be called once during the lifetime
    of the application, as subsequent calls may result in undefined behavior or resource
    leaks.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotDatabasePool& pool = BotDatabasePool::Instance();

      pool.StartWorkerThreads();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during server startup or when the bot system
    is initialized. It's important to ensure that this method is called before any
    database operations are performed through the pool. The worker threads created
    by this method will continue running until the application shuts down or the pool
    is explicitly destroyed.
  warnings: Calling StartWorkerThreads multiple times without properly shutting down
    previous worker threads may lead to resource leaks or thread contention issues.
    This method should only be called once per pool instance during the application
    lifecycle.
