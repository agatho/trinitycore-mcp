  brief: Removes inactive dungeon instances from memory to free up resources and maintain
    performance.
  description: The CleanupInactiveDungeons method is responsible for identifying and
    removing dungeon instances that have been inactive for a specified period. In
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment, this function helps manage server
    resources by cleaning up old or abandoned dungeon encounters that are no longer
    needed. It typically checks the activity status of each dungeon instance, such
    as whether players have left or the dungeon has been completed, and then safely
    destroys those that meet the inactivity criteria. This method is crucial for maintaining
    optimal server performance and preventing memory leaks from stale dungeon data.

    code: 'DungeonBehavior dungeonBehavior;

      dungeonBehavior.CleanupInactiveDungeons();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the server's maintenance
    loop or triggered automatically when memory thresholds are exceeded. It may also
    be invoked manually during server shutdown procedures to ensure clean resource
    cleanup.
