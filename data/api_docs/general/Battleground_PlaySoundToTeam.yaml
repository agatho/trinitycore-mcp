  method: PlaySoundToTeam
  signature: void Battleground::PlaySoundToTeam(int SoundID, int team)
documentation:
  brief: Plays a sound effect to all players on a specified team within the battleground.
  description: The PlaySoundToTeam method sends a sound event to all players belonging
    to a specific team in the battleground. This is commonly used for announcing game
    events such as flag captures, wins, or other significant moments. The method takes
    a sound identifier and a team ID, where the team ID typically corresponds to either
    Alliances (0) or Horrors (1). It does not return any value and operates synchronously
    within the battleground context.
  parameters:
  - name: SoundID
    description: The unique identifier of the sound effect to play. This value maps
      to an entry in the game's sound database.
  - name: team
    description: The team ID to which the sound should be sent. Typically 0 for Alliance
      and 1 for Horde.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Play Flag Capture Sound to Horde Team
    code: bg->PlaySoundToTeam(8562, 1); // Plays a flag capture sound to the Horde
      team
    language: cpp
  - title: Announce Victory Sound to Both Teams
    code: 'bg->PlaySoundToTeam(8500, 0); // Play victory sound to Alliance

      bg->PlaySoundToTeam(8500, 1); // Play victory sound to Horde'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during battleground events like capture,
    win/lose conditions, or when a player completes an objective. The SoundID must
    be valid and registered in the game's sound database; otherwise, no sound will
    be played.
