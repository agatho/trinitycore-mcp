  class: Creature
  method: ClearUpdateMask
  signature: void Creature::ClearUpdateMask(bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Clears the update mask for a creature, removing it from the player's visible
    update list.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method removes a creature from the player's update
    list by clearing its update mask. This is typically used during creature despawn
    operations or when the creature needs to be hidden from players. The method ensures
    that the creature is no longer visible in the player's update fields, which is
    essential for proper game mechanics and performance optimization. When remove
    is set to true, the creature is completely removed from the update mask, making
    it invisible to the player.
  parameters:
  - name: remove
    description: When true, removes the creature from the update mask entirely; when
      false, clears the update mask but keeps the creature visible in the update list.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->ClearUpdateMask(true);

      // Creature is now removed from player''s update list'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method should be called during creature despawn operations to ensure
    proper removal from the player's update list. It's important to note that this
    method does not actually delete the creature object, but rather removes it from
    the update mask.
  warnings: This method should only be used when the creature is being removed from
    the world or when the player is no longer able to see the creature. Improper use
    can cause visibility issues for players.
