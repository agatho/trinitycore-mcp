api:
  class: World
  method: SetPlayerSecurityLimit
  signature: void World::SetPlayerSecurityLimit(AccountTypes sec)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum security level allowed for players in the world.
  description: The SetPlayerSecurityLimit method configures the highest account security
    level that can be assigned to players within the game world. This limit affects
    which administrative commands and privileges players can access based on their
    account permissions. The method typically modifies internal game state to enforce
    this restriction across all connected sessions. This is commonly used during server
    maintenance or when implementing security policies to prevent unauthorized access
    to higher-level administrative functions.
  parameters:
  - name: sec
    description: The AccountTypes enumeration value representing the maximum allowed
      security level for players. Valid values include SEC_PLAYER, SEC_MODERATOR,
      SEC_GAMEMASTER, SEC_ADMINISTRATOR, and SEC_CONSOLE.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Security Limit to Game Master Level
    code: World::instance()->SetPlayerSecurityLimit(SEC_GAMEMASTER);
    language: cpp
  - title: Restricting Access to Administrator Level
    code: World::instance()->SetPlayerSecurityLimit(SEC_ADMINISTRATOR);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal server configuration variables and may
    require a restart of affected sessions to take full effect. It's typically called
    during server initialization or configuration changes rather than dynamically
    during runtime.
  warnings: Setting this limit too low may prevent legitimate administrators from
    accessing required commands. Setting it too high could expose the server to unauthorized
    access if not properly secured at the authentication layer.
