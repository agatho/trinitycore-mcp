documentation:
  brief: Processes a client packet to set or update a guild member's private note.
  description: The HandleGuildSetMemberNote method handles incoming packets from players
    attempting to set or modify a guild member's private note. This functionality
    allows guild leaders and officers to maintain personal notes about specific members
    for administrative purposes. The method validates the player's permissions within
    the guild, ensures the target member exists, and updates the database record accordingly.
    It is part of the guild management system in TrinityCore, enabling rich guild
    interaction features.

  examples:
  - title: Setting a Guild Member Note
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleGuildSetMemberNote(WorldPackets::Guild::GuildSetMemberNote&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    // Validate guild membership and permissions\n    if (!CanModifyGuild())\n\
      \        return;\n    \n    // Update the note in database\n    CharacterDatabase.Execute(\"\
      UPDATE guild_member SET Note = ? WHERE guid = ?\", packet.Note, packet.Guid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player opens the guild member panel
    and edits a private note. The packet contains both the target member's GUID and
    the new note text. It requires proper authentication and guild permission checks
    before any database modification occurs.
  warnings: Improper validation of guild membership or permissions could lead to unauthorized
    modifications of guild data. Ensure that only authorized players (guild leaders
    or officers) can invoke this method.
