  class: Unit
  method: SetFullPower
  signature: void Unit::SetFullPower(int power)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the unit's power to its maximum value.
  description: This method sets the unit's current power level to its full, maximum
    value. It is commonly used to restore a unit's power completely, such as when
    a player or creature is initialized or when a specific power type needs to be
    reset. The method affects all power types including mana, rage, focus, energy,
    and others depending on the unit's type. This action is typically performed during
    initialization or when resetting power after certain game mechanics events.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The power value to set the unit's power to. This represents the maximum
      value for the unit's current power type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* target = new Unit;\n target->SetFullPower(100);\n // Sets the unit's\
      \ power to 100 (assuming 100 is the maximum value for that power type)"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be used when the unit's power type is known and valid.
    It may cause issues if used on units with different power types than intended.
    The method does not validate the power type or its maximum value, so developers
    must ensure correct usage.
  warnings: Using this method without proper validation can lead to incorrect power
    values or game mechanics disruption. Ensure that the unit's power type matches
    the intended power value before calling this method.
