  class: UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource
  method: Consume
  signature: bool UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource::Consume(uint32 runesCost)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of runes and returns true if successful, false
    otherwise.
  description: "The Consume method attempts to deduct a given number of runes from\
    \ the player's rune resource pool. This method is typically used in the context\
    \ of Death Knight abilities that require\u6D88\u8017 runes to function. The method\
    \ checks whether sufficient runes are available before performing the deduction.\
    \ If the requested number of runes can be consumed, the method updates the internal\
    \ rune count and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false without modifying the\
    \ rune count. This method is integral to the gameplay mechanics of Death Knights\
    \ in World of Warcraft, particularly when using abilities like Death Strike or\
    \ other rune-based spells."
  parameters:
  - name: runesCost
    description: The number of runes to consume from the resource pool. Must be a
      positive integer representing the count of runes required for the ability or
      action being performed.
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of runes were successfully consumed,
    false if there were insufficient runes available to fulfill the request.
  examples:
  - title: Basic rune consumption
    code: "if (player->GetRuneResource()->Consume(1)) {\n    // Successfully consumed\
      \ 1 rune\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_DEATH_STRIKE);\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Not enough runes available\n    SendSystemMessage(\"Not enough runes.\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming multiple runes for a powerful ability
    code: "uint32 requiredRunes = 2;\nif (player->GetRuneResource()->Consume(requiredRunes))\
      \ {\n    // Successfully consumed 2 runes\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_BLOOD_BOIL);\n\
      } else {\n    // Insufficient runes for Blood Boil\n    SendSystemMessage(\"\
      Not enough runes to cast Blood Boil.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the UnholyRuneRunicPowerResource class, which manages
    rune-based resources for Death Knights. The internal state of runes is typically
    updated in real-time as abilities are cast or runes regenerate. This method does
    not directly handle rune regeneration; it only consumes existing runes.
  warnings: Ensure that the runesCost parameter is a valid positive integer. Calling
    this method with zero or negative values may lead to undefined behavior. Always
    verify the return value before proceeding with actions that depend on successful
    rune consumption.
