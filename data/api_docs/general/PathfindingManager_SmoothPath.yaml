  class: PathfindingManager
  method: SmoothPath
  signature: int PathfindingManager::SmoothPath(const int & waypoints)
documentation:
  brief: Smooths a path by reducing unnecessary waypoints and optimizing movement
    for NPCs or creatures.
  description: The SmoothPath method in the PathfindingManager class optimizes an
    existing path by removing redundant waypoints and adjusting the route to ensure
    smoother, more efficient movement. This is particularly useful for NPC behavior,
    where direct paths may not be ideal for realistic movement patterns. The method
    typically operates on a precomputed waypoint list stored internally within the
    manager. It modifies the path in place and returns a status code indicating success
    or failure of the smoothing operation.
  parameters:
  - name: waypoints
    description: Reference to an integer representing the number of waypoints in the
      current path. This parameter is used to determine how many waypoints should
      be processed during the smoothing operation.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the smoothing
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates success, while negative values
    may indicate errors such as invalid input or insufficient waypoints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Smoothing Usage
    code: "PathfindingManager* pathfinder = ...;\nint waypointCount = 10;\nint result\
      \ = pathfinder->SmoothPath(waypointCount);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Path\
      \ smoothing completed successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the internal waypoint list has already been populated
    with valid path data. The actual smoothing algorithm may vary depending on implementation,
    but generally involves reducing zigzagging and optimizing for straight-line movement
    where possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the waypoints parameter refers to a valid number of waypoints
    previously set in the manager's internal path storage. Passing an invalid or zero
    waypoint count may lead to undefined behavior or errors.
