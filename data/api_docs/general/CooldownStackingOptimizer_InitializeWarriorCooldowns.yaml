  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking system for warrior class abilities.
  description: The InitializeWarriorCooldowns method sets up and configures the internal
    cooldown tracking mechanism specifically for warrior class abilities within the
    CooldownStackingOptimizer. This method prepares the system to monitor and manage
    cooldowns for warrior-specific spells and abilities, ensuring proper stacking
    behavior and optimal usage timing. It typically initializes data structures, registers
    ability handlers, and sets up any necessary state tracking for warrior cooldowns.
    The method should be called during the initialization phase of a warrior's cooldown
    management system.

    cooldown management system. It assumes that the underlying cooldown tracking infrastructure
    is already set up and ready for use.
