  brief: Satisfies quest dependent quests for a player
  description: This method processes and satisfies all quest dependencies for a given
    quest, ensuring that any prerequisite quests are completed before allowing the
    current quest to be accepted. The method checks if the player has met all requirements
    for the dependent quests and updates the quest status accordingly. It returns
    true if all dependencies are satisfied, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: qInfo
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs to be processed for dependent
      quests
  - name: msg
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to send messages to player about
      quest completion status
  returns: Returns true if all dependent quests are satisfied, false otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      Quest* quest = sQuestMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      bool result = player->SatisfyQuestDependentQuests(quest, true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by the quest system to ensure proper
    quest progression. It may trigger quest completion notifications if msg is set
    to true.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context as it
    may cause quest status inconsistencies if used improperly
