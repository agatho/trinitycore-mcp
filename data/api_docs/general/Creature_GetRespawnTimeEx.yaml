  method: GetRespawnTimeEx
  signature: time_t Creature::GetRespawnTimeEx() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time of the creature in seconds since epoch.
  description: This method retrieves the exact time when the creature will respawn,
    expressed as a Unix timestamp. It is commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to determine when a creature will reappear after being killed or despawned.
    The returned value represents the moment when the creature's respawn timer ends
    and the creature becomes available for spawning again. This method is essential
    for managing creature spawn timers and implementing game mechanics related to
    creature lifecycle.
  parameters: []
  returns: The return value represents a Unix timestamp indicating when the creature
    will respawn. If the creature is currently spawned, this value will be in the
    past, indicating that it has already respawned or is about to respawn. The value
    can be used for calculating time remaining until respawn or for determining if
    the creature is available for spawning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "time_t respawnTime = creature->GetRespawnTimeEx();\nif (respawnTime > time(nullptr))\
      \ {\n    // Creature has not yet respawned\n    std::cout << \"Creature will\
      \ respawn in: \" << difftime(respawnTime, time(nullptr)) << \" seconds\";\n\
      } else {\n    // Creature has already respawned\n    std::cout << \"Creature\
      \ is currently available for spawning\";\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other creature spawn-related
    methods. The returned time_t value represents a Unix timestamp, which is commonly
    used in C++ applications for time calculations and comparisons. This method may
    return different values depending on whether the creature is currently spawned
    or not, making it important to understand the context of when this method is called.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can return negative values
    or values in the past if the creature has already respawned. It's important to
    distinguish between the time when a creature was last spawned versus when it will
    respawn again, particularly for handling spawn timers correctly.
