  signature: bool MapEntry::IsDynamicDifficultyMap() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map supports dynamic difficulty adjustments.
  description: The IsDynamicDifficultyMap method checks if a specific map entry allows
    for dynamic difficulty changes during gameplay. This functionality is typically
    used for instances where the difficulty level can be modified based on player
    count, group composition, or other game conditions. The method returns true if
    the map supports such dynamic adjustments, and false otherwise. This is particularly
    relevant in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation where certain raid
    and dungeon maps may have different behaviors regarding difficulty scaling.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map supports dynamic difficulty adjustments; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check map difficulty support
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(mapId);\nif (entry && entry->IsDynamicDifficultyMap())\
      \ {\n    // Handle dynamic difficulty logic\n    printf(\"Map supports dynamic\
      \ difficulty\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Handle static difficulty\n    printf(\"\
      Map does not support dynamic difficulty\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with map loading and instance
    management systems. The implementation likely relies on internal flags or configuration
    data associated with each map entry in the game's database.
  warnings: Developers should be aware that maps marked as supporting dynamic difficulty
    may require additional handling for player progression, loot distribution, and
    encounter scaling logic.
