  method: InvitePlayerToQueue
  signature: void Battlefield::InvitePlayerToQueue(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Invites a player to join the Battlefield queue for participation in an upcoming
    battle.
  description: The InvitePlayerToQueue method is responsible for adding a player to
    the Battlefield's queue system, allowing them to participate in the next available
    battlefield match. This method typically gets invoked when a player interacts
    with a Battlefield ticket vendor or accepts a battlefield invitation. The player
    must be within the correct zone and meet eligibility requirements such as level
    restrictions and quest prerequisites. Once invited, the player will be queued
    for battle and may receive notifications about their placement in the queue or
    when the battle is about to begin.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that should be invited to join the
      Battlefield queue. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in a Battlefield Gossip Handler
    code: "void OnGossipHello(Player* player, Creature* creature)\n{\n    if (player->GetMap()->IsBattleArena())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Invite the player to the battlefield queue\n    if\
      \ (Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByPlayer(player))\n    \
      \    bf->InvitePlayerToQueue(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inviting Player with Precondition Check
    code: "void InvitePlayerToBattlefield(Player* player)\n{\n    if (!player || !player->IsInWorld())\n\
      \        return;\n\n    // Ensure player is eligible for battlefield\n    if\
      \ (player->GetLevel() < 10 || player->GetLevel() > 80)\n        return;\n\n\
      \    // Get active battlefield and invite player\n    Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByPlayer(player);\n\
      \    if (bf)\n        bf->InvitePlayerToQueue(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not directly start the battle; it only adds the player to
    a waiting queue. The actual battlefield match initiation is handled by separate
    systems that monitor queue status and trigger battles based on predefined criteria
    such as minimum player count or time delays.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring the player is in a valid battlefield
    zone may result in unexpected behavior or errors. Always validate that the Battlefield
    instance exists and that the player meets all requirements before invoking this
    method.
