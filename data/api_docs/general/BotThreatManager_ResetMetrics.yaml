documentation:
  brief: Resets all threat metrics and clears the current threat state for the bot.
  description: The ResetMetrics method initializes or reinitializes the threat tracking
    system within the BotThreatManager. This function typically clears existing threat
    values, resets internal counters, and prepares the manager to begin tracking threat
    from a clean state. It is commonly invoked when a bot's combat session begins
    or after significant changes in the bot's behavior or target selection. The method
    ensures that threat data is not carried over between different combat scenarios,
    maintaining accurate and isolated threat calculations for each individual encounter.
