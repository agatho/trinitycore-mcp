  brief: Moves ownership of all data from the source ObjectMgr to this ObjectMgr instance
  description: The move assignment operator for ObjectMgr transfers all internal resources
    and data from another ObjectMgr instance to the current one. This operation is
    typically used when reassigning an ObjectMgr object to a temporary or newly created
    instance, allowing efficient resource transfer without deep copying. The source
    ObjectMgr will be left in a valid but unspecified state after the move. This method
    is part of the standard C++ move semantics and is commonly used in container operations
    and function returns where temporary objects are moved rather than copied.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current ObjectMgr instance, allowing for chaining of
    assignments
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'ObjectMgr manager1;

      ObjectMgr manager2 = std::move(manager1); // Move manager1''s data to manager2

      // manager1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Return with Move Assignment
    code: "ObjectMgr createManager() {\n    ObjectMgr mgr;\n    // ... populate manager\
      \ ...\n    return mgr; // Move semantics used for return\n}\n\nObjectMgr mainManager\
      \ = createManager(); // Move assignment in action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ standard move semantics. It's important to
    note that after a move operation, the source object should not be used unless
    explicitly reset or reassigned. The ObjectMgr class likely manages internal data
    structures like maps and containers containing game objects, which are efficiently
    transferred during the move operation rather than copied.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source ObjectMgr instance should not
    be used for any operations that require valid data, as it will have been left
    in a moved-from state. This is a standard behavior of C++ move semantics and applies
    to all classes implementing move assignment operators.
