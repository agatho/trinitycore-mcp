  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: CanPerformRole
  signature: bool LFGRoleDetector::CanPerformRole(Player * player, uint8 role)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can perform a specified role in the Looking for
    Group system.
  description: The CanPerformRole method evaluates if a given player is eligible to
    take on a specific role within the Looking for Group (LFG) framework. This evaluation
    typically considers factors such as the player's class, specialization, level,
    and any role restrictions or requirements defined by the game mechanics. The method
    returns true if the player meets all necessary criteria to fulfill the requested
    role, and false otherwise. It is commonly used during LFG queue processing and
    group matching to ensure that players are assigned to roles appropriate for their
    capabilities.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose eligibility for the specified
      role is being evaluated. Must not be null.
  - name: role
    description: The role identifier (uint8) that the player is being checked against.
      Valid values typically correspond to LFG roles such as TANK, HEALER, or DAMAGE.
  returns: Returns true if the player can perform the specified role based on their
    class, specialization, and other relevant game state; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a player can fulfill the tank role
    code: "Player* myPlayer = ...;\nuint8 requiredRole = LFG_ROLE_TANK;\nbool canTank\
      \ = LFGRoleDetector::CanPerformRole(myPlayer, requiredRole);\nif (canTank)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with assigning player to tank role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate multiple roles for a player in LFG context
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nuint8 roles[] = { LFG_ROLE_TANK, LFG_ROLE_HEALER,\
      \ LFG_ROLE_DAMAGE };\nfor (uint8 role : roles)\n{\n    if (LFGRoleDetector::CanPerformRole(player,\
      \ role))\n    {\n        // Player can fulfill this role\n        // Add to\
      \ appropriate LFG queue or group\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely integrates with TrinityCore's LFG system and may consider
    player data such as class, spec, level, and equipped gear. It is assumed that
    the role parameter aligns with predefined LFG role constants (e.g., LFG_ROLE_TANK,
    LFG_ROLE_HEALER). The implementation might cache or precompute certain checks
    for performance in high-frequency scenarios like queue updates.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior. Also,
    be aware that role constants must match those defined in the LFG system; mismatched
    values could lead to incorrect evaluations.
