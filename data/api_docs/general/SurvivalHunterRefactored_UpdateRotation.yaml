documentation:
  brief: Updates the survival hunter's rotation logic based on current target and
    combat state
  description: The UpdateRotation method is responsible for determining and executing
    the optimal sequence of abilities and actions for a survival hunter class in World
    of Warcraft. This method evaluates the current combat situation, target health,
    available resources, and cooldowns to decide which spells or abilities should
    be cast next. It typically integrates with the AI system to make real-time tactical
    decisions during player versus environment encounters. The method does not directly
    perform actions but rather updates internal state and prepares commands for execution
    by the core AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity that the hunter is currently engaging
      or considering engaging. This parameter allows the rotation logic to evaluate
      target properties such as health, distance, and threat level to determine appropriate
      actions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "void MyHunterAI::Update()\n{\n    Unit* currentTarget = GetVictim();\n\
      \    if (currentTarget)\n        m_hunter->UpdateRotation(&currentTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with custom rotation logic
    code: "void SurvivalHunterRefactored::UpdateRotation(int* target)\n{\n    if (!target\
      \ || *target == 0) return;\n    \n    // Evaluate target conditions\n    if\
      \ (GetTargetHealthPercent(*target) < 20)\n        CastAbility(SpellId::ChimeraShot);\n\
      \    else\n        CastAbility(SpellId::AimedShot);\n    \n    // Handle cooldowns\
      \ and resource management\n    ManageCooldowns();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should not
    be invoked directly from combat actions. The target parameter must point to a
    valid entity ID; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Implementation may involve
    complex state machines or decision trees that evaluate multiple factors including
    distance, threat level, and spell availability.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to crashes or incorrect
    AI behavior. This method assumes the target is in a valid combat state and may
    not handle situations where the target is dead or out of range properly. Avoid
    calling this method outside of the AI update loop as it might interfere with internal
    state management.
