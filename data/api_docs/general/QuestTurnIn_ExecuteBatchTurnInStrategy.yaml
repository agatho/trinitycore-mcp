  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: ExecuteBatchTurnInStrategy
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::ExecuteBatchTurnInStrategy(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a batch quest turn-in strategy for the specified player bot.
  description: The ExecuteBatchTurnInStrategy method processes multiple quest turn-ins
    in a single operation for a given player bot. This method is typically used by
    AI systems or automated quest completion scripts to efficiently handle multiple
    quest submissions without requiring individual processing. It evaluates available
    quests that can be turned in, determines the optimal order of submission, and
    executes the turn-in process for all eligible quests. The method ensures proper
    handling of quest rewards, updates quest status, and manages inventory changes
    as part of the turn-in process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the batch quest turn-ins. Must be a valid player instance with active quests
      available for completion.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get reference to bot player

      QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;

      questTurnIn.ExecuteBatchTurnInStrategy(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nif (bot != nullptr) {\n    QuestTurnIn questTurnIn;\n\
      \    try {\n        questTurnIn.ExecuteBatchTurnInStrategy(bot);\n        //\
      \ Handle successful batch turn-in\n    } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n\
      \        // Log error or handle exception\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed for use in automated quest completion systems and
    should not be called directly from player interaction contexts. The method may
    perform multiple database operations and inventory updates, so it's recommended
    to call it during idle periods or when the bot is not actively engaged in other
    activities. Consider performance implications when processing large numbers of
    quests.
  warnings: Calling this method on a player with no available quests for turn-in will
    result in no action being taken. Ensure that the player has valid quests ready
    for completion before calling this method. The method assumes proper quest state
    management and may not handle edge cases where quest data is corrupted or inconsistent.
