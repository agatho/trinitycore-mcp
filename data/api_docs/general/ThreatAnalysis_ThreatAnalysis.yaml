  class: ThreatAnalysis
  method: ThreatAnalysis
  signature: void ThreatAnalysis::ThreatAnalysis()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes threat analysis for a creature or player in the World of Warcraft
    instance
  description: The ThreatAnalysis constructor initializes the threat management system
    for a unit, setting up internal tracking structures to monitor and calculate threat
    levels from various sources. This method is typically invoked during unit creation
    or when threat analysis capabilities are enabled for a specific entity. It establishes
    the foundation for threat calculations, including initializing threat tables,
    setting up threat modifiers, and preparing the unit's threat state for incoming
    combat events. The method ensures that subsequent threat-related operations such
    as threat updates, threat sorting, and threat distribution functions operate correctly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Threat Analysis Initialization
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      ThreatAnalysis threatAnalyzer;

      threatAnalyzer.ThreatAnalysis(); // Initialize threat analysis for the creature'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per unit during initialization. Repeated
    calls may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. The constructor does not
    directly interact with the game world but prepares internal data structures that
    will be used by other threat-related methods.
  warnings: Do not call this method on units that are already in combat, as it may
    interfere with existing threat calculations. Ensure proper cleanup of threat analysis
    objects to prevent memory leaks.
