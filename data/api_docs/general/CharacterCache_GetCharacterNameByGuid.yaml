  signature: bool CharacterCache::GetCharacterNameByGuid(int guid, std::string & name)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the name of a character associated with the given GUID from the
    cache.
  description: The GetCharacterNameByGuid method attempts to find and return the name
    of a character using its unique identifier (GUID) from the internal character
    cache. This method is typically used in TrinityCore's server environment to efficiently
    retrieve character names without performing expensive database queries. The method
    returns true if the character GUID exists in the cache and the name was successfully
    retrieved, otherwise it returns false. It's important to note that this function
    only works with characters already present in the cache, which may be populated
    through various game events or initial loading processes.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the character to look up. This is
      typically a positive integer representing the character's database ID.
  - name: name
    description: Reference to a std::string where the character name will be stored
      upon successful lookup. The string will be empty if the lookup fails.
  returns: Returns true if the character with the specified GUID was found in the
    cache and the name was successfully retrieved; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int playerGuid = 12345;\nstd::string playerName;\nif (CharacterCache::GetCharacterNameByGuid(playerGuid,\
      \ playerName)) {\n    std::cout << \"Character name: \" << playerName << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    std::cout << \"Character not found in cache.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a Game Command
    code: "void HandleGetNameCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args) {\n \
      \   if (!args || !strlen(args))\n        return false;\n    \n    uint32 guid\
      \ = atoi(args);\n    std::string name;\n    if (sCharacterCache->GetCharacterNameByGuid(guid,\
      \ name)) {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Character name for GUID %u is:\
      \ %s\", guid, name.c_str());\n    } else {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"\
      No character found with GUID %u\", guid);\n    }\n    return true;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on cached data only and does not perform database lookups.
    The cache must be populated beforehand for this method to succeed. Performance
    is optimized as it uses fast lookup mechanisms such as hash tables or maps internally.
    This function should be used primarily in scenarios where character names are
    needed frequently but database access is undesirable.
  warnings: This function will return false if the GUID does not exist in the cache,
    which may happen if the character has never been loaded into memory or was recently
    deleted from the cache. It's crucial to validate that the cache contains the character
    data before calling this method for reliable results.
