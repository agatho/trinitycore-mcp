documentation:
  brief: Withdraws repair items from the guild bank for use by a player.
  description: The WithdrawRepairItems method allows a player to withdraw repair items
    from the guild bank, typically used when a player needs to repair their equipment
    using guild resources. This method likely handles the logic of checking if the
    player has sufficient guild funds or permissions, deducting the required items
    from the guild bank inventory, and providing those items to the player's inventory.
    It is part of the guild bank management system that enables players to utilize
    shared guild resources for maintaining their gear. The method may also perform
    validation checks to ensure the player is eligible to withdraw repair items and
    that sufficient items exist in the guild bank.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's identifier or index
      within the system. This parameter likely serves as a reference to identify which
      player is attempting to withdraw repair items from the guild bank.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.WithdrawRepairItems(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the guild bank's item tracking system and
    may require the player to be in a valid state (e.g., logged in, within guild)
    to successfully execute. Implementation details may involve checking guild permissions,
    item availability, and updating both player and guild bank inventories.
  warnings: Improper handling of the player parameter could lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect item withdrawal. Ensure that the player identifier is valid and corresponds
    to an active player in the system before calling this method.
