  class: InteractionManager
  method: HandleGossipMenu
  signature: void InteractionManager::HandleGossipMenu(Player * bot, uint32 menuId,
    WorldObject * target)
documentation:
  brief: Displays a gossip menu for the player based on the provided menu ID and target
    object.
  description: The HandleGossipMenu method is responsible for initiating and displaying
    a gossip menu to a player character within the World of Warcraft environment.
    It takes a player bot, a menu identifier, and a target object (such as an NPC
    or GameObject) to determine what menu content should be presented. This method
    typically gets invoked when a player interacts with an interactive object that
    has associated gossip options. The implementation likely retrieves the appropriate
    gossip data from the database or internal structures based on the menu ID and
    target, then sends the relevant UI elements to the client for display.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot or player who will
      see the gossip menu. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: menuId
    description: Unique identifier for the gossip menu to be displayed. This ID corresponds
      to entries in the gossip_menu table within the TrinityCore database.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject that triggered the gossip interaction
      (e.g., an NPC or GameObject). Used to determine context and potentially influence
      which options are shown.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Menu Display
    code: 'InteractionManager* im = sWorld->GetInteractionManager();

      Player* player = ...; // valid player instance

      WorldObject* npc = ...; // valid NPC object

      im->HandleGossipMenu(player, 12345, npc);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the menuId exists in the database and that appropriate
    gossip options are defined for it. The target object's type and state may affect
    which gossip entries are displayed or how they behave. It is typically called
    as part of an interaction flow initiated by a player's click on an NPC or GameObject.
  warnings: Ensure that the menuId passed is valid and corresponds to existing gossip
    data; otherwise, no menu will be displayed. Passing null pointers for bot or target
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
