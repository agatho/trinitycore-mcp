  signature: std::vector<std::string> ModuleManager::GetRegisteredModules()
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of all currently registered module names managed by the
    ModuleManager.
  description: The GetRegisteredModules method returns a vector containing the names
    of all modules that have been successfully registered with the ModuleManager.
    This method provides read-only access to the internal registry of loaded modules,
    allowing developers to inspect which modules are active within the system. The
    returned vector contains string identifiers representing each registered module,
    and the order of elements may vary depending on the registration sequence or internal
    implementation details. This functionality is commonly used for debugging, module
    management, or validating that expected modules are properly loaded during runtime.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<std::string> containing the names of all registered modules.
    Each string represents a unique identifier for a module that has been successfully
    added to the manager's registry. The vector may be empty if no modules have been
    registered yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "std::vector<std::string> modules = sModuleManager->GetRegisteredModules();\n\
      for (const auto& moduleName : modules)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Registered module:\
      \ \" << moduleName << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a read-only operation on the internal module registry
    and does not modify any state. It is safe to call from multiple threads, assuming
    the underlying ModuleManager implementation is thread-safe. The returned vector
    is a copy of the internal data structure, so modifications to the returned vector
    will not affect the actual module registry.
