  method: GetCasterLevel
  signature: uint8 Aura::GetCasterLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the level of the caster who applied the aura.
  description: The GetCasterLevel method returns the level of the creature or player
    who originally applied the aura to the target. This value is typically used in
    spell calculations, such as determining damage scaling or effect strength based
    on the caster's level. The returned level is stored when the aura is initially
    created and remains constant throughout the aura's duration, regardless of any
    changes to the caster's level during that time. This method is commonly used in
    combat systems where aura effects are dependent on the caster's power level.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the level of the aura's caster. This value is
    typically between 1 and 255, though it may be higher for certain high-level creatures
    or players in advanced content.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Determine Caster Power
    code: "void HandleAuraEffect(Aura* aura)\n{\n    uint8 casterLevel = aura->GetCasterLevel();\n\
      \    if (casterLevel >= 80)\n    {\n        // Apply enhanced effects for high-level\
      \ casters\n        ApplyEnhancedEffect();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //\
      \ Apply standard effects\n        ApplyStandardEffect();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Caster Level in Damage Calculation
    code: "void CalculateDamage(Unit* target, Aura* aura)\n{\n    uint8 casterLevel\
      \ = aura->GetCasterLevel();\n    float damageMultiplier = 1.0f + (casterLevel\
      \ / 100.0f);\n    // Apply the calculated multiplier to base damage\n    float\
      \ finalDamage = baseDamage * damageMultiplier;\n    target->DealDamage(finalDamage);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The caster level returned by this method is cached at the time of aura application
    and will not reflect any changes in the caster's level that occur after the aura
    has been applied. This ensures consistency in spell effects during an aura's duration.
  warnings: This method should only be called on valid aura instances. Calling it
    on a null aura pointer will result in undefined behavior. Additionally, be aware
    that for some special cases like temporary enchantments or certain world events,
    the caster level might not represent the actual player or creature level.
