documentation:
  brief: Collects all pets belonging to the player and returns them to their owner's
    side.
  description: The CollectPets method is responsible for gathering all summoned pets
    controlled by the player within the game world. It ensures that any active pets,
    including those summoned through various spells or abilities, are returned to
    the player's side. This functionality is commonly used in AI behavior scripts
    to manage pet positioning and control during combat or movement sequences. The
    method typically handles the logic for recalling pets, updating their states,
    and ensuring proper interaction with the player's current location.

  - title: Basic Pet Collection Usage
    code: "void MyAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    m_behaviorManager->CollectPets();\n\
      \    // All pets are now gathered to the player's side\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has active pets in the world. It may
    not perform any action if no pets exist. The implementation likely involves iterating
    through the player's pet list and issuing recall commands or movement updates.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is called only when appropriate, as frequent calls
    might interfere with other AI behaviors. Also, calling it during combat could
    potentially disrupt ongoing pet actions or spell casts.
