  class: DuelInfo
  method: DuelInfo
  signature: void DuelInfo::DuelInfo(Player * opponent, Player * initiator, bool isMounted)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a duel between two players, setting up duel state and handling
    mount status.
  description: The DuelInfo constructor initializes a new duel between two players
    by storing references to the opponent and initiator, along with information about
    whether either player is mounted. This method sets up the internal state required
    for managing a duel in the TrinityCore framework. The duel state is typically
    initialized when one player challenges another, and this constructor handles the
    setup of the duel's basic parameters including mount status which affects combat
    mechanics. It prepares the duel environment by storing necessary player references
    and duel-specific flags.
  parameters:
  - name: opponent
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the opponent in the duel.
      Must be a valid player instance, cannot be null.
  - name: initiator
    description: Pointer to the Player object who initiated the duel. Must be a valid
      player instance, cannot be null.
  - name: isMounted
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the initiating player is currently
      mounted. True if mounted, false otherwise.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic duel initialization
    code: 'Player* player1 = ...; // First player

      Player* player2 = ...; // Second player

      DuelInfo duel(player2, player1, false);

      // Initializes a duel between player1 and player2 with player1 not mounted'
    language: cpp
  - title: Duel initialization with mounted player
    code: 'Player* mountedPlayer = ...; // Player on mount

      Player* normalPlayer = ...; // Player not on mount

      DuelInfo duel(normalPlayer, mountedPlayer, true);

      // Initializes a duel where the initiator is mounted'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore duel system
    when a player initiates a duel. The constructor stores references to both players
    and sets up the duel state, but does not actually start the duel combat. The mount
    status parameter affects how the duel is handled in terms of movement restrictions
    and combat mechanics. This constructor should only be called with valid Player
    pointers.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the full duel
    system implementation. Passing null pointers for opponent or initiator will likely
    cause crashes or undefined behavior. The mount status parameter must accurately
    reflect the actual player state to ensure proper duel mechanics.
