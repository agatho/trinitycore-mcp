  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: RecordCombatPerformance
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::RecordCombatPerformance(uint32_t botGuid,
    float damage, float healing, float damageTaken)
documentation:
  brief: Records combat performance metrics for a bot including damage dealt, healing
    done, and damage taken.
  description: 'The RecordCombatPerformance method logs key combat statistics for
    a specified bot within the TrinityCore framework. It tracks three primary metrics:
    damage dealt by the bot, healing performed by the bot, and damage received by
    the bot during combat. This data is typically used for performance analysis, bot
    optimization, or generating combat reports. The method operates on a per-bot basis
    using the bot''s unique identifier (GUID) to associate the performance data with
    the correct entity. No explicit preconditions are required, but the bot must be
    active and engaged in combat for meaningful data to be recorded.'
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose combat performance
      is being recorded. This value identifies the specific game object in the world.
  - name: damage
    description: The total amount of damage dealt by the bot during the combat session.
      Should be a non-negative floating-point number representing damage points.
  - name: healing
    description: The total amount of healing performed by the bot during the combat
      session. Must be a non-negative floating-point number representing healing points.
  - name: damageTaken
    description: The total amount of damage received by the bot during the combat
      session. Should be a non-negative floating-point number representing damage
      taken.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      optimizer.RecordCombatPerformance(botGuid, 500.0f, 300.0f, 200.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Dynamic Values
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      float totalDamage = CalculateTotalDamageDealt(player);

      float totalHealing = CalculateTotalHealingDone(player);

      float damageTaken = CalculateTotalDamageReceived(player);

      optimizer.RecordCombatPerformance(botGuid, totalDamage, totalHealing, damageTaken);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system in TrinityCore.
    It may store data in internal buffers or databases for later analysis. The method
    does not perform any validation on input values beyond basic type checking; it's
    up to the caller to ensure valid non-negative float values are passed.
  warnings: Passing negative values for damage, healing, or damageTaken may lead to
    incorrect performance metrics. Ensure that botGuid corresponds to an actual active
    bot in the game world to avoid data corruption or invalid references.
