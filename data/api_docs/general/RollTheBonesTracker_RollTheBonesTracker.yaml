documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new RollTheBonesTracker instance with default values.
  description: The RollTheBonesTracker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    RollTheBonesTracker class. This class is used to track and manage the state of
    roll-the-bones mechanics within the game, particularly for handling loot distribution
    or gameplay events related to the 'Roll the Bones' feature. The constructor sets
    up internal data structures and default configurations required for tracking rolls,
    outcomes, and associated player interactions. It ensures that all necessary member
    variables are properly initialized before the tracker can be used for gameplay
    operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new RollTheBonesTracker instance
    code: 'RollTheBonesTracker tracker;

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track rolls'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not take any parameters, so it performs a default initialization.
    Developers should ensure that any necessary configuration or setup of the tracker's
    state occurs after construction, typically through dedicated setter methods or
    initialization functions.
