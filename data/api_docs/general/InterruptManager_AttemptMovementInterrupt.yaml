  class: InterruptManager
  method: AttemptMovementInterrupt
  signature: bool InterruptManager::AttemptMovementInterrupt(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to interrupt the target unit's current movement action.
  description: The AttemptMovementInterrupt method checks if a given unit's current
    movement can be interrupted. It evaluates various conditions such as the unit's
    state, movement type, and whether interruption is allowed by game mechanics. This
    method is typically used during combat or spell casting to determine if an ongoing
    movement should be halted. The function returns true if the movement was successfully
    interrupted, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper
    game flow during player and NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement is to be interrupted. Must
      not be null.
  returns: True if the target's movement was successfully interrupted, false if interruption
    failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat
    code: "if (interruptManager.AttemptMovementInterrupt(playerUnit)) {\n    // Movement\
      \ interrupted successfully\n    playerUnit->StopMoving();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with spell casting interruption
    code: "if (spell->IsChanneled() && interruptManager.AttemptMovementInterrupt(caster))\
      \ {\n    caster->InterruptSpell(currentSpellId);\n    // Handle movement interruption\
      \ logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the target unit. It should
    only be called when there is a valid reason to interrupt movement, such as casting
    a spell or taking damage. The method does not perform any direct movement stopping;
    it only determines if interruption is possible.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the target unit is actually
    moving may result in unnecessary processing. Always ensure the target unit has
    an active movement state before calling this function to avoid performance degradation.
