  class: RoleAssignment
  method: CalculateGearScore
  signature: float RoleAssignment::CalculateGearScore(Player * player, GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the gear score for a player based on their equipped
    items and assigned role.
  description: The CalculateGearScore method computes a numerical representation of
    a player's item level and overall equipment quality, tailored to their assigned
    group role. This value is used by the game's role assignment system to determine
    appropriate gear recommendations, loot distribution strategies, and performance
    metrics within group content such as dungeons, raids, and world events. The calculation
    considers the player's equipped items, their item levels, and how well those items
    align with the specified role (e.g., tank, healer, damage dealer). This method
    is typically invoked during group composition analysis or when evaluating a player's
    suitability for specific roles in dynamic content.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose gear score will be calculated.
      Must not be null.
  - name: role
    description: The GroupRole enum value indicating the role for which the gear score
      is being calculated (e.g., ROLE_TANK, ROLE_HEALER, ROLE_DAMAGE).
  returns: A float representing the computed gear score. Higher values indicate better
    gear alignment with the specified role. Returns 0.0 if player or role is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gear Score Calculation
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player object

      GroupRole role = ROLE_DAMAGE;

      float score = RoleAssignment::CalculateGearScore(player, role);

      // score now holds the gear score for the player in the damage role'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Gear Score for Role Matching
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfloat tankScore = RoleAssignment::CalculateGearScore(player,\
      \ ROLE_TANK);\nfloat healerScore = RoleAssignment::CalculateGearScore(player,\
      \ ROLE_HEALER);\nfloat damageScore = RoleAssignment::CalculateGearScore(player,\
      \ ROLE_DAMAGE);\n\nif (damageScore > tankScore && damageScore > healerScore)\n\
      {\n    // Recommend player for damage role\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally accesses the player's inventory and evaluates each
    equipped item to determine its contribution to the overall gear score. It may
    involve calculations based on item quality, enchantments, gemming, and other factors
    that contribute to effective performance in a given role. The implementation assumes
    valid inputs and does not perform explicit null checks beyond what is implied
    by the parameters.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid Player pointer or an unrecognized
    GroupRole enum value may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Always
    validate player state before calling this function, especially in high-frequency
    scenarios like real-time group composition updates.
