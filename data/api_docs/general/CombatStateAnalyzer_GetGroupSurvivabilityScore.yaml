documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns a normalized survivability score for the group based
    on combat state metrics
  description: The GetGroupSurvivabilityScore method computes a floating-point value
    representing the overall likelihood of group survival during combat. This score
    is derived from various combat-related statistics such as player health percentages,
    damage mitigation factors, and threat distribution across the group. The method
    aggregates these metrics into a single normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0, where
    1.0 indicates optimal survivability and 0.0 represents minimal chances of survival.
    The calculation considers individual player contributions to group defense, including
    tanking effectiveness, healing output, and damage absorption capabilities. This
    method is typically used by AI systems or combat analysis tools to evaluate group
    performance and make strategic decisions during encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the normalized group survivability
    score. Values closer to 1.0 indicate higher probability of group survival, while
    values near 0.0 suggest imminent group failure in combat situations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float survivability = combatAnalyzer.GetGroupSurvivabilityScore();\nif\
      \ (survivability > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Group is considered highly survivable\n\
      \    printf(\"Group survivability: %.2f%%\\n\", survivability * 100);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Decision Making
    code: "CombatStateAnalyzer analyzer;\nfloat score = analyzer.GetGroupSurvivabilityScore();\n\
      \nif (score < 0.3f)\n{\n    // Initiate emergency escape protocol\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Critical threat detected!\");\n}\nelse if (score < 0.6f)\n{\n    // Suggest\
      \ defensive positioning\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Consider repositioning\
      \ for better survival.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations based on current combat state data and
    may return different values during dynamic encounters. The score calculation is
    influenced by the group's composition, player levels, equipment quality, and active
    buffs/debuffs. For accurate results, ensure that the CombatStateAnalyzer instance
    has been properly initialized with up-to-date combat information before calling
    this method.
  warnings: The returned value is a normalized score and should not be interpreted
    as an absolute survival probability. The method assumes valid combat state data
    exists within the analyzer instance; calling it without proper initialization
    may result in undefined behavior or inaccurate scores.
