  signature: bool DisciplinePriestRefactored::HandleGroupHealing(const int & group)
documentation:
  brief: Performs group healing for the specified group using Discipline Priest abilities
  description: The HandleGroupHealing method executes the core logic for a Discipline
    Priest to heal members of a specified group. This method typically involves selecting
    appropriate healing spells, calculating healing amounts based on priest stats
    and group composition, and applying the healing effects to target group members.
    The method is designed to work within TrinityCore's AI framework and integrates
    with the game's spell system and player management components. It handles the
    coordination of multiple healing targets and ensures proper resource usage for
    the priest's abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: The group identifier specifying which group to perform healing on.
      This parameter typically represents a group index or GUID that identifies the
      target group within the game world.
  returns: Returns true if the group healing was successfully initiated and executed,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate issues such as invalid group
    ID, insufficient mana, or failure to find suitable targets for healing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Group Healing Usage
    code: "if (priest->HandleGroupHealing(1)) {\n    // Healing process started successfully\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Group healing initiated for group 1\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // Healing failed to start\n    sLog->outString(\"Failed to initiate group\
      \ healing\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Group Healing with Error Handling
    code: "int targetGroup = player->GetGroup()->GetId();\nif (targetGroup > 0) {\n\
      \    if (priest->HandleGroupHealing(targetGroup)) {\n        // Successfully\
      \ healed group members\n        player->Say(\"Healing group members!\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Failed to heal, possibly due to insufficient resources\n\
      \        player->Say(\"Cannot perform group healing at this time.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Discipline Priest AI implementation and assumes
    that the priest has sufficient mana and valid targets within the specified group.
    The actual healing calculations and spell application are handled internally by
    TrinityCore's spell system, with this method serving as the primary interface
    for initiating group healing operations.
  warnings: The method may fail silently if the group ID is invalid or if there are
    no valid targets to heal. Ensure that the group parameter refers to an active
    group with members before calling this method. Also, be aware that frequent calls
    to this method without proper cooldown management may lead to resource exhaustion.
