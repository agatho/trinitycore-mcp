  class: MoveSplineInit
  method: SetParabolicVerticalAcceleration
  signature: void MoveSplineInit::SetParabolicVerticalAcceleration(float vertical_acceleration,
    float start_time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the vertical acceleration for parabolic movement splines used in character
    animations and pathfinding.
  description: The SetParabolicVerticalAcceleration method configures the vertical
    acceleration parameter that controls how quickly a character's movement spline
    transitions vertically during flight or jumping animations. This is particularly
    important for simulating realistic physics-based movement in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore engine, where splines define smooth paths between waypoints. The method
    accepts both a vertical acceleration value and an optional start time to control
    when the acceleration begins. It modifies internal spline parameters that affect
    the trajectory's curvature and timing, influencing how characters move through
    three-dimensional space during complex animations such as jumps, falls, or flight
    paths.
  parameters:
  - name: vertical_acceleration
    description: The rate at which vertical velocity changes over time, measured in
      units per second squared. Positive values cause upward acceleration, while negative
      values cause downward acceleration. Typical values range from -10.0 to -30.0
      for realistic falling physics.
  - name: start_time
    description: Optional parameter specifying when the vertical acceleration should
      begin relative to the spline's total duration. Value is expressed as a fraction
      between 0.0 (beginning) and 1.0 (end). If not specified or set to 0.0, acceleration
      starts immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Falling Physics
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetParabolicVerticalAcceleration(-25.0f); // Standard gravity-like
      acceleration'
    language: cpp
  - title: Custom Acceleration with Delayed Start
    code: 'MoveSplineInit splineInit;

      splineInit.SetParabolicVerticalAcceleration(15.0f, 0.3f); // Begin upward acceleration
      at 30% of total movement time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal spline state and should be called before finalizing
    the spline configuration. The vertical acceleration affects only parabolic components
    of the spline, not linear movement. Changes take effect immediately upon calling
    and may influence subsequent path calculations.
  warnings: Incorrect vertical acceleration values can cause unrealistic movement
    behavior or visual artifacts in character animations. Setting start_time beyond
    the spline duration will have no effect. This method should not be called after
    the spline has been finalized for execution.
