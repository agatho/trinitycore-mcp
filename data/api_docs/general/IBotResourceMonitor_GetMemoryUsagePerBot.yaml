  signature: uint64 IBotResourceMonitor::GetMemoryUsagePerBot() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage per bot in bytes.
  description: The GetMemoryUsagePerBot method retrieves the average amount of memory
    consumed by each artificial intelligence bot within the TrinityCore instance.
    This value represents the combined memory footprint of all active bots, including
    their data structures, scripts, and associated resources. The returned value is
    expressed in bytes and can be used for performance monitoring, resource allocation
    decisions, or debugging purposes. This method does not require any parameters
    and provides a snapshot of current memory consumption per bot.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint64 value representing the total memory usage per bot in bytes. This
    value reflects the average memory consumed by each individual bot instance currently
    active in the system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint64 memoryPerBot = sBotResourceMonitor->GetMemoryUsagePerBot();

      std::cout << "Memory usage per bot: " << memoryPerBot << " bytes" << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring Example
    code: "uint64 currentMemory = sBotResourceMonitor->GetMemoryUsagePerBot();\nif\
      \ (currentMemory > MAX_ALLOWED_MEMORY_PER_BOT)\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Warning:\
      \ Memory usage per bot exceeds threshold (%llu bytes)\", currentMemory);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a real-time measurement of memory consumption. The value
    may fluctuate as bots are created, destroyed, or their internal states change.
    It's recommended to call this method periodically for performance monitoring rather
    than continuously to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: The returned memory usage includes all bot-related allocations and may
    not reflect only the core AI logic. Memory allocated by external libraries or
    scripts used by bots might also be included in the calculation, potentially leading
    to higher values than expected.
