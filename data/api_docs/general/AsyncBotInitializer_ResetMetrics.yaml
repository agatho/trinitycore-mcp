documentation:
  brief: Resets all collected metrics and performance data for the asynchronous bot
    initializer.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears all accumulated performance statistics
    and metric data within the AsyncBotInitializer class. This function is typically
    called to reset counters, timers, and other tracking mechanisms that monitor the
    initialization process of asynchronous bots. It ensures a clean state for subsequent
    operations and prevents carryover of stale data between different initialization
    cycles. The method does not require any specific preconditions and can be safely
    invoked at any time during the system's operation.

    code: 'AsyncBotInitializer initializer;

      initializer.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context without
    causing race conditions. It's recommended to call this method before starting
    a new batch of bot initializations to ensure accurate performance measurements.
