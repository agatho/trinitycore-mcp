documentation:
  brief: Moves an AuctionBotConfig object to another, transferring ownership of its
    resources.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment on the AuctionBotConfig
    class, transferring all member data and resources from the source object to the
    target object. This operation is typically used when assigning temporary or rvalue
    objects to existing instances, allowing for efficient resource management by avoiding
    unnecessary copying. The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified
    state, suitable for immediate destruction or reassignment. In the context of TrinityCore's
    Auction House system, this method supports efficient configuration handling for
    auction bot operations without redundant memory allocations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the assigned AuctionBotConfig object, enabling chained assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'AuctionBotConfig config1;

      AuctionBotConfig config2 = std::move(config1); // Uses operator=

      // config1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'AuctionBotConfig config1, config2, config3;

      config1 = std::move(config2) = std::move(config3); // Chained move assignment

      // config2 and config3 are left in valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the C++ move semantics implementation for AuctionBotConfig.
    It should only be called on rvalue expressions or objects explicitly marked for
    moving using std::move(). The moved-from object must not be accessed after the
    operation unless it's immediately reassigned or destroyed.
  warnings: Using this operator on lvalue expressions can lead to unexpected behavior.
    Always use std::move() when explicitly wanting to move an object. Accessing the
    moved-from object after assignment results in undefined behavior, though the object
    remains in a valid state for destruction.
