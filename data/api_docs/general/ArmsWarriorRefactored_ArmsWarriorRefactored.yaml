  method: ArmsWarriorRefactored
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::ArmsWarriorRefactored(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Arms Warrior bot instance with the specified player character.
  description: The ArmsWarriorRefactored constructor initializes a new Arms Warrior
    AI bot by setting up its internal state and configuration based on the provided
    Player object. This method configures the bot's combat behavior, ability usage
    patterns, and tactical decision-making logic specific to the arms warrior specialization.
    The initialization process includes setting up action queues, defining priority
    sequences for abilities, and establishing the bot's overall fighting strategy.
    This constructor is typically called when creating a new AI-controlled arms warrior
    character within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Arms Warrior Bot Initialization
    code: 'Player* botPlayer = ...; // Get or create player instance

      ArmsWarriorRefactored armsBot(botPlayer);

      // The armsBot is now initialized and ready for combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor assumes that the Player object passed in has already been
    properly validated and configured. The initialization process may involve loading
    configuration files, setting up AI decision trees, and preparing ability cooldown
    tracking systems. Performance considerations include potential memory allocation
    for AI state tracking structures.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor without a valid Player pointer, as it will
    likely cause undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that the Player object is fully
    initialized before passing it to this constructor.
