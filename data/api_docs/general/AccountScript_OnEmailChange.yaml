  class: AccountScript
  method: OnEmailChange
  signature: void AccountScript::OnEmailChange(uint32 accountId)
documentation:
  brief: Called when an account's email address is changed in the database
  description: This method is invoked by the TrinityCore framework whenever an account's
    email address is updated within the database. It serves as a hook for script developers
    to execute custom logic, such as sending notifications, logging changes, or updating
    related systems when an account's email is modified. The method receives the unique
    account identifier as a parameter and is typically used in AccountScript subclasses
    to implement custom behavior upon email change events.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: The unique identifier of the account whose email address has been
      changed. This value corresponds to the 'id' field in the 'account' table of
      the auth database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Account Email Change Handler
    code: "class MyAccountScript : public AccountScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyAccountScript()\
      \ : AccountScript(\"MyAccountScript\") {}\n\n    void OnEmailChange(uint32 accountId)\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Log the email change event\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Email changed for account ID: %u\", accountId);\n        \n        // Optionally\
      \ send a notification to the player\n        if (Player* player = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayerByLowGUID(accountId))\n\
      \        {\n            player->SendNotification(\"Your email has been updated.\"\
      );\n        }\n    }\n};"

  notes: This method is called from the database update context, so any heavy operations
    should be deferred to avoid blocking the database transaction. It's recommended
    to use asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks.
  warnings: Do not perform database operations directly within this method unless
    absolutely necessary, as it may cause deadlocks or performance degradation. Avoid
    modifying account data in this callback without proper synchronization.
