  signature: void ScriptMgr::OnQuestAcknowledgeAutoAccept(Player * player, const Quest
    * quest)
documentation:
  brief: Invoked when a player acknowledges an auto-accepted quest in World of Warcraft.
  description: This method is called by the TrinityCore server whenever a player accepts
    a quest that was automatically accepted, typically through a quest giver's interaction
    or system event. It allows custom scripts to execute logic upon such automatic
    quest acceptance. The method does not return any value and serves as a notification
    mechanism for script handlers. This function is part of the general scripting
    interface used in TrinityCore to extend game behavior without modifying core code.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object who acknowledged the auto-accepted
      quest. Must not be null.
  - name: quest
    description: A pointer to the Quest object that was automatically accepted by
      the player. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyQuestScript : public QuestScript\n{\npublic:\n    void OnQuestAcknowledgeAutoAccept(Player*\
      \ player, const Quest* quest) override\n    {\n        // Log the event\n  \
      \      sLog->outString(\"Player %s auto-accepted quest %u.\", player->GetName(),\
      \ quest->GetQuestId());\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in custom quest scripts or modules where additional
    actions are required upon automatic quest acceptance. Ensure that the provided
    pointers are valid before using them to avoid runtime errors.
