  signature: int Player::GetBagSlotFlags(uint32 bagIndex) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the slot flags for a specified bag index in the player's inventory.
  description: The GetBagSlotFlags method retrieves the slot flags associated with
    a specific bag index within the player's inventory. This method is used to determine
    the valid slot positions for items within a particular bag, allowing developers
    to understand which slots are available for item placement. The function returns
    an integer representing the slot flags, which can be used to validate or manipulate
    bag slot configurations during gameplay. It is particularly useful in scenarios
    where players need to manage their inventory and ensure proper item placement
    within bags.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the slot flags for the specified
    bag index. The value indicates which slots are valid for items within that bag,
    with different bits representing different slot types (e.g., bag slots, equipped
    slots, etc.).
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int slotFlags = player->GetBagSlotFlags(0); // Get slot flags for bag index
      0
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with inventory management functions
    to determine valid slot positions. It may be affected by game mechanics such as
    bag capacity limits or item restrictions, and should be used carefully when manipulating
    player inventory.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect inventory configurations
    or item placement errors. Ensure that the bag index is within valid bounds before
    calling this method.
