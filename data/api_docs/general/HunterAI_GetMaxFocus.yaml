  method: GetMaxFocus
  signature: int HunterAI::GetMaxFocus() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum focus amount for the hunter.
  description: The GetMaxFocus method retrieves the maximum focus value that a hunter
    character can have. In World of Warcraft's Hunter class, focus is a resource used
    for casting certain abilities and spells. This method returns the base maximum
    focus value, which may be affected by various factors such as player level, gear,
    buffs, or talents. The returned value represents the upper limit of focus points
    that can be accumulated before reaching the maximum cap.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the maximum focus amount for the hunter. This value
    typically ranges from 100 to 150 depending on the hunter's level, equipment, and
    other game factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int maxFocus = hunterAI->GetMaxFocus();

      printf("Maximum focus: %d\n", maxFocus);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Focus Management Check
    code: "HunterAI* ai = dynamic_cast<HunterAI*>(unit->GetAI());\nif (ai)\n{\n  \
      \  int maxFocus = ai->GetMaxFocus();\n    int currentFocus = unit->GetPower(POWER_FOCUS);\n\
      \    if (currentFocus >= maxFocus)\n    {\n        // Hunter has maximum focus\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the base maximum focus value without considering temporary
    modifiers or buffs. The actual maximum focus may be higher due to temporary effects
    like talents, potions, or other game mechanics. This method is typically used
    in AI decision-making logic for determining when to use focus-based abilities.
  warnings: The returned value represents only the base maximum focus and does not
    account for temporary increases from buffs or talents. If you need the current
    effective maximum focus, you should consider combining this with other methods
    that check for active modifiers.
