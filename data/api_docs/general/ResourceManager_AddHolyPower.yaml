  class: ResourceManager
  method: AddHolyPower
  signature: void ResourceManager::AddHolyPower(uint32 power)
documentation:
  brief: Adds holy power to the resource manager, increasing the player's holy power
    accumulation.
  description: The AddHolyPower method increases the current holy power value stored
    within the ResourceManager instance by the specified amount. This method is typically
    used in gameplay mechanics where players gain holy power through abilities, spells,
    or other game actions. The holy power resource is commonly associated with classes
    like Paladins and other holy-based specializations in World of Warcraft. The method
    does not perform any validation on the input value, so it's expected that callers
    provide valid power amounts. This method modifies the internal state of the ResourceManager
    and may trigger updates to related UI elements or game mechanics that depend on
    holy power.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The amount of holy power to add to the current resource. Must be
      a non-negative integer value representing the power units to increment.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ResourceManager* rm = player->GetResourceManager();

      rm->AddHolyPower(10); // Adds 10 holy power units'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Ability Effects
    code: "void Player::OnSacredShieldCast()\n{\n    ResourceManager* rm = this->GetResourceManager();\n\
      \    uint32 holyPowerGained = 5;\n    rm->AddHolyPower(holyPowerGained);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal holy power counter. It is recommended
    to call this method only when the player has actually gained holy power through
    gameplay actions. The ResourceManager class likely handles synchronization of
    holy power changes with client-side UI updates, though this behavior is not explicitly
    defined in the method signature.
  warnings: Calling this method with a negative value may cause unexpected behavior
    if the internal counter is not designed to handle underflow. Ensure that the input
    power value is validated before calling to prevent unintended resource depletion
    or overflow issues.
