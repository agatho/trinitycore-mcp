  method: GetStatPercentageOfSocket
  signature: float ItemTemplate::GetStatPercentageOfSocket(uint32 index) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the percentage value of a stat associated with a socket in the item
    template.
  description: The GetStatPercentageOfSocket method retrieves the percentage modifier
    that a specific socketed gem would apply to a stat on the item. This value is
    typically used in the context of socketed gems that provide percentage-based bonuses,
    such as +X% Critical Strike or +Y% Haste. The method takes an index parameter
    which corresponds to a particular socket in the item's socket list. It returns
    0.0f if the specified socket does not have a percentage stat modifier associated
    with it. This functionality is essential for calculating the total stat bonuses
    of items that contain gem sockets.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the percentage bonus provided by the stat of
    the specified socket. Returns 0.0f if no percentage stat is associated with the
    socket or if the index is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve percentage bonus from a socket
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nfloat\
      \ percentage = itemTemplate->GetStatPercentageOfSocket(0);\nif (percentage >\
      \ 0.0f)\n{\n    // Process the percentage bonus\n    printf(\"Socket provides\
      \ %.2f%% stat bonus\\n\", percentage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in item processing and stat calculation systems
    within TrinityCore. The index parameter refers to the socket slot number, starting
    from 0. It's important to note that not all sockets will have percentage stat
    modifiers; some may only provide fixed stat bonuses or no bonus at all.
  warnings: Ensure that the index passed to this method is valid and within the bounds
    of the item's socket list to avoid undefined behavior. This method should not
    be called on items that do not support gem sockets, as it may return unexpected
    values.
