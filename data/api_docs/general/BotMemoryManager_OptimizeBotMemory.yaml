  class: BotMemoryManager
  method: OptimizeBotMemory
  signature: void BotMemoryManager::OptimizeBotMemory(uint32_t botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes memory usage for a specified bot by cleaning up unused data and
    reducing memory footprint.
  description: The OptimizeBotMemory method is responsible for performing memory cleanup
    operations on a specific bot identified by its GUID. This function typically removes
    redundant or stale data from the bot's memory structures, such as outdated AI
    decision trees, cached paths, or unnecessary object references. The optimization
    process helps reduce memory consumption and can improve overall server performance,
    especially in environments with many active bots. This method is usually invoked
    periodically or when a bot's memory usage exceeds certain thresholds. It ensures
    that bots maintain efficient memory utilization without affecting their core functionality
    or behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to optimize. This value must
      correspond to an existing bot in the system, otherwise the operation will have
      no effect.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeBotMemory
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotMemoryManager::OptimizeBotMemory(botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Optimizing multiple bots in a loop
    code: "std::vector<uint32_t> botGuids = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32_t guid\
      \ : botGuids)\n{\n    BotMemoryManager::OptimizeBotMemory(guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the server's memory management system
    or through periodic cleanup routines. It may temporarily pause certain bot activities
    during optimization to ensure data consistency. The operation is non-blocking
    but can cause a slight performance dip during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent bot GUID will result
    in no action being taken, but it's important to validate the GUID beforehand to
    avoid unnecessary overhead. Repeated calls on the same bot without sufficient
    time between them may not provide additional benefits.
