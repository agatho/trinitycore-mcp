  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: PublishSpawnCompleted
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::PublishSpawnCompleted(int botGuid, bool success,
    const std::string & details)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies subscribers that a bot spawn operation has completed with success
    status and optional details.
  description: The PublishSpawnCompleted method is used to broadcast an event indicating
    that a bot spawn operation has finished. This method is typically invoked by the
    bot management system when a bot creation or respawn process is complete, providing
    information about whether the operation succeeded and any relevant details. The
    event is published through the BotSpawnEventBus, allowing other systems or modules
    to react to spawn completion events. This mechanism supports asynchronous communication
    between different components of the TrinityCore-based World of Warcraft server,
    particularly in bot-related subsystems where coordination between spawning logic
    and external listeners is required.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that was spawned or attempted
      to be spawned. This value represents the internal ID used by the server to track
      the specific bot instance.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the bot spawn operation completed
      successfully. True indicates successful completion, false indicates failure.
  - name: details
    description: A string containing additional information about the spawn operation
      result. This may include error messages, status descriptions, or other diagnostic
      information that can help in debugging or monitoring bot spawning activities.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of PublishSpawnCompleted
    code: BotSpawnEventBus::GetInstance()->PublishSpawnCompleted(12345, true, "Bot
      spawned successfully");
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling failed bot spawn with details
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus::GetInstance()->PublishSpawnCompleted(67890, false, "Failed
      to spawn bot: Invalid position");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the bot spawning subsystem
    and should not be invoked directly by external modules unless specifically intended.
    The event bus implementation may use a thread-safe queue for event delivery, but
    subscribers should ensure their handlers are thread-safe if they access shared
    resources. The method does not perform any validation on the input parameters
    beyond basic type checking.
  warnings: Ensure that all subscribers to the BotSpawnEventBus properly handle both
    success and failure cases. Improper handling of failed spawns may lead to inconsistent
    bot states or unhandled exceptions in the server's event processing loop.
