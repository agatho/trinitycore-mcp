documentation:
  brief: Clears all combat state from the unit, removing any active combat engagements.
  description: The ClearInCombat method removes all combat-related states from a Unit
    object, effectively ending any active combat engagements. This method is typically
    used to reset a unit's combat status after combat has ended or when transitioning
    between different combat scenarios. It ensures that the unit no longer maintains
    any combat-related flags or state information, allowing for clean transitions
    in game mechanics. The method is particularly useful in scenarios where units
    need to be reset from combat state without necessarily being removed from combat
    entirely.

  notes: This method typically resets combat state flags and may also clear related
    combat information such as threat levels or combat engagement status. Implementation
    details include ensuring that the unit's combat state is properly reset, which
    may involve clearing internal combat-related data structures.
