documentation:
  brief: Updates the rogue's buff states and applies relevant abilities based on current
    combat conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method manages the application, removal, and updating
    of all active buffs for a Rogue AI character. This includes checking for buff
    expiration, applying new buffs based on combat state, and ensuring that the rogue
    maintains optimal buff configurations during encounters. The method evaluates
    various factors such as target status, available resources, and tactical positioning
    to determine which buffs should be active or refreshed. It integrates with the
    core AI decision-making system to ensure that buff management aligns with overall
    combat strategy.

  notes: This method is typically called as part of the main AI update cycle and should
    not be invoked independently without proper AI context. The implementation may
    vary based on specific rogue specialization (e.g., Subtlety, Combat, Assassination)
    and current encounter phase.
