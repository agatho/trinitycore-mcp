  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: FocusTarget
  signature: void GroupCoordinator::FocusTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the focus target for the group coordinator to the specified unit.
  description: The FocusTarget method assigns a specific Unit as the focus target
    for the GroupCoordinator. This target is typically used in group-based gameplay
    mechanics such as raid coordination, targeting synchronization, or quest-related
    objectives. The method does not validate whether the target is within range or
    eligible for focusing; it simply sets the internal reference. If the provided
    target is null, the focus target may be cleared or left unchanged depending on
    implementation details. This functionality is commonly used in group-based AI
    systems where coordinated actions require a shared focus point.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will become the focus target. If
      null, the current focus target may be cleared or remain unchanged.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Focus Target
    code: "Unit* target = player->GetMap()->GetCreature(12345);\nif (target)\n{\n\
      \    groupCoordinator->FocusTarget(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing Focus Target
    code: groupCoordinator->FocusTarget(nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely updates internal state within the GroupCoordinator class
    and may trigger events or notifications to other subsystems. It is assumed that
    this method is part of a larger group management system, possibly integrated with
    World of Warcraft's raid and party frameworks.
  warnings: Ensure that the target Unit pointer is valid before calling this method;
    passing a null pointer may lead to undefined behavior or internal state corruption
    depending on implementation details.
