  class: Unit
  method: IsAreaSpiritHealer
  signature: bool Unit::IsAreaSpiritHealer() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit is an area spirit healer.
  description: This method checks if the current unit is an area spirit healer, which
    is a type of NPC that can resurrect players in the same zone. The method returns
    true when the unit's creature template has the Area Spirit Healer flag set, indicating
    it can perform resurrection operations within its area. This functionality is
    crucial for player resurrection mechanics and is commonly used in player vs player
    scenarios where players can be resurrected by nearby spirit healers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is an area spirit healer, false otherwise. The
    method returns false for non-creature units or creatures that do not have the
    Area Spirit Healer flag set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsAreaSpiritHealer())\n{\n    // Perform resurrection logic\n\
      }\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the creature template flags to determine if a unit
    is an area spirit healer. It should be used in conjunction with other resurrection-related
    methods for complete functionality.
  warnings: This method may not work correctly for non-creature units, and should
    only be used with creatures that have proper template flags set.
