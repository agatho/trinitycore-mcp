documentation:
  brief: Ends the current combat state for the group coordination instance
  description: The EndCombat method terminates the active combat session within a
    GroupCoordination object. This method is typically invoked when a group's combat
    engagement has concluded, such as after defeating a boss or completing a dungeon
    encounter. It handles cleanup of combat-related data structures and ensures that
    all group members are properly transitioned out of combat state. The method may
    also trigger related events or callbacks to notify other systems about the end
    of combat. This is an essential part of maintaining proper game state management
    during group-based activities in World of Warcraft.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupCoordination* coord = sGroupCoordination->GetGroupCoordination(groupId);\n\
      if (coord)\n{\n    coord->EndCombat();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when combat is actually concluded. Calling
    it prematurely may result in inconsistent group state or missing combat events.
    The implementation likely handles synchronization between multiple threads and
    ensures all group members' combat states are properly updated.
  warnings: Do not call this method if combat has not started, as it may lead to undefined
    behavior or assertion failures. Always verify that the GroupCoordination instance
    is valid before calling EndCombat().
