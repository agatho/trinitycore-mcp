documentation:
  brief: Destroys the startup spawn orchestrator instance and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The ~StartupSpawnOrchestrator destructor is responsible for cleaning
    up all resources allocated during the initialization and spawning process of game
    objects. This includes releasing memory, unregistering callbacks, and ensuring
    that no dangling references remain in the system. The method is automatically
    invoked when an instance of StartupSpawnOrchestrator goes out of scope or is explicitly
    deleted. It ensures proper shutdown of any ongoing spawn operations and maintains
    the integrity of the server's object management system during server startup sequences.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of orchestrator instance
    code: 'StartupSpawnOrchestrator* orchestrator = new StartupSpawnOrchestrator();

      // ... perform spawn operations ...

      delete orchestrator; // Triggers ~StartupSpawnOrchestrator()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This destructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework
    during server shutdown or when cleaning up temporary spawn managers. Developers
    should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing custom resource
    management logic.
