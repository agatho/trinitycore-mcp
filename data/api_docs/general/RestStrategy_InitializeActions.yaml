documentation:
  brief: Initializes the rest strategy actions for the player's AI behavior.
  description: The InitializeActions method sets up the initial action list for the
    RestStrategy class, which governs how a player or NPC behaves when resting. This
    typically involves configuring the sequence of actions that will be executed during
    rest periods, such as healing, mana regeneration, or other passive behaviors.
    The method is called internally by the AI system to prepare the strategy before
    it begins influencing the character's behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI initialization
    code: "void SomeAI::OnInitialize()\n{\n    restStrategy.InitializeActions();\n\
      \    // Rest strategy is now ready to manage resting behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization phase of
    a strategy. It typically sets up internal action queues and state variables that
    define how the AI will behave while resting.
