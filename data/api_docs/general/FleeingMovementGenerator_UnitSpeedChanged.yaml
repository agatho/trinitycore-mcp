documentation:
  brief: Updates the fleeing movement generator when the unit's speed changes.
  description: The UnitSpeedChanged method is called when a unit's movement speed
    is modified while it is under the influence of a fleeing behavior. This method
    ensures that the fleeing movement generator adjusts its internal state and path
    calculations to reflect the new speed, maintaining consistent flee behavior regardless
    of speed modifications such as those caused by spells, effects, or environmental
    changes. It typically recalculates movement parameters like distance to flee from
    the target and update the movement timer accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update
    code: "void FleeingAI::UpdateAI(Unit* who)\n{\n    if (who && me->IsInCombat())\n\
      \    {\n        // Trigger speed change handling\n        if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_SPEED_CHANGE))\n\
      \        {\n            m_fleeGenerator.UnitSpeedChanged();\n        }\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the movement system when a
    unit's speed changes during fleeing. Developers should not call this directly
    unless implementing custom movement logic that modifies unit speed while fleeing.
  warnings: Do not manually invoke UnitSpeedChanged unless you are extending or modifying
    the base fleeing behavior. Incorrect usage may lead to inconsistent flee paths
    or unexpected movement behavior.
