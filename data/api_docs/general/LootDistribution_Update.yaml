documentation:
  brief: Updates the loot distribution state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method processes the internal state of a LootDistribution
    object, typically handling time-based events such as loot rolling timeouts or
    distribution scheduling. It is called regularly by the game loop to ensure that
    loot distributions progress correctly according to their defined rules and timing
    parameters. This method may trigger notifications, finalize loot assignments,
    or clean up expired distributions.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: 'LootDistribution* distribution = ...;

      distribution->Update(1000); // Update with 1 second elapsed time'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently, typically every game tick or at
    regular intervals defined by the game loop. It is not thread-safe and must be
    invoked from the main game thread.
  warnings: Calling this method with incorrect time values can cause unexpected behavior
    in loot distribution timing and may lead to invalid loot assignments.
