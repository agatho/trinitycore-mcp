  signature: void BotScheduler::ScheduleAction(const ScheduleEntry & entry)
documentation:
  brief: Schedules a bot action to be executed at a specified time or under certain
    conditions.
  description: The ScheduleAction method is used to register a bot action with the
    scheduler, allowing it to be executed at a later time or in response to specific
    events. This method takes a ScheduleEntry object that defines when and how the
    action should be performed. The scheduling mechanism is typically used for managing
    AI behavior timing, such as casting spells, moving to positions, or performing
    other actions based on game state or timers. The method integrates with the bot's
    overall scheduling system to ensure proper execution order and avoid conflicts.
  parameters:
  - name: entry
    description: A ScheduleEntry object containing the details of the action to be
      scheduled, including timing information, action type, and associated data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Action Scheduling
    code: 'ScheduleEntry entry;

      entry.actionType = ActionType::CAST_SPELL;

      entry.delay = 5000; // 5 seconds

      entry.targetGuid = targetGuid;

      entry.spellId = 12345;

      scheduler.ScheduleAction(entry);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Scheduling a Movement Action
    code: 'ScheduleEntry entry;

      entry.actionType = ActionType::MOVE_TO_POSITION;

      entry.delay = 0; // Execute immediately

      entry.position = Position{x, y, z, o};

      scheduler.ScheduleAction(entry);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by bot AI logic to queue actions for execution.
    The actual execution of scheduled actions occurs in the scheduler's update loop,
    which processes entries based on their timing and priority. Multiple actions can
    be scheduled simultaneously, and they will be executed according to their defined
    delays or conditions.
  warnings: Care should be taken when scheduling actions with very short delays (less
    than 10ms) as this may cause performance issues or unexpected behavior. Also,
    ensure that all required data in the ScheduleEntry is properly initialized before
    calling this method to avoid undefined behavior.
