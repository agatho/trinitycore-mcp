documentation:
  brief: Records a player death event for statistics tracking purposes.
  description: The RecordDeath method is used to log and track player deaths within
    the DeathRecoveryStatistics system. This method typically increments internal
    counters or updates statistical records when a player dies, which may be used
    for various game mechanics such as death penalties, resurrection tracking, or
    player behavior analysis. The method does not take any parameters and performs
    its operation based on the current state of the DeathRecoveryStatistics instance
    and the context of the player's death event.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Death Handler
    code: "void Player::OnDeath()\n{\n    // ... death logic ...\n    sDeathRecoveryStats->RecordDeath();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called automatically by the core game loop or player
    death handler. It may be thread-safe depending on how the DeathRecoveryStatistics
    instance is managed, but should be used carefully in multithreaded contexts. The
    actual statistics tracking behavior depends on the implementation of the DeathRecoveryStatistics
    class.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when a player actually dies, as
    incorrect invocation may skew death statistics. Avoid calling this method multiple
    times for a single death event to prevent inflated counts.
