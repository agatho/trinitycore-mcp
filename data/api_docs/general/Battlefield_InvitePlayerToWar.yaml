  signature: void Battlefield::InvitePlayerToWar(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Invites a player to join the battlefield.
  description: The InvitePlayerToWar method is responsible for sending an invitation
    to a specific player to join the current battlefield instance. This method typically
    handles the logic required to notify the player of their invitation, update the
    battlefield's internal player list, and potentially adjust the player's game state
    or position within the battlefield environment. It is commonly used during battlefield
    initialization or when players are being added to an ongoing battlefield match.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that will be invited to join the battlefield.
      This parameter must not be null and should represent a valid player in the game
      world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage of InvitePlayerToWar
    code: "Battlefield* bf = sBattlefieldMgr->GetBattlefieldByInstanceId(12345);\n\
      if (bf)\n{\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(123456));\n\
      \    if (player)\n    {\n        bf->InvitePlayerToWar(player);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the battlefield instance is properly initialized
    and active. It may internally call other methods to update player status, send
    packets to the client, or adjust game state variables. The method does not validate
    whether the player is already in a battlefield or has already been invited.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided Player pointer is valid and not null before calling
    this method. Calling this method on an uninitialized or inactive battlefield instance
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
