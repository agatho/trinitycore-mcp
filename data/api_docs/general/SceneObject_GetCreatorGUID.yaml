  method: GetCreatorGUID
  signature: int SceneObject::GetCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the creator of the scene object.
  description: The GetCreatorGUID method retrieves the GUID of the entity that created
    the scene object. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, scene objects
    are typically used for visual effects, scripted events, or other game elements
    that may be associated with a specific creator such as a player, creature, or
    game object. This GUID can be used to identify and track the originating source
    of the scene object for gameplay logic, event handling, or debugging purposes.
    The method is read-only and does not modify any internal state of the SceneObject
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the creator. This GUID uniquely
    identifies the entity that created the scene object within the game world. If
    no creator has been set, the method may return a default or invalid GUID value
    (typically 0).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Creator GUID
    code: "SceneObject* sceneObj = ...; // Assume this is initialized\nint creatorGUID\
      \ = sceneObj->GetCreatorGUID();\nif (creatorGUID != 0)\n{\n    // Process the\
      \ creator GUID\n    sLog->outString(\"Scene object created by entity with GUID:\
      \ %u\", creatorGUID);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Creator GUID to Identify Player
    code: "SceneObject* sceneObj = ...;\nint creatorGUID = sceneObj->GetCreatorGUID();\n\
      if (creatorGUID != 0)\n{\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ creatorGUID));\n    if (player)\n    {\n        sLog->outString(\"Scene object\
      \ created by player: %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID is typically of type ObjectGuid, but this method returns
    an int for compatibility or simplification. Developers should be aware that the
    actual GUID may require conversion to a full ObjectGuid when performing lookups
    in the game world. This method assumes that the SceneObject has a valid creator
    set; otherwise, it will return 0.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity.
    If the scene object was not created by a known entity, the GUID may be zero or
    invalid, which could lead to errors if not handled properly. Always validate the
    GUID before performing operations that rely on it.
