documentation:
  brief: Initializes all warlock-specific professions and their associated data for
    a player
  description: The InitializeWarlockProfessions method sets up and configures all
    profession entries specific to warlocks within the TrinityCore framework. This
    includes loading base profession levels, unlocking profession abilities, setting
    up spell learning mechanics, and initializing any warlock-specific profession
    bonuses or requirements. The method is typically called during player login or
    profession initialization sequences to ensure warlock characters have proper access
    to their profession trees and associated gameplay mechanics. It handles internal
    data structures required for tracking warlock professions and ensures compatibility
    with the broader profession management system.

  - title: Basic Usage During Player Login
    code: "void Player::OnLogin()\n{\n    // ... other login logic ...\n    sProfessionManager->InitializeWarlockProfessions();\n\
      \    // ... continue with other initialization ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the player object is fully initialized
    and has been assigned a valid character ID. The method internally manages database
    synchronization for warlock profession data and may trigger additional callbacks
    for profession-related events. It's designed to be idempotent, meaning it can
    safely be called multiple times without adverse effects.
  warnings: Do not call this method before the player object is properly initialized
    with a valid account and character ID. Calling this method during critical gameplay
    states may cause unexpected behavior or data corruption if profession data conflicts
    occur.
