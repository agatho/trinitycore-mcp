  method: GetSettings
  signature: ThrottleSettings AdaptiveThrottler::GetSettings() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current throttling settings configuration from the AdaptiveThrottler
    instance.
  description: The GetSettings method returns a copy of the ThrottleSettings object
    that defines the current throttling behavior of the AdaptiveThrottler. This includes
    parameters such as maximum allowed requests, time windows, and rate limiting thresholds.
    The returned settings are immutable and represent a snapshot of the configuration
    at the time of the call. This method is typically used to inspect or log the current
    throttling policy without modifying it.
  parameters: []
  returns: A ThrottleSettings object containing the current throttling configuration
    parameters including limits, intervals, and enforcement policies.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Log Current Throttling Settings
    code: "AdaptiveThrottler throttler;\nThrottleSettings settings = throttler.GetSettings();\n\
      LOG_INFO(\"Throttling settings: MaxRequests=%u, TimeWindow=%u seconds\", \n\
      \        settings.MaxRequests, settings.TimeWindowSeconds);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned ThrottleSettings object is a copy and modifications to it will
    not affect the AdaptiveThrottler's internal configuration. This method is thread-safe
    and can be called from any thread without synchronization.
