documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is a spirit service, returning true if the unit is currently
    in spirit service mode.
  description: The IsSpiritService method determines whether a Unit object is currently
    in spirit service mode, which typically occurs when a player or creature is in
    a state where they are unable to perform normal actions but can still interact
    with the world in specific ways. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    related to spirit services, resurrection states, or when a unit is in a special
    state that prevents normal gameplay actions. The method returns true when the
    unit is in spirit service mode and false otherwise, indicating the unit's current
    state.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently in spirit service mode, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether the unit can perform normal actions or is restricted to
    specific spirit-related behaviors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsSpiritService()) {\n    // Unit is in spirit service mode\n\
      \    // Perform special handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal state flags or conditions related to spirit
    service states. Implementation may involve checking specific unit states or flags
    that are set when a unit enters spirit service mode.
  warnings: This method should not be used in contexts where normal gameplay actions
    are expected, as it may indicate the unit is unable to perform regular actions.
    Be cautious when using this method in conjunction with other state checks.
