  signature: float DetectionMetrics::GetDetectionRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the detection rate of a unit within the game world.
  description: The GetDetectionRate method computes the likelihood that a unit (such
    as a player or creature) will be detected by other units in the game world. This
    value is typically used in stealth mechanics, visibility calculations, and AI
    behavior decisions. The detection rate is influenced by factors such as the unit's
    stealth level, surrounding environmental conditions, and the detecting unit's
    perception abilities. The method performs no side effects and returns a floating-point
    value representing the detection probability between 0.0 (fully hidden) and 1.0
    (fully visible).
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates complete invisibility
    (no chance of detection), and 1.0 indicates full visibility (guaranteed detection).
    Values in between represent partial detection probabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float detectionRate = unit->GetDetectionRate();\nif (detectionRate < 0.5f)\n\
      {\n    // Unit is mostly hidden\n    // Apply stealth effects or reduce visibility\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining Visibility for AI
    code: "Unit* target = ...;\nfloat rate = target->GetDetectionRate();\nif (rate\
      \ > 0.7f)\n{\n    // Target is highly visible, AI can engage\n    ai->SetTarget(target);\n\
      }\nelse if (rate < 0.3f)\n{\n    // Target is nearly invisible, AI should avoid\
      \ or search\n    ai->SearchForTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be called frequently during game updates, especially in AI
    systems and visibility checks. It's recommended to cache the result if it's used
    multiple times within a single frame or update cycle to avoid redundant calculations.
  warnings: The detection rate returned by this method is not a direct boolean value
    but rather a probability. Developers should account for randomness or threshold
    comparisons when implementing logic based on this value. Additionally, the actual
    detection behavior may also depend on other systems like line-of-sight checks
    and game rules.
