  class: ThreatCoordinator
  method: ProcessThreatResponses
  signature: void ThreatCoordinator::ProcessThreatResponses()
documentation:
  brief: Processes threat responses for units in the threat coordinator's management.
  description: The ProcessThreatResponses method handles the internal logic for updating
    and managing threat levels among units within the ThreatCoordinator system. It
    iterates through registered units, evaluates their current threat states, and
    applies appropriate response behaviors such as aggro updates, threat recalculations,
    or unit targeting adjustments. This method is typically called during the game's
    update cycle to ensure that NPC behavior remains consistent with the current threat
    dynamics in combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Update Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    threatCoordinator.ProcessThreatResponses();\n\
      \    // ... more update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is expected to be invoked regularly during the game loop, typically
    every tick or at fixed intervals, to maintain accurate threat state tracking.
    It may involve internal locking mechanisms for thread safety in multi-threaded
    environments.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of the intended update cycle may result in
    inconsistent threat states or unexpected behavior in combat systems. Avoid calling
    it during critical sections where unit states are being modified externally.
