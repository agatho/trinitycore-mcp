documentation:
  brief: Resets all internal metrics and counters used by the MechanicAwareness class
    to their default values.
  description: The ResetMetrics method clears and reinitializes all tracking data
    within the MechanicAwareness class. This includes resetting any accumulated statistics,
    counters, or performance measurements that have been recorded since the object
    was initialized or last reset. The method ensures a clean state for subsequent
    monitoring or analysis operations. It is typically invoked when starting a new
    observation period or when the system needs to discard previous metric data. No
    parameters are required as the operation affects only internal state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'MechanicAwareness awareness;

      awareness.ResetMetrics();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully in performance-critical sections as
    it may involve resetting internal data structures. It is not thread-safe and should
    only be used when no other threads are accessing the MechanicAwareness instance.
  warnings: Calling ResetMetrics while active monitoring or tracking is in progress
    may lead to loss of important metric data. Ensure that this method is called during
    appropriate synchronization points.
