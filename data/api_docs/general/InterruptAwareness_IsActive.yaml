documentation:
  brief: Checks if the interrupt awareness state is currently active
  description: The IsActive method determines whether the InterruptAwareness system
    is currently enabled or active. This functionality is typically used in game mechanics
    to control when certain actions or behaviors should respond to interrupts, such
    as spell casting interruptions or movement cancellations. The method performs
    a simple boolean check on an internal state variable that tracks the awareness
    status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the interrupt awareness system is currently active, false
    otherwise
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check interrupt awareness state
    code: "if (interruptAwareness.IsActive()) {\n    // Perform actions that require\
      \ active interrupt awareness\n    DoInterruptibleAction();\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Handle case when awareness is not active\n    HandleInactiveAwareness();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other interrupt-related
    systems and should be called frequently to ensure up-to-date state information.
    The internal state may be modified by various game events or system updates.
