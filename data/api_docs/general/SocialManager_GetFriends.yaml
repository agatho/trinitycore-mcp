documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of friends in the player's social list
  description: The GetFriends method returns the count of friends currently registered
    in the player's social manager. This value represents the total number of entries
    in the friend list, excluding ignored players or other social types. The method
    does not perform any database operations itself but rather returns a cached value
    from the internal social list structure. It is commonly used to determine how
    many friends are available for interaction or to validate the size of the social
    list before performing operations on it.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of friends in the player's social
    list. Returns 0 if the friend list is empty or if the player has no friends added.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Friend Count
    code: "int friendCount = player->GetSocial()->GetFriends();\nif (friendCount >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Player has friends, proceed with social interactions\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Player has %d friends.\", friendCount);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No friends in the\
      \ list\n    sLog->outString(\"Player has no friends.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses cached data and does not trigger database queries. It
    is safe to call frequently, but results may be stale if the friend list was modified
    without refreshing the cache.
