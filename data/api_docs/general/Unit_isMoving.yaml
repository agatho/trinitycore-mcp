  signature: bool Unit::isMoving() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns whether the unit is currently moving.
  description: The isMoving method checks if a Unit object is actively moving, which
    can be either a player or an NPC. This method is commonly used in game mechanics
    to determine the current state of movement for units within the World of Warcraft
    environment. It returns true when the unit is moving and false when it is not
    moving. The method is particularly useful for determining if a unit is performing
    actions such as running, walking, or other movement-based activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently moving, false otherwise. This indicates
    that the unit has active movement state and is not stationary.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->isMoving()) {\n    // Unit is moving\n    // Do something\n}\n\
      else {\n    // Unit is not moving\n    // Do something else\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal movement state tracking within TrinityCore.
    It may be affected by various factors including movement speed, animation states,
    and game mechanics such as flight paths or swimming.
  warnings: This method does not account for movement interruptions caused by combat
    or other external factors; it only reflects the current movement state of the
    unit.
