  signature: void Guild::HandleRemoveMember(WorldSession * session, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a member from the guild based on the provided GUID.
  description: The HandleRemoveMember method is responsible for removing a player
    from a guild. It takes a WorldSession pointer and a GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the target player to be removed. This method typically gets invoked when a
    guild leader or officer issues a command to kick a member from the guild. The
    operation involves validating the requester's permissions, ensuring the target
    is a valid guild member, and then executing the removal process which includes
    updating internal guild data structures and notifying relevant parties. The method
    does not return any value as it performs an in-place modification of the guild
    state.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object representing the player who initiated
      the remove request. Used to verify permissions and send responses back to the
      client.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the Global Unique Identifier of the guild
      member to be removed. Must correspond to a valid player in the current guild
      context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Guild* myGuild = session->GetPlayer()->GetGuild();\nif (myGuild)\n{\n \
      \   myGuild->HandleRemoveMember(session, targetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling session has sufficient privileges to
    remove members from the guild. It is expected that permission checks are performed
    before invoking this method. The actual removal process may involve database updates
    and broadcast messages to other guild members.
  warnings: Ensure that the GUID passed corresponds to a valid guild member, otherwise
    undefined behavior may occur. Also, make sure the session has proper authority
    (leader or officer) to perform the action; otherwise, the operation might fail
    silently or result in an error message being sent to the client.
