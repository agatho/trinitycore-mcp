documentation:
  brief: Returns the first controlled unit in the player's group or raid
  description: This method retrieves the first controlled unit that the current Unit
    (typically a player) has control over. It is commonly used to access the player's
    pet, vehicle, or other controlled units within the game world. The method returns
    a pointer to the first controlled unit, which can be null if no controlled units
    exist. This functionality is essential for managing player-controlled entities
    and their interactions with the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the first controlled unit, or nullptr if no controlled
    units exist. The returned unit may represent a pet, vehicle, or other controlled
    entity depending on the context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* controlledUnit = player->GetFirstControlled();\nif (controlledUnit)\n\
      {\n    // Use the controlled unit\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with pet
    code: "Unit* controlledUnit = player->GetFirstControlled();\nif (controlledUnit\
      \ && controlledUnit->IsPet())\n{\n    Pet* pet = dynamic_cast<Pet*>(controlledUnit);\n\
      \    // Perform actions on the pet\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other control-related methods
    to manage player-controlled entities. The returned unit may be null if no controlled
    units exist, and care should be taken when using this method in scenarios where
    multiple controlled units might exist.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in contexts where multiple controlled
    units may exist; the method returns only the first one. Also, ensure that the
    returned pointer is valid before dereferencing it to avoid memory access violations.
