  class: SoulShardSystem
  method: Generate
  signature: void SoulShardSystem::Generate(float amount)
documentation:
  brief: Generates soul shards for the player based on a specified amount.
  description: The Generate method in the SoulShardSystem class is responsible for
    creating or adding soul shards to a player's inventory. This method typically
    corresponds to gameplay mechanics where players earn soul shards through combat,
    quest completion, or other in-game activities. The amount parameter controls how
    many soul shards are generated, and this value is usually derived from game rules
    or effects such as spell casts, pet actions, or consumable item usage. The method
    does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the soul shard system
    for the associated player.
  parameters:
  - name: amount
    description: A floating-point value representing the quantity of soul shards to
      be generated. This value can be positive or negative, with positive values increasing
      the shard count and negative values decreasing it. Valid range depends on game
      balance parameters and internal limits.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SoulShardSystem system;

      system.Generate(5.0f); // Generates 5 soul shards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reducing Soul Shards
    code: 'SoulShardSystem system;

      system.Generate(-2.0f); // Removes 2 soul shards from the player''s inventory'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's current soul shard count and
    may trigger UI updates or events when shards are added or removed. It is expected
    to be called during gameplay events such as successful spell casts, pet actions,
    or quest rewards.
  warnings: Ensure that negative amounts do not result in a negative shard count;
    the system should enforce minimum limits to prevent invalid states. Improper use
    of this method could lead to inconsistent player progression or UI glitches.
