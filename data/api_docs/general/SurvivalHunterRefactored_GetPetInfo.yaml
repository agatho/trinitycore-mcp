documentation:
  brief: Retrieves and returns the current pet information identifier for the survival
    hunter.
  description: The GetPetInfo method is designed to fetch the unique identifier or
    status code associated with the hunter's current pet. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this method likely retrieves data about the active
    pet such as its GUID, health status, or behavioral state. This information is
    crucial for managing pet-related actions, AI behavior, and interaction logic within
    survival hunter gameplay mechanics. The method does not accept any parameters
    and returns an integer value representing the pet's current state or identifier.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value that represents the pet's current status or unique identifier.
    Possible values may include a GUID (Global Unique Identifier) for the pet, a status
    code indicating pet condition (e.g., alive, dead, dismissed), or an index within
    a pet management system. The exact meaning of return values depends on internal
    implementation and game logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int petInfo = hunter.GetPetInfo();\nif (petInfo > 0) {\n    // Pet is active\
      \ and has a valid identifier\n    std::cout << \"Pet ID: \" << petInfo << std::endl;\n\
      } else {\n    // No pet or invalid state\n    std::cout << \"No active pet\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system for handling hunter pet
    behavior. It may be called frequently during combat or pet management updates,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The return value
    may vary depending on whether the pet is summoned, dismissed, or has specific
    conditions.
  warnings: Ensure that the hunter object is properly initialized and that a pet exists
    before calling this method to avoid undefined behavior. The integer return value
    should not be assumed to have fixed meaning across different TrinityCore versions
    or patches.
