  brief: Loads player skills from database with specified result
  description: The _LoadSkill method is responsible for loading a player's skill information
    from the database based on the provided result parameter. This method typically
    handles the retrieval and initialization of skill data including skill levels,
    ranks, and associated values. It is part of the player's initialization process
    and ensures that skills are properly loaded before the player can use them in-game.
    The method may be called during character creation or when a player logs in to
    ensure all skill information is correctly populated.
  parameters:
  - name: result
    description: The database result set containing skill data to load. This parameter
      typically represents the result of a SQL query that fetches skill information
      from the database.
  returns: null

    code: "void Player::_LoadSkill(int result)\n{\n    // Implementation details\n\
      \    // Load skill data from database result\n}\nPlayer player;\nplayer._LoadSkill(0);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called only after the database connection is established
    and valid. The method may involve multiple database queries depending on the skill
    type being loaded. Performance considerations include potential database load
    operations that could impact server performance if not handled properly.
  warnings: The method requires proper database result handling to avoid memory corruption
    or data inconsistency. Incorrect handling of the result parameter can lead to
    invalid skill data being loaded, potentially causing game mechanics issues or
    crashes.
