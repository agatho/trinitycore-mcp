documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the LFG bot manager, cleaning up resources and stopping all active
    operations.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing processes within the LFGBotManager,
    ensuring proper cleanup of allocated resources and halting any active LFG (Looking
    for Group) bot operations. This method is typically invoked during server shutdown
    or when the LFG bot functionality needs to be temporarily disabled. It ensures
    that no dangling references or active threads remain, preventing potential memory
    leaks or undefined behavior. The method performs internal cleanup tasks such as
    stopping timers, closing connections, and releasing any held resources. It is
    designed to be idempotent, meaning it can safely be called multiple times without
    causing adverse effects.

    code: 'LFGBotManager* lfgBotManager = LFGBotManager::instance();

      lfgBotManager->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a state where it's
    safe to terminate all LFG bot operations. It is recommended to ensure that no
    active LFG queues or player sessions are currently being managed by the bot manager
    before invoking this function.
