  brief: Removes a character ban from the database by character name
  description: The RemoveBanCharacter method removes a previously applied ban on a
    character from the database. This function is typically used by administrative
    tools or commands to lift restrictions placed on a player's character. The method
    searches for an active ban record associated with the specified character name
    and deletes it from the ban list. If no ban exists for the character, the operation
    has no effect. This method interacts directly with the database to ensure consistency
    between the in-game state and persistent storage.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The exact case-sensitive name of the character whose ban is to be
      removed. Must correspond to a valid character that currently exists in the database.
  returns: Returns true if the ban was successfully found and removed from the database;
    returns false if no active ban was found for the specified character or if an
    error occurred during the database operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sWorld->RemoveBanCharacter(\"PlayerName\")) {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Successfully unbanned character PlayerName.\");\n} else {\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      No active ban found for character PlayerName.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Command Handler
    code: "void HandleUnbanCharacterCommand(ChatHandler* handler, const char* args)\
      \ {\n    if (!*args) {\n        handler->SendSysMessage(\"Usage: .unban character\
      \ <name>\");\n        return;\n    }\n    std::string name = args;\n    if (sWorld->RemoveBanCharacter(name))\
      \ {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"Character %s has been unbanned.\", name.c_str());\n\
      \    } else {\n        handler->PSendSysMessage(\"No active ban found for character\
      \ %s.\", name.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct database operation and may have performance
    implications when called frequently. It is recommended to use this function only
    in administrative contexts where immediate database consistency is required. The
    method assumes that the character name provided is valid and exists in the database.
  warnings: Ensure that the character name passed matches exactly with the one stored
    in the database, including case sensitivity. Incorrectly formatted names may result
    in failed lookups. This function does not validate whether the character is currently
    online or offline; it only operates on the database records.
