  brief: Retrieves the current spawn statistics for the bot spawner.
  description: The GetStatistics method returns a SpawnStatistics object containing
    detailed information about the current state of the bot spawner. This includes
    data such as total spawns, active bots, failed spawn attempts, and other relevant
    metrics that help monitor and analyze the performance of the bot spawning system
    within TrinityCore. The returned statistics are read-only and reflect the cumulative
    counts since the spawner was initialized or last reset.
  parameters: []
  returns: A SpawnStatistics object containing key-value pairs representing various
    spawn-related metrics, including total spawns, active bots, failed attempts, and
    other operational data.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and display bot spawning statistics
    code: 'BotSpawnerOptimized spawner;

      SpawnStatistics stats = spawner.GetStatistics();

      std::cout << "Total Spawns: " << stats.totalSpawns << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Active Bots: " << stats.activeBots << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread without risk
    of data corruption. The statistics are updated in real-time as spawns occur, making
    it suitable for live monitoring or logging purposes.
