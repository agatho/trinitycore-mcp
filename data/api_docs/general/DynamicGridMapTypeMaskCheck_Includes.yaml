  class: DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck
  method: Includes
  signature: bool DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck::Includes(int mapTypeMask) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the specified map type mask is included in the dynamic grid map
    type mask check.
  description: The Includes method determines whether a given map type mask is contained
    within the current dynamic grid map type mask check configuration. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to filter and validate map
    types for various game systems such as instance management, zone handling, or
    object placement. The method performs a bitwise operation to evaluate inclusion
    of the provided mask value within the internal mask structure. It returns true
    if the specified map type is included, false otherwise. This check is essential
    for ensuring that objects or operations are only performed on valid map types
    according to the defined criteria.
  parameters:
  - name: mapTypeMask
    description: An integer representing the map type mask to check for inclusion.
      This value typically corresponds to predefined map type constants used in TrinityCore's
      map system, such as MAP_TYPE_NORMAL, MAP_TYPE_DUNGEON, etc.
  returns: Returns true if the specified mapTypeMask is included in the dynamic grid
    map type mask check configuration; otherwise returns false. A return value of
    true indicates that the provided map type is valid for the current context or
    system being evaluated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if a map type is included
    code: "DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck maskCheck;\n// Assume maskCheck has been initialized\
      \ with some mask values\nbool isValid = maskCheck.Includes(MAP_TYPE_DUNGEON);\n\
      if (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with dungeon-specific operations\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Includes in conditional logic for instance handling
    code: "void HandleMapObject(GameObject* go)\n{\n    DynamicGridMapTypeMaskCheck\
      \ maskCheck;\n    // Initialize with appropriate map type masks\n    \n    if\
      \ (maskCheck.Includes(go->GetMap()->GetMapId()))\n    {\n        // Process\
      \ object for this map type\n        go->SetVisible(true);\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        // Skip processing for unsupported map types\n        go->SetVisible(false);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a bitwise AND operation internally to determine mask
    inclusion. The implementation assumes that the internal mask structure is properly
    initialized before calling this method. Performance is generally O(1) due to the
    direct bitwise comparison, making it suitable for frequent checks in game loops.
  warnings: Ensure that the mapTypeMask parameter contains valid map type constants
    as defined in TrinityCore's map system. Passing invalid or uninitialized mask
    values may lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect inclusion results.
