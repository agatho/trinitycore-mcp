  class: PositionManager
  method: AnalyzeThreatLevel
  signature: float PositionManager::AnalyzeThreatLevel(const int & pos, const int
    & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and returns the threat level associated with a given position and
    threat value.
  description: The AnalyzeThreatLevel method evaluates the threat level at a specific
    position within the game world, taking into account both the position identifier
    and an associated threat value. This function is typically used in AI pathfinding
    or threat assessment systems to determine how dangerous a location is for a creature
    or player. The method processes the input parameters to compute a normalized float
    value representing the calculated threat level. It assumes valid inputs and does
    not perform explicit validation, so callers should ensure that pos and threats
    are within expected ranges before invoking this function.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: An integer identifier representing a specific position in the game
      world. This could be a coordinate index, node ID, or other positional reference
      used internally by the AI system.
  - name: threats
    description: An integer value indicating the base threat level or intensity at
      the specified position. This may represent direct damage potential, enemy proximity,
      or other game-specific threat metrics.
  returns: A float value representing the computed threat level for the given position
    and threat input. The result is typically normalized to a range that allows comparison
    between different positions, with higher values indicating more dangerous locations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: float threatLevel = positionManager.AnalyzeThreatLevel(1001, 50);
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Decision Making
    code: "int currentPos = player->GetPositionX();\nint threatValue = enemy->GetThreat();\n\
      float analyzedThreat = positionManager.AnalyzeThreatLevel(currentPos, threatValue);\n\
      if (analyzedThreat > 0.7f) {\n    // Avoid this area\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger threat assessment system and may be
    called frequently during AI updates. Performance considerations should be taken
    into account if used in tight loops or real-time pathfinding calculations. The
    implementation is assumed to be thread-safe, but this depends on the underlying
    data structures used internally.
  warnings: The method does not validate its inputs, so passing invalid pos or threats
    values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. Ensure that these
    parameters are within expected bounds before calling the function.
