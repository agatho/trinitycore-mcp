  class: LootAnalysis
  method: UpdateStatWeights
  signature: void LootAnalysis::UpdateStatWeights(uint8 playerClass, uint8 playerSpec,
    const StatWeights & weights)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the stat weights for a specific player class and specialization within
    the loot analysis system.
  description: The UpdateStatWeights method is responsible for setting or modifying
    the statistical weight values associated with a particular player class and specialization.
    These weights are used by the loot analysis system to evaluate and rank potential
    loot items based on their contribution to the player's performance in that specific
    role. The method accepts a StatWeights structure containing the updated weight
    values, which are then stored and utilized for subsequent loot evaluations. This
    functionality is crucial for maintaining accurate and relevant loot recommendations
    tailored to each class and spec combination.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: The player's class identifier (e.g., CLASS_WARRIOR, CLASS_MAGE).
      Must be a valid class enum value.
  - name: playerSpec
    description: The player's specialization identifier. Must correspond to a valid
      spec for the given player class.
  - name: weights
    description: A StatWeights structure containing the updated weight values for
      various stats (e.g., Strength, Agility, Intellect).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update stat weights for a Warrior Frost spec
    code: 'StatWeights frostWarriorWeights;

      frostWarriorWeights.strength = 1.2f;

      frostWarriorWeights.agility = 0.8f;

      frostWarriorWeights.stamina = 1.0f;

      lootAnalysis->UpdateStatWeights(CLASS_WARRIOR, SPEC_WARRIOR_FROST, frostWarriorWeights);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update stat weights for a Mage Fire spec with custom values
    code: 'StatWeights fireMageWeights;

      fireMageWeights.intellect = 1.5f;

      fireMageWeights.spirit = 0.7f;

      fireMageWeights.mana = 2.0f;

      fireMageWeights.criticalStrike = 1.3f;

      lootAnalysis->UpdateStatWeights(CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_MAGE_FIRE, fireMageWeights);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the loot evaluation algorithm's decision-making
    process. Changes to stat weights will immediately influence how future loot items
    are scored and ranked for players of the specified class and specialization.
  warnings: Modifying stat weights can significantly alter gameplay balance and player
    experience. Ensure that weight values are carefully chosen to reflect actual game
    mechanics and intended playstyle optimizations.
