  class: BotDatabasePool
  method: CacheResult
  signature: void BotDatabasePool::CacheResult(const std::string & key, const int
    & result, int ttl)
documentation:
  brief: Caches a database result with a specified key and time-to-live value for
    use in bot-related operations.
  description: The CacheResult method stores a database query result in an internal
    cache using a provided key. This allows for faster retrieval of frequently accessed
    data without repeated database queries. The cached entry will expire after the
    specified time-to-live (ttl) period, ensuring that stale data is automatically
    removed. This functionality is particularly useful for caching bot configuration
    settings, player data, or other frequently accessed information in World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: key
    description: A unique string identifier used to store and retrieve the cached
      result. Should be descriptive and consistent for related data items.
  - name: result
    description: The integer value representing the database query result to be cached.
      This could represent a player ID, configuration flag, or other numeric data.
  - name: ttl
    description: Time-to-live value in seconds specifying how long the cached entry
      should remain valid before automatic expiration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cache Usage
    code: BotDatabasePool::instance().CacheResult("player_12345_config", 42, 3600);
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Bot Spawn Configuration
    code: 'int spawnRate = GetBotSpawnRate();

      BotDatabasePool::instance().CacheResult("bot_spawn_rate", spawnRate, 1800);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates within the TrinityCore's database connection pooling
    system. The cache is typically implemented using an in-memory data structure such
    as std::map or similar container for fast lookup. Thread safety should be considered
    when multiple threads access the same cache instance.
  warnings: Ensure that the ttl value is appropriate for your use case to avoid caching
    stale data or consuming unnecessary memory. Avoid using excessively long TTL values
    for data that changes frequently.
