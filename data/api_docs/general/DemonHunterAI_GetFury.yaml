documentation:
  brief: Returns the current fury amount of the Demon Hunter AI unit
  description: The GetFury method retrieves the current fury resource value for a
    Demon Hunter AI unit. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, fury
    is a resource system specific to Demon Hunters that governs their ability usage
    and special mechanics. This method provides access to the internal fury tracking
    state of the AI-controlled Demon Hunter, allowing other systems or scripts to
    query the current fury level without direct internal access. The returned value
    typically ranges from 0 to 100, representing the percentage of maximum fury available.
    This method is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to determine when
    abilities that consume fury should be executed.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the current fury amount of the Demon Hunter
    AI unit, typically ranging from 0 to 100 indicating the percentage of maximum
    fury available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check fury level
    code: "if (DemonHunterAI* ai = dynamic_cast<DemonHunterAI*>(unit->GetAI())) {\n\
      \    int fury = ai->GetFury();\n    if (fury >= 80) {\n        // Execute high\
      \ fury ability\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using fury value in AI decision making
    code: "void DemonHunterAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (GetFury() >= 50) {\n\
      \        // Use a fury-consuming ability\n        DoCastVictim(SPELL_FURY_ABILITY);\n\
      \    } else {\n        // Use a regular attack or low fury ability\n       \
      \ AttackStart(me->GetVictim());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Demon Hunter AI subsystem and should only be called
    on units that are properly initialized as Demon Hunter AIs. The returned value
    reflects the internal fury state which may be modified by various game mechanics
    including ability usage, passive effects, and external modifications. The method
    is marked as const, indicating it does not modify the object's state.
  warnings: Calling this method on non-Demon Hunter AI units may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect values. Ensure proper type checking before calling to avoid
    runtime errors. The fury value returned is a snapshot at the time of call and
    may change immediately after the method returns due to game mechanics.
