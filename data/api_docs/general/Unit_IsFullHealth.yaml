documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has full health points, returning true if the unit's current
    health equals its maximum health.
  description: The IsFullHealth method determines whether a Unit object has reached
    its maximum health point value. This is commonly used in game logic to check if
    a character or creature has fully recovered their health after taking damage or
    during combat scenarios. The method returns true when the unit's current health
    matches their maximum health, indicating no damage has been sustained or that
    healing has restored all health points. It is often used in conjunction with other
    health-related methods for comprehensive health status evaluation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's current health equals its maximum health; otherwise
    returns false. This indicates the unit has full health and no damage has been
    sustained.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsFullHealth())\n{\n    // Unit is at full health\n    // Proceed\
      \ with actions requiring full health\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically relies on internal health tracking mechanisms within
    TrinityCore. Performance considerations may arise when used frequently in loops
    or conditional statements, especially for large groups of units. Thread safety
    is generally not an issue as this method does not modify any state.
  warnings: This method should not be confused with methods that check for specific
    health percentages or thresholds. It only returns true when health exactly matches
    maximum health, which may not always be the case in dynamic combat scenarios where
    health can fluctuate rapidly.
