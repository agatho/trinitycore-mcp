documentation:
  brief: Sends a text message to a target player or creature using the specified text
    ID and message type.
  description: The Talk method allows a unit (NPC or player) to send a text message
    to a specific target within the game world. It utilizes a predefined text ID,
    message type, and optional range parameters to determine how the message is delivered.
    This method is commonly used in quest scripts or NPC dialogue systems to communicate
    with players. The message can be sent as a whisper, yell, or emote depending on
    the msgType parameter, and the textRange defines how far away the target must
    be for the message to be visible.
  parameters:
  - name: textId
    description: The unique identifier of the text entry to send. This corresponds
      to a specific text in the game's database that is used to determine what message
      is displayed.
  - name: msgType
    description: The type of message being sent, which determines how the text is
      delivered (whisper, yell, emote). Valid values include 0 (say), 1 ( yell), 2
      ( whisper), and 3 ( emote).
  - name: textRange
    description: The maximum distance in yards from the unit to the target where the
      message will be visible. If the target is further away, the message won't be
      displayed.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target player or creature that will receive the message.
      If null, the message is sent to all players within range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: Unit->Talk(12345, 0, 10.0f, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with target
    code: Unit->Talk(12345, 1, 5.0f, &player);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with database entries for text
    messages and should be used carefully to avoid sending unintended messages. The
    message type affects how the text appears in game, and the range parameter determines
    visibility of the message.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect text delivery or missing
    messages if parameters are not properly set. Ensure that textId corresponds to
    valid database entries otherwise the message will not be displayed.
