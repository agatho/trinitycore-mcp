  brief: Updates the voidform state and associated resource management for InsanityResource.
  description: The UpdateVoidform method is responsible for managing the internal
    state of the InsanityResource class, specifically handling updates to the voidform
    mechanic. This method processes time-based changes and resource adjustments that
    occur during the voidform state, ensuring proper synchronization of the player's
    insanity resource with the game's current state. It typically handles cooldowns,
    resource regeneration, and state transitions related to voidform abilities. The
    method is called periodically by the game loop to maintain accurate resource tracking
    and ensure proper behavior of voidform-related spells and effects.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::UpdateInsanityResources()\n{\n    for (auto& resource :\
      \ m_insanityResources)\n    {\n        resource->UpdateVoidform(diff);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during game updates to maintain accurate
    resource state. The implementation likely involves checking current time deltas
    and updating internal counters or flags related to voidform duration and cooldowns.
