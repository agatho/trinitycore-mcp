documentation:
  brief: Adds a pet aura to the player's pet.
  description: This method adds a specified pet aura to the player's currently active
    pet. The pet aura represents a spell effect that is applied to the pet, typically
    used for managing pet behavior such as summoning, buffing, or debuffing. It ensures
    that the pet receives the correct aura effects based on the provided spell information,
    allowing for proper pet management within the game mechanics. This method is crucial
    for maintaining pet functionality and ensuring that pets respond appropriately
    to various in-game events.
  parameters:
  - name: petSpell
    description: A pointer to a PetAura structure containing the spell information
      to be applied to the pet. This parameter defines the specific aura that will
      be added to the pet, including details such as spell ID, duration, and effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      PetAura* aura = new PetAura();

      player->AddPetAura(aura);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      PetAura* aura = new PetAura();

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with pet management systems
    and should be called when a pet needs to be updated with new aura effects. It's
    important to note that the method does not directly apply the aura to the pet
    itself, but rather ensures that the correct aura information is passed to the
    pet's internal system for processing.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may result in incorrect pet behavior or missing
    aura effects. Care should be taken when setting up the PetAura structure to ensure
    proper spell ID and duration values are provided.
