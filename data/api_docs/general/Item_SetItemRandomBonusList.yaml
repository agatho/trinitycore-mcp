  signature: void Item::SetItemRandomBonusList(ItemRandomBonusListId bonusListId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the random bonus list for an item to determine its random properties.
  description: This method assigns a specific random bonus list ID to an Item object,
    which controls the random properties and enchantments that can be applied to the
    item. The random bonus list determines the possible random stats and effects that
    may appear on the item. This method is typically used during item creation or
    modification processes to ensure proper randomization of item attributes. It affects
    how the item's random properties are generated, including stat bonuses, enchantment
    effects, and other game mechanics related to item quality and progression.
  parameters:
  - name: bonusListId
    description: The identifier of the random bonus list to be applied to the item.
      This ID determines which random properties can be generated for the item, including
      stat bonuses and enchantment effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Random Bonus List
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetItemRandomBonusList(1234);

      // This assigns the random bonus list with ID 1234 to the item'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Random Bonus List for Item Creation
    code: 'Item* item = new Item();

      item->SetItemRandomBonusList(5678);

      // This sets the random bonus list for a newly created item

      // The item will now have random properties based on bonus list 5678'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before item generation or modification to ensure
    that the random bonus list is properly applied. It is important to note that the
    bonusListId must correspond to a valid random bonus list in the game database,
    otherwise the item may not receive proper random properties.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to items with incorrect or no random
    properties. Care should be taken when setting the bonusListId to ensure it matches
    valid entries in the database. If the wrong bonus list ID is used, the item may
    not have any random properties applied.
