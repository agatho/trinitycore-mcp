  class: BotSessionFactory
  method: ApplyBaseConfiguration
  signature: void BotSessionFactory::ApplyBaseConfiguration(std::shared_ptr<BotSession>
    session, const int & request)
documentation:
  brief: Applies base configuration settings to a bot session.
  description: The ApplyBaseConfiguration method initializes and configures fundamental
    settings for a bot session, ensuring that the session is properly set up with
    default values and parameters required for bot operation within the TrinityCore
    environment. This method typically handles core session properties such as difficulty
    levels, behavior flags, and initial state configurations. It serves as a foundational
    step in the bot session lifecycle, preparing the session before more specific
    configurations or gameplay behaviors are applied.
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: A shared pointer to the BotSession object that will receive the base
      configuration settings.
  - name: request
    description: An integer reference representing a request identifier or configuration
      type that determines how the base configuration is applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ApplyBaseConfiguration
    code: 'std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = std::make_shared<BotSession>();

      int configRequest = 1;

      BotSessionFactory factory;

      factory.ApplyBaseConfiguration(session, configRequest);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot
    session. It's important to ensure that the session object is valid and properly
    allocated before calling this method. The 'request' parameter may influence which
    base configuration is applied, so developers should understand its meaning within
    the context of their specific implementation.
  warnings: Calling this method on an uninitialized or null session pointer will likely
    result in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all preconditions are met
    before invoking ApplyBaseConfiguration.
