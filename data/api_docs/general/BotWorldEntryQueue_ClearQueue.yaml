  brief: Clears all entries from the bot world entry queue
  description: The ClearQueue method removes all queued entries from the BotWorldEntryQueue,
    effectively resetting the queue to an empty state. This operation is typically
    used when cleaning up or resetting bot behavior queues, ensuring no pending world
    entries remain in memory. The method performs a complete flush of the internal
    queue structure without any parameters or return values. This functionality is
    essential for maintaining proper bot state management and preventing stale entries
    from interfering with new operations.

  - title: Basic Queue Clearing
    code: 'BotWorldEntryQueue queue;

      // ... add entries to queue ...

      queue.ClearQueue(); // Clears all entries'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs an immediate clear operation on the internal queue structure.
    It should be used carefully in multi-threaded environments where concurrent access
    to the queue might occur, as it may require synchronization mechanisms to prevent
    race conditions.
