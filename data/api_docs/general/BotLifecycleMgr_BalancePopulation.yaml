documentation:
  brief: Balances the population of AI-controlled bots across available player characters.
  description: The BalancePopulation method in BotLifecycleMgr is responsible for
    maintaining an optimal distribution of AI-controlled bots among active player
    characters. This method ensures that bot assignments are fairly distributed to
    prevent over-concentration on specific players or areas, which could lead to performance
    issues or gameplay imbalance. It typically runs periodically as part of the bot
    management system to dynamically adjust bot-to-player ratios based on current
    server load and player activity patterns.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: BotLifecycleMgr::instance()->BalancePopulation();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the TrinityCore bot system's
    lifecycle management. Developers should not typically call this directly unless
    implementing custom bot distribution logic. The balancing algorithm may consider
    factors such as player level, zone population, and server resource utilization.
