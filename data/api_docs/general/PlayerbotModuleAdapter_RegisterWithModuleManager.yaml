documentation:
  brief: Registers the player bot module adapter with the module manager to enable
    bot functionality.
  description: The RegisterWithModuleManager method integrates a PlayerbotModuleAdapter
    instance into the TrinityCore's module management system. This allows the module
    to be properly initialized, loaded, and managed by the player bot system. The
    method typically sets up internal references and registers the module with the
    global module manager singleton. It is usually called during the initialization
    phase of player bot modules to ensure proper integration with the game's bot framework.
    This registration process enables the module to receive events, manage bot behavior,
    and participate in the overall bot AI system.

  - title: Basic Module Registration
    code: "class MyPlayerbotModule : public PlayerbotModuleAdapter\n{\npublic:\n \
      \   void Initialize() override\n    {\n        // Register with module manager\n\
      \        RegisterWithModuleManager();\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ code\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called once during module initialization.
    The registration process is critical for proper module functionality and should
    not be skipped. It's recommended to call this method after all necessary setup
    is complete but before the module begins processing bot commands.
  warnings: Calling RegisterWithModuleManager multiple times on the same instance
    may lead to undefined behavior or duplicate registrations. Ensure that this method
    is only called once per module instance during initialization.
