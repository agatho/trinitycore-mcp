documentation:
  brief: Saves player actions to database with transaction support
  description: The _SaveActions method is responsible for persisting player action
    bar configurations and associated data to the database. This method handles the
    saving of action slots, cooldowns, and other action-related information that needs
    to be stored in the database. It typically uses a transaction parameter to ensure
    atomicity of the save operation, preventing data inconsistencies during database
    updates. The method is part of the player's internal save mechanism and is called
    when actions need to be persisted across sessions.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Transaction identifier used for database operations. This parameter
      controls the transaction context in which the action data is saved, ensuring
      that all related action data is committed together as a single unit.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveActions(0);

      // Saves actions with no transaction context'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->_SaveActions(1);

      // Saves actions with transaction context 1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during player logout or when action data
    needs to be persisted. It's important to note that the method may not actually
    save anything if no action data has changed since last save. The method uses transaction
    management to ensure database consistency and performance.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to database inconsistencies if transaction
    handling is not properly managed. This method should not be called outside of
    proper player save contexts, as it may cause unnecessary database overhead or
    data corruption.
