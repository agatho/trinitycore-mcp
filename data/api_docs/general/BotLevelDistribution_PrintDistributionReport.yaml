  method: PrintDistributionReport
  signature: void BotLevelDistribution::PrintDistributionReport() const
documentation:
  brief: Prints a detailed report of bot level distribution statistics to the console
    or log.
  description: The PrintDistributionReport method generates and outputs a comprehensive
    statistical breakdown of how bots are distributed across different level ranges
    within the game environment. This method is typically used for debugging, performance
    analysis, or administrative oversight of bot populations. It provides insights
    into the balance of low-level, mid-level, and high-level bots, which can be crucial
    for maintaining game economy stability and player experience quality. The output
    includes counts, percentages, and potentially average levels per distribution
    tier.

      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely accesses internal bot management structures and may have
    performance implications if called frequently during high-traffic periods. It
    is recommended to use this method primarily for diagnostic purposes rather than
    in performance-critical code paths.
