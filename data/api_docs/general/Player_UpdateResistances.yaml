  method: UpdateResistances
  signature: void Player::UpdateResistances(uint32 school)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's resistance values for the specified magic school.
  description: The UpdateResistances method recalculates and applies updated resistance
    values for a specific magical school to the player character. This method is typically
    invoked when a player's gear, buffs, or other modifiers that affect magical resistance
    change. It ensures that the player's current resistance stats are accurately reflected
    in their combat calculations. The method operates on a per-school basis, allowing
    for targeted updates without recalculating all resistances simultaneously. This
    functionality is integral to maintaining accurate spell resistance mechanics in
    World of Warcraft's combat system.
  parameters:
  - name: school
    description: 'The magical school identifier (0-6) for which resistances should
      be updated. Valid values are: 0=Physical, 1=Holy, 2=Fire, 3=Nature, 4=Frost,
      5=Shadow, 6=Arcane.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update Fire Resistance
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateResistances(SPELL_SCHOOL_FIRE);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update All Resistances
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i < MAX_SPELL_SCHOOL; ++i)\n\
      {\n    player->UpdateResistances(i);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method triggers a recalculation of the player's resistance stats and
    may cause visual updates in the client. It should only be called when resistance
    values have actually changed to avoid unnecessary processing. The method internally
    handles updating both base and total resistance values.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid school index (outside 0-6) may result
    in undefined behavior or incorrect resistance calculations. Always validate the
    school parameter before calling this method.
