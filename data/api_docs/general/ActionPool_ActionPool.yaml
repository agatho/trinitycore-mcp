documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new ActionPool instance with default settings and empty action
    storage.
  description: The ActionPool constructor initializes a new instance of the ActionPool
    class. This method sets up internal data structures required for managing game
    actions, typically used in AI systems or scripted behaviors within TrinityCore.
    It prepares the pool to store and manage various action types that can be executed
    by NPCs or players. The initialization ensures that all necessary memory is allocated
    and default values are set appropriately for subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new ActionPool instance
    code: 'ActionPool* pool = new ActionPool();

      // The pool is now ready to be used for storing and managing actions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not take any parameters, so it always initializes the
    ActionPool with default settings. Developers should ensure proper cleanup of ActionPool
    instances by calling the destructor when no longer needed.
