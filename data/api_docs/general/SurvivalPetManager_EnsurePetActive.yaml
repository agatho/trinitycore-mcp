  class: SurvivalPetManager
  method: EnsurePetActive
  signature: void SurvivalPetManager::EnsurePetActive(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that a survival pet is active and ready for use by the player.
  description: The EnsurePetActive method checks whether the player's survival pet
    is currently active and available for deployment. If the pet is not active, this
    method will attempt to activate it or prepare it for use. This functionality is
    typically used in scenarios where a player needs their pet to be ready immediately,
    such as during combat encounters or when entering specific zones. The method operates
    on a target parameter that may represent the intended pet or a related entity.
    It ensures proper synchronization between the game state and the pet's active
    status.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target or identifier of the
      pet to be activated. This value is used internally to determine which pet should
      be made active.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int petTarget = 12345;

      manager->EnsurePetActive(&petTarget);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Ready Pet Activation
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      int targetId = player->GetPet()->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      manager->EnsurePetActive(&targetId);

      // Pet is now ready for combat usage'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the pet exists and has been properly initialized.
    It may perform internal checks to validate the pet's readiness state before attempting
    activation. The target parameter should point to a valid identifier associated
    with a player's pet.
  warnings: Improper use of this method without verifying pet existence or validity
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the target pointer points to a valid
    pet identifier before calling this method.
