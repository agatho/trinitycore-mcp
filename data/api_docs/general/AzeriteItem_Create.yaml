  class: AzeriteItem
  method: Create
  signature: bool AzeriteItem::Create(int guidlow, int itemId, int context, const
    int * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and creates a new Azerite item instance with specified properties.
  description: The Create method is responsible for initializing a new AzeriteItem
    object with the provided unique identifier, item template ID, context, and owner
    information. This method sets up the internal state of the Azerite item, preparing
    it for use within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that all necessary data
    structures are properly allocated and configured before the item can be utilized
    in gameplay mechanics such as Azerite power progression or artifact traits. The
    method returns a boolean value indicating whether the creation process was successful
    or not.
  parameters:
  - name: guidlow
    description: The low part of the unique identifier (GUID) for this Azerite item.
      This value uniquely identifies the item within the game world and is typically
      derived from the database entry.
  - name: itemId
    description: The template ID of the Azerite item. This corresponds to the ItemTemplate
      entry in the database that defines the base properties, appearance, and behavior
      of the Azerite item.
  - name: context
    description: The context value associated with this Azerite item. This may represent
      various game states or conditions such as item level, quality, or special modifiers
      that affect how the Azerite item behaves in-game.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the GUID of the owner of this Azerite item. If null, the
      item is considered unowned or has no specific owner assigned at creation time.
  returns: True if the Azerite item was successfully created and initialized with
    the provided parameters; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Azerite Item Creation
    code: "AzeriteItem* azeriteItem = new AzeriteItem();\nbool success = azeriteItem->Create(12345,\
      \ 123456, 10, nullptr);\nif (success) {\n    // Item created successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Azerite item created with GUID: %d\\n\", 12345);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Failed to create item\n    printf(\"Failed to create Azerite item\\n\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Azerite Item with Owner
    code: "uint64 ownerGuid = 54321;\nAzeriteItem* azeriteItem = new AzeriteItem();\n\
      bool success = azeriteItem->Create(98765, 654321, 20, &ownerGuid);\nif (success)\
      \ {\n    // Item created successfully with owner\n    printf(\"Azerite item\
      \ created for owner GUID: %llu\\n\", ownerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during object initialization or when creating
    new Azerite items programmatically. It does not perform any database operations;
    it assumes that the underlying data has already been loaded from the database
    or is being constructed in memory. The context parameter may influence how Azerite
    powers are applied or displayed.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already initialized AzeriteItem instance may
    lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. Always ensure that the object is properly
    initialized before calling Create, and avoid reusing objects without proper cleanup.
