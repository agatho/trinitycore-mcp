  class: GroupEvent
  method: MemberLeft
  signature: GroupEvent GroupEvent::MemberLeft(int groupGuid, int memberGuid, uint32
    removeMethod)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a GroupEvent instance indicating a member has left a group
  description: The MemberLeft method constructs and returns a GroupEvent object that
    represents the event of a player leaving a group. This method is typically used
    within the TrinityCore framework to track and process group membership changes,
    particularly when a player voluntarily leaves a group, is kicked, or disbands
    the group. The returned GroupEvent can be used by the game's event handling system
    to update player states, notify other group members, and manage group resources
    accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group from which the member is
      leaving
  - name: memberGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who left the group
  - name: removeMethod
    description: Specifies how the member was removed from the group (e.g., 0 = left,
      1 = kicked, 2 = disbanded)
  returns: A GroupEvent object representing the event of a member leaving a group,
    containing all relevant information about the removal action
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage for player leaving a group
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::MemberLeft(12345, 67890, 0);

      // This creates an event indicating player with GUID 67890 left group with GUID
      12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling different removal methods
    code: 'GroupEvent kickedEvent = GroupEvent::MemberLeft(12345, 67890, 1);

      GroupEvent disbandedEvent = GroupEvent::MemberLeft(12345, 67890, 2);

      // These create events for different types of group member removal'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's group management system and should be
    called whenever a player's group membership changes. The removeMethod parameter
    allows the system to distinguish between different types of removals, which may
    affect how the game handles subsequent events or notifications.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupGuid and memberGuid parameters are valid GUIDs before
    calling this method. Invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    in the group management system.
