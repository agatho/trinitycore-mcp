  class: Player
  method: ResetGroupUpdateSequenceIfNeeded
  signature: void Player::ResetGroupUpdateSequenceIfNeeded(const Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the group update sequence for the player if needed.
  description: The ResetGroupUpdateSequenceIfNeeded method ensures that a player's
    group update sequence is properly reset when necessary. This typically occurs
    during group synchronization events, such as when a player joins or leaves a group,
    or when group member data needs to be refreshed. The method checks whether the
    current group update sequence requires resetting and performs the reset operation
    if needed. This helps maintain consistency in group-related data updates and prevents
    stale or outdated information from being sent to clients.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which the update sequence should
      be reset. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset group update sequence when joining a new group
    code: "void Player::OnGroupJoin(Group* group)\n{\n    // Perform group join logic\n\
      \    ResetGroupUpdateSequenceIfNeeded(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by TrinityCore's group management
    system. Developers should not need to call this method directly unless implementing
    custom group synchronization logic.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer may result in undefined
    behavior. Always ensure the group parameter is valid before calling this method.
