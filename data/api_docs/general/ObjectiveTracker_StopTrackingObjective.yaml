  class: ObjectiveTracker
  method: StopTrackingObjective
  signature: void ObjectiveTracker::StopTrackingObjective(Player * bot, uint32 questId,
    uint32 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Stops tracking a specific objective for the given player.
  description: The StopTrackingObjective method removes a specified quest objective
    from the player's objective tracker. This function is typically used when a quest
    objective is completed or when the player no longer wishes to track a particular
    objective. The method takes a player reference, a quest identifier, and an objective
    index to precisely identify which objective to stop tracking. It ensures that
    the objective is removed from the UI tracker without affecting other objectives
    or the overall quest state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object for whom the objective tracking should
      be stopped.
  - name: questId
    description: Unique identifier of the quest containing the objective to stop tracking.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: Index of the specific objective within the quest's objective list
      to stop tracking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Stop Tracking a Specific Objective
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Assume player is initialized

      uint32 questId = 12345;

      uint32 objectiveIndex = 0;

      ObjectiveTracker::StopTrackingObjective(player, questId, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player has an active objective tracker and that
    the specified quest and objective index are valid. It does not validate whether
    the objective is currently being tracked before attempting to stop it.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid questId or objectiveIndex may result
    in undefined behavior or UI inconsistencies. Ensure that the quest and objective
    exist before calling this function.
