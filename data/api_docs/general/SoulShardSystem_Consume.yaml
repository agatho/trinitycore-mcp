  method: Consume
  signature: bool SoulShardSystem::Consume(uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Consumes a specified number of soul shards from the player's inventory
  description: The Consume method reduces the number of soul shards available to a
    player by the specified amount. This method is typically used in conjunction with
    warlock abilities that require soul shards as resource consumption. The method
    checks if the player has sufficient soul shards before performing the deduction.
    If the requested amount exceeds the available shards, the operation will fail
    and return false without modifying the shard count.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified number of soul shards were successfully consumed,
    false otherwise. Returns false when there are insufficient soul shards available
    for consumption.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Soul Shard Consumption
    code: "if (soulShardSystem->Consume(1)) {\n    // Successfully consumed one soul\
      \ shard\n    // Proceed with warlock spell casting\n} else {\n    // Not enough\
      \ soul shards available\n    // Handle insufficient resources\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Consuming Multiple Soul Shards
    code: "uint32 requiredShards = 3;\nif (soulShardSystem->Consume(requiredShards))\
      \ {\n    // Successfully consumed 3 soul shards\n    // Cast a high-level warlock\
      \ spell\n} else {\n    // Insufficient soul shards for the spell\n    // Display\
      \ error message to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called before casting warlock spells that require
    soul shard resources. The implementation should be thread-safe as it may be called
    from different game systems simultaneously. Performance impact is minimal since
    it only involves integer comparisons and decrements.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking available shards first may lead to
    unexpected behavior if insufficient resources are present. Always verify the return
    value before proceeding with spell casting or other actions that depend on consumed
    resources.
