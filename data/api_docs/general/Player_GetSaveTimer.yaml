  class: Player
  method: GetSaveTimer
  signature: uint32 Player::GetSaveTimer() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in seconds until the player's data is automatically
    saved to the database.
  description: The GetSaveTimer method retrieves the number of seconds remaining before
    the player's character data will be automatically persisted to the database. This
    timer is managed internally by the TrinityCore server and is typically reset whenever
    the player performs actions that would trigger a save, such as logging out, changing
    zones, or modifying character state. The save timer helps balance performance
    with data integrity by preventing excessive database writes while ensuring that
    recent changes are not lost in case of server crashes. This method is commonly
    used in server-side logic to determine when it's safe to perform certain operations
    or to display status information to the player.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of seconds remaining until the next
    automatic save. Returns 0 if the player data is due for immediate saving or if
    no save timer is currently active.
  examples:
  - title: Check Save Timer Before Logout
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 secondsRemaining\
      \ = player->GetSaveTimer();\n    if (secondsRemaining > 0)\n    {\n        //\
      \ Notify player that data will be saved in X seconds\n        player->SendNotification(\"\
      Data will be saved in %u seconds.\", secondsRemaining);\n    }\n    else\n \
      \   {\n        // Data is due for immediate save\n        player->SaveToDB();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Implement Custom Save Logic
    code: "void CheckPlayerSaveStatus(Player* player)\n{\n    uint32 timer = player->GetSaveTimer();\n\
      \    if (timer <= 30) // Less than 30 seconds remaining\n    {\n        // Force\
      \ save to prevent data loss\n        player->SaveToDB();\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Forced save for player %s\", player->GetName().c_str());\n    }\n    else if\
      \ (timer > 60)\n    {\n        // Log long timer for debugging purposes\n  \
      \      sLog->outString(\"Player %s has %u seconds until next auto-save.\", player->GetName().c_str(),\
      \ timer);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The save timer is managed by the server's internal update loop and may vary
    based on server configuration settings. The actual save interval can be configured
    via the 'player.save_interval' setting in the worldserver.conf file. This method
    is thread-safe as it only reads from a member variable that is updated in a controlled
    manner.
  warnings: Do not rely on this timer for critical data operations, as it may return
    0 even when the player has recent unsaved changes. Always ensure proper error
    handling when using this value in time-sensitive operations.
