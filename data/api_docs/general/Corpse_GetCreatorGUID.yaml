  class: Corpse
  method: GetCreatorGUID
  signature: int Corpse::GetCreatorGUID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the player who created this corpse.
  description: The GetCreatorGUID method retrieves the Game Object ID (GUID) of the
    player who originally created the corpse. This is typically used in World of Warcraft's
    corpse system to track which player's body has been left behind after death. The
    returned value represents the full GUID of the player, including the low part
    and the high part that identifies the type of object. This method is commonly
    used for corpse-related queries such as determining ownership, enabling resurrection
    mechanics, or tracking player deaths in game events. It is important to note that
    this GUID refers specifically to the original creator of the corpse and not necessarily
    the current owner if the corpse has been looted or moved.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the full GUID of the player who created
    the corpse. This value uniquely identifies the player object in the game world
    and can be used to retrieve the associated Player object through the ObjectAccessor
    system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get creator GUID
    code: "Corpse* corpse = ...; // Assume corpse is initialized\nint creatorGuid\
      \ = corpse->GetCreatorGUID();\nif (creatorGuid != 0)\n{\n    // Use the GUID\
      \ to retrieve player object\n    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid(HighGuid::Player,\
      \ creatorGuid));\n    if (player)\n    {\n        // Process the player who\
      \ created this corpse\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Corpse class which represents a player's remains
    after death. The returned GUID value should be used carefully as it may not always
    correspond to a live player object if the player has logged out or the corpse
    has been destroyed. The method does not perform any validation on whether the
    creator still exists in the game world, so callers should verify the existence
    of the referenced object before using it.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID directly without verifying that
    the corresponding player object still exists. If a player has logged out or their
    session has ended, the GUID may no longer be valid for retrieving the actual Player
    object. Also, in some edge cases involving corpse looting or graveyard mechanics,
    the creator GUID might not always match the current owner of the corpse.
