  method: SendSocialList
  signature: void PlayerSocial::SendSocialList(Player * player, uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Sends the social list of a player to the specified target player.
  description: The SendSocialList method is responsible for transmitting a player's
    social list, which includes friends and ignored players, to another player's client.
    This functionality is part of the TrinityCore's social system that manages player
    relationships within the game world. The method takes a target player and a set
    of flags that determine which portions of the social list should be sent. It typically
    gets invoked when a player opens their social window or when the server needs
    to synchronize social data between players.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose social list will be sent to
      the target player. This represents the recipient of the social information.
  - name: flags
    description: A bitmask that specifies which parts of the social list should be
      included in the transmission. Common values may include flags for friends, ignored
      players, or both.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send full social list to a target player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      uint32 allFlags = SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND | SOCIAL_FLAG_IGNORED;

      playerSocial->SendSocialList(targetPlayer, allFlags);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Send only friend list to a player
    code: 'Player* targetPlayer = ...; // Assume this is initialized

      uint32 friendOnlyFlags = SOCIAL_FLAG_FRIEND;

      playerSocial->SendSocialList(targetPlayer, friendOnlyFlags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the network layer to send packets to
    clients. It should only be called when the target player is online and connected.
    The implementation may involve checking for valid player pointers and ensuring
    proper packet formatting before sending.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the target player is valid
    or connected could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Additionally, incorrect
    flag values might cause incomplete or malformed social data to be sent to clients.
