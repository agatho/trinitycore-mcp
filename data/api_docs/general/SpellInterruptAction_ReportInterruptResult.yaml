    & context, bool success, const std::string & reason)
documentation:
  brief: Reports the result of a spell interruption attempt to the AI system
  description: The ReportInterruptResult method is used by the SpellInterruptAction
    class to communicate the outcome of a spell interruption attempt back to the BotAI
    system. This method logs the success or failure of the interruption, along with
    an optional reason string that provides additional context about why the interruption
    succeeded or failed. The method is typically called after attempting to interrupt
    an enemy's spell cast, and it helps the AI make decisions about future actions
    based on the outcome of previous interruption attempts. It plays a crucial role
    in the bot's decision-making process when dealing with enemy spellcasters.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that initiated the spell interruption
      attempt. This parameter is required and must not be null.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to an InterruptContext object containing details about
      the spell interruption attempt, including target information and spell data.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the spell interruption was successful
      (true) or failed (false).
  - name: reason
    description: String providing additional context about why the interruption succeeded
      or failed. This may include error messages, timing issues, or other relevant
      information.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic spell interruption result reporting
    code: "void MySpellInterruptAction::HandleInterrupt()\n{\n    BotAI* ai = GetBotAI();\n\
      \    InterruptContext context;\n    // ... populate context ...\n    bool success\
      \ = false;\n    std::string reason = \"Target not in range\";\n    ReportInterruptResult(ai,\
      \ context, success, reason);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Successful spell interruption reporting
    code: "void SpellInterruptAction::OnSpellInterrupted()\n{\n    BotAI* ai = GetBotAI();\n\
      \    InterruptContext context = GetCurrentInterruptContext();\n    bool success\
      \ = true;\n    std::string reason = \"Interrupted successfully with 85% chance\"\
      ;\n    ReportInterruptResult(ai, context, success, reason);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the SpellInterruptAction class
    during spell interruption logic. The AI system uses these reports to adjust future
    behavior patterns and decision-making strategies when encountering similar situations.
