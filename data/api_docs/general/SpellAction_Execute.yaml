  class: SpellAction
  method: Execute
  signature: ActionResult SpellAction::Execute(BotAI * ai, const ActionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the spell action within the context of a bot AI, returning the result
    of the execution.
  description: The Execute method performs the core logic of a spell action within
    the TrinityCore bot AI framework. It takes an AI instance and action context as
    inputs to determine how the spell should be executed. This method is typically
    invoked by the AI decision-making system when a specific spell action has been
    selected for execution. The method returns an ActionResult that indicates whether
    the action was successful, failed, or requires further processing. The implementation
    may involve checking spell requirements, targeting logic, and handling cooldowns
    or resource costs.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance managing the execution context. This
      parameter provides access to the AI's state, target information, and other contextual
      data needed for spell execution.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to an ActionContext object containing parameters and state
      relevant to this specific action execution. Includes information such as target
      selection, spell parameters, and execution conditions.
  returns: ActionResult enum value indicating the outcome of the spell execution.
    Possible values include SUCCESS if the spell was cast successfully, FAILED if
    it could not be executed due to invalid conditions or requirements, or PENDING
    if the action requires additional processing or delay before completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Spell Execution
    code: "ActionResult result = spellAction.Execute(botAI, context);\nif (result\
      \ == ActionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Spell was cast successfully\n    botAI->GetAI()->SetNextAction(ActionType::ATTACK);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Execution Results
    code: "ActionResult result = spellAction.Execute(botAI, context);\nswitch (result)\
      \ {\n    case ActionResult::SUCCESS:\n        // Continue with next action\n\
      \        break;\n    case ActionResult::FAILED:\n        // Log failure and\
      \ try alternative action\n        botAI->GetAI()->SetNextAction(ActionType::MOVE_TO_TARGET);\n\
      \        break;\n    case ActionResult::PENDING:\n        // Wait for next tick\
      \ to re-evaluate\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI action execution pipeline and should only be
    called when the spell action is deemed appropriate based on current conditions.
    The context parameter must contain valid target information and spell parameters
    for successful execution. Implementation may involve complex targeting logic,
    spell validation, and resource management.
  warnings: Do not call this method without ensuring that the spell requirements are
    met or that the AI has proper context available. Calling with invalid parameters
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes in the AI system.
