  brief: Generates a social response message based on the current strategy and input
    message context
  description: The GenerateResponse method is responsible for creating appropriate
    social replies within the TrinityCore AI framework. It takes an incoming message
    string and processes it through the social strategy logic to produce a contextual,
    relevant reply. This method is typically used in NPC dialogue systems where automated
    responses need to be generated based on player interactions. The implementation
    likely considers factors such as relationship status, conversation history, and
    social context to determine the most appropriate response format and content.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a std::string containing the generated social response message
    that can be sent to the player or used in further dialogue processing. The returned
    string may be empty if no appropriate response could be generated based on the
    current strategy parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Social Response Generation
    code: 'SocialStrategy strategy;

      std::string input = "Hello there!";

      std::string response = strategy.GenerateResponse(input);

      // response might contain something like "Greetings, traveler!"'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI system that manages NPC social
    behavior. The actual implementation details depend on the specific social strategy
    being used (friendly, hostile, neutral, etc.). The method may cache or store internal
    state that affects response generation across multiple calls.
  warnings: The method signature indicates it's const, meaning it should not modify
    the object state. However, if internal caching is used, this might not be strictly
    enforced. Be cautious when using this in multithreaded environments where concurrent
    access to shared strategy data could cause issues.
