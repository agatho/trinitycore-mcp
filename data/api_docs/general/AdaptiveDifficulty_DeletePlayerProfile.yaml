documentation:
  brief: Deletes a player's adaptive difficulty profile from the database.
  description: The DeletePlayerProfile method removes a player's adaptive difficulty
    configuration data from the TrinityCore database. This function is typically invoked
    when a player character is deleted or when their adaptive difficulty settings
    need to be reset. The method takes a unique identifier (GUID) for the player and
    performs a database operation to remove all associated profile records. It ensures
    that no stale or outdated adaptive difficulty data remains in the system after
    a player's account or character is removed.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose adaptive difficulty
      profile should be deleted. This value corresponds to the player's database record
      identifier.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a Player's Adaptive Difficulty Profile
    code: AdaptiveDifficulty::DeletePlayerProfile(12345);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly interacts with the database and should be called only
    when appropriate, such as during player deletion or profile reset operations.
    Ensure that the GUID provided corresponds to an existing player record to avoid
    unnecessary database operations.
