documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads healing action definitions for bot AI behavior.
  description: The LoadHealingActions method is responsible for setting up the healing
    action framework within the BotAIInitializer class. This method configures the
    available healing abilities, their priorities, and conditions under which they
    should be executed by bot characters in World of Warcraft. It typically populates
    internal data structures with healing spell information, cooldown management,
    and targeting logic necessary for bots to perform effective healing in various
    combat scenarios. The method is part of the broader AI initialization process
    and ensures that healing-capable bots have access to appropriate healing actions
    based on their class, level, and role within the group.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Initialization
    code: 'BotAIInitializer initializer;

      initializer.LoadHealingActions();

      // Healing actions are now available for use by bot AI'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of a bot's
    AI system. It may be invoked automatically by the core bot management system or
    manually during custom AI setup. The method assumes that the bot's class and level
    data are already properly configured, as healing actions are class-specific.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper bot context or before initializing
    the bot's class information may result in incomplete or incorrect healing action
    definitions. Ensure all prerequisite data is loaded before invoking this method.
