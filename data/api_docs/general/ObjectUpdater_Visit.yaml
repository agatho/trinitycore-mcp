  method: Visit
  signature: void ObjectUpdater::Visit(int & param0)
documentation:
  brief: Updates object references in the world based on provided parameter
  description: The Visit method of ObjectUpdater is responsible for processing and
    updating object references within the game world. This method typically handles
    the traversal or iteration over objects that need to be refreshed, synchronized,
    or updated in the current game state. It's commonly used in the context of object
    management systems where periodic updates are required for entities such as players,
    creatures, items, or game objects. The method operates on a reference parameter
    that likely contains information about which objects or aspects of the world should
    be processed during this update cycle.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Reference parameter containing update context or object identifier
      information. This integer value typically represents a bitmask, object type
      identifier, or update flag that determines how the object update process should
      be handled.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Object Update
    code: 'ObjectUpdater updater;

      int updateFlag = 1;

      updater.Visit(updateFlag);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update with Multiple Flags
    code: 'ObjectUpdater updater;

      int updateFlags = 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x04; // Player, Creature, GameObject updates

      updater.Visit(updateFlags);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the game's main update loop and should
    be used carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks. The parameter value may influence
    which objects are processed and how they're updated, making it important to understand
    the flag meanings in context of the specific implementation.
  warnings: Improper use of the parameter value could result in incorrect object updates
    or missed updates. Ensure that the integer parameter contains valid update flags
    or identifiers as expected by the ObjectUpdater implementation.
