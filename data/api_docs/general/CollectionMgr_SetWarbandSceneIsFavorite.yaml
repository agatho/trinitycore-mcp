  signature: void CollectionMgr::SetWarbandSceneIsFavorite(uint32 warbandSceneId,
    bool apply)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether a specified warband scene is marked as favorite for the player.
  description: The SetWarbandSceneIsFavorite method updates the favorite status of
    a specific warband scene for the player. This functionality allows players to
    mark certain warband scenes as favorites, which may affect how they are displayed
    or prioritized in the UI. The method takes a warband scene identifier and a boolean
    flag indicating whether to apply or remove the favorite status. This operation
    typically involves updating internal player data structures and potentially synchronizing
    changes with the client.
  parameters:
  - name: warbandSceneId
    description: The unique identifier of the warband scene to modify. This ID corresponds
      to a specific scene in the game's warband system.
  - name: apply
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to apply (true) or remove (false)
      the favorite status for the specified warband scene.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Mark a Warband Scene as Favorite
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->SetWarbandSceneIsFavorite(12345, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Favorite Status from a Warband Scene
    code: 'CollectionMgr* collectionMgr = player->GetCollectionMgr();

      collectionMgr->SetWarbandSceneIsFavorite(67890, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal updates to the player's collection data
    and may send UI updates to the client. It is expected to be called within a valid
    player context where CollectionMgr is accessible.
