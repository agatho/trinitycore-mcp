  signature: void InstanceEventBus::UnsubscribeCallback(uint32 subscriptionId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a previously subscribed callback from the instance event bus using
    its unique subscription ID.
  description: The UnsubscribeCallback method removes a callback function that was
    previously registered with the InstanceEventBus using SubscribeCallback. This
    method takes a subscription ID as input and unregisters the corresponding callback,
    preventing it from being invoked when events occur within the instance. The subscription
    ID is typically obtained when calling SubscribeCallback and should be stored by
    the caller to later unsubscribe. If an invalid or non-existent subscription ID
    is provided, the method may silently ignore the request or throw an exception
    depending on implementation details. This mechanism allows for dynamic management
    of event handlers during runtime, which is essential for managing temporary or
    conditional event processing in World of Warcraft instances.
  parameters:
  - name: subscriptionId
    description: The unique identifier returned by SubscribeCallback when the callback
      was registered. This ID is used to identify and remove the specific callback
      subscription from the event bus.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Unsubscribe Usage
    code: 'uint32 subscriptionId = instanceEventBus.SubscribeCallback(callbackFunction);

      // ... some processing ...

      instanceEventBus.UnsubscribeCallback(subscriptionId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Unsubscribing in Event Handler Context
    code: "void MyEventHandler(uint32 eventId, uint32 data) {\n    // Unsubscribe\
      \ this handler after one use\n    instanceEventBus.UnsubscribeCallback(subscriptionId);\n\
      }\nuint32 subscriptionId = instanceEventBus.SubscribeCallback(MyEventHandler);"
    language: cpp
  notes: The InstanceEventBus is designed to handle multiple subscribers for the same
    event type. When unsubscribing, only the specific callback associated with the
    provided subscription ID will be removed. The method should be thread-safe if
    used in a multi-threaded environment, though this depends on the implementation
    details of the underlying event bus system.
  warnings: Attempting to unsubscribe using an invalid or already-used subscription
    ID may result in undefined behavior or silently fail. Always ensure that subscription
    IDs are properly tracked and not reused after unsubscribing. Failing to unsubscribe
    can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior if callbacks continue to be invoked
    after they should have been removed.
