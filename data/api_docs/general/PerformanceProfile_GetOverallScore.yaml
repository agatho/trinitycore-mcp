  method: GetOverallScore
  signature: float PerformanceProfile::GetOverallScore() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall performance score for the profile
  description: The GetOverallScore method computes a normalized performance metric
    based on various system and server performance indicators captured within the
    PerformanceProfile instance. This score typically represents a composite value
    that reflects the overall health, responsiveness, and efficiency of the game server
    or specific subsystem being profiled. The calculation may take into account factors
    such as frame rate stability, resource utilization, latency metrics, and other
    relevant performance data points collected during profiling periods. The returned
    value is generally expressed as a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0, where
    higher values indicate better performance. This method is commonly used for automated
    monitoring, performance benchmarking, and diagnostic reporting within TrinityCore's
    performance analysis framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the overall performance score, typically ranging
    from 0.0 (worst performance) to 1.0 (best performance). The exact scale and interpretation
    may vary based on internal weighting algorithms used by the profiling system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      float score = profile.GetOverallScore();

      printf("Server performance score: %.2f\n", score);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Monitoring
    code: "void MonitorServerPerformance() {\n    PerformanceProfile profile = GetLatestPerformanceProfile();\n\
      \    float overallScore = profile.GetOverallScore();\n    \n    if (overallScore\
      \ < 0.5f) {\n        LOG_ERROR(\"performance\", \"Critical performance degradation\
      \ detected: %.2f\", overallScore);\n    } else if (overallScore < 0.8f) {\n\
      \        LOG_WARNING(\"performance\", \"Performance below threshold: %.2f\"\
      , overallScore);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations that may involve multiple internal metrics
    and weighted averages. The implementation likely caches computed results to avoid
    repeated expensive computations during frequent calls. The score calculation might
    be influenced by recent profiling data, so calling this method immediately after
    different profiling sessions may yield varying results.
  warnings: The performance score is a composite metric and should not be used in
    isolation for critical decisions. It's recommended to also examine individual
    component metrics when diagnosing performance issues. The method returns a cached
    value if available, which might not reflect real-time conditions if the profile
    has not been recently updated.
