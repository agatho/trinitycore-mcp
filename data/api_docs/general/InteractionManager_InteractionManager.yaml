documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new InteractionManager instance with default settings and internal
    state.
  description: The InteractionManager constructor initializes a new instance of the
    InteractionManager class. This method sets up the internal data structures and
    default configurations required for managing player interactions within the TrinityCore
    framework. It prepares the manager to handle various interaction events such as
    quest acceptances, gossip selections, and object interactions. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary resources are allocated and initialized before the
    manager can be used to process interaction requests.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InteractionManager instance
    code: 'InteractionManager* manager = new InteractionManager();

      // The manager is now ready to handle interactions'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called internally by the core framework when
    initializing player interaction systems. Developers should not directly instantiate
    this class unless implementing custom interaction handling logic.
