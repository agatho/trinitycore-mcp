  class: PathGenerator
  method: SetUseRaycast
  signature: void PathGenerator::SetUseRaycast(bool useRaycast)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether raycasting is used for path generation in the PathGenerator.
  description: The SetUseRaycast method enables or disables the use of raycasting
    during pathfinding operations within the PathGenerator class. When enabled, the
    pathfinder will utilize raycasting to detect collisions and ensure that generated
    paths are valid and traversable. This feature is particularly important for maintaining
    accurate navigation in complex environments where obstacles must be properly accounted
    for. The setting affects subsequent path generation calls and can influence both
    performance and path accuracy depending on the game world's complexity.
  parameters:
  - name: useRaycast
    description: A boolean value indicating whether raycasting should be used during
      path generation. True enables raycasting, while false disables it.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Raycasting for Path Generation
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetUseRaycast(true);

      // Subsequent path generation will use raycasting for collision detection'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Raycasting for Performance Optimization
    code: 'PathGenerator pathGen;

      pathGen.SetUseRaycast(false);

      // Path generation will be faster but may not account for all obstacles'
    language: cpp
  notes: Enabling raycasting can significantly impact performance, especially in densely
    populated areas with many obstacles. It is recommended to disable raycasting in
    scenarios where performance is critical and the environment is relatively simple.
  warnings: Disabling raycasting may result in invalid paths that pass through solid
    objects, potentially causing NPCs or players to get stuck or move through walls.
    Always test thoroughly when modifying this setting.
