  class: CooldownCalculator
  method: CacheSpellData
  signature: void CooldownCalculator::CacheSpellData(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Caches spell data for cooldown calculations within the CooldownCalculator
    class.
  description: The CacheSpellData method retrieves and stores relevant spell information
    for a given spell ID, preparing it for subsequent cooldown calculations. This
    method is typically invoked when initializing or updating spell cooldown tracking
    for players or game entities. It ensures that necessary spell properties such
    as base cooldown duration, category, and other relevant attributes are readily
    available in memory for efficient lookup during gameplay. The caching mechanism
    helps optimize performance by avoiding repeated database or configuration lookups
    during active cooldown processing.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cached. Must correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'CooldownCalculator calculator;

      calculator.CacheSpellData(12345); // Cache data for spell with ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Multiple Spells
    code: "CooldownCalculator calculator;\nstd::vector<uint32> spellIds = {12345,\
      \ 67890, 54321};\nfor (uint32 id : spellIds) {\n    calculator.CacheSpellData(id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called during initialization or when spell
    data needs to be refreshed. It assumes that the provided spell ID exists in the
    game's database and will not handle invalid IDs gracefully. The caching behavior
    may vary depending on the underlying implementation, but typically involves storing
    spell properties in an internal map or similar structure for fast access.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spell ID may lead
    to undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that all spell IDs passed to this
    method are validated against the game's spell database before invocation.
