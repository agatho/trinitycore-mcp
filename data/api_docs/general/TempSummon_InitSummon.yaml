  class: TempSummon
  method: InitSummon
  signature: void TempSummon::InitSummon(int * summoner)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a temporary summon with the provided summoner reference.
  description: The InitSummon method sets up a temporary summon by associating it
    with a summoner object. This method is typically called during the creation or
    activation of a temporary summoned creature, such as a pet or minion. It establishes
    the relationship between the summon and its summoner, which is essential for proper
    behavior, AI handling, and cleanup. The method ensures that the summon inherits
    relevant properties from the summoner and is correctly registered within the game
    world's summoning system.
  parameters:
  - name: summoner
    description: Pointer to the summoner object that will be associated with this
      temporary summon. This parameter is crucial for establishing the summoner-summon
      relationship, which affects AI behavior, combat logic, and cleanup procedures.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Summon Initialization
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      TempSummon* summon = ...;

      summon->InitSummon(&player);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Pet Summon
    code: 'Creature* pet = ...;

      Unit* owner = ...;

      pet->ToTempSummon()->InitSummon(&owner);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the summon's lifetime, typically
    during its construction or activation. It is important to ensure that the summoner
    pointer remains valid for the duration of the summon's existence to prevent dangling
    pointer issues.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer as the summoner parameter may lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the summoner object exists and is in
    a valid state before calling InitSummon.
