  signature: const int * ObjectMgr::GetInstanceSpawnGroupsForMap(uint32 mapId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spawn groups associated with a specific map ID.
  description: The GetInstanceSpawnGroupsForMap method returns a constant pointer
    to an array of integers representing the spawn group identifiers for the specified
    map. This functionality is used in TrinityCore's instance management system to
    determine which spawn groups should be active for a given map or instance. The
    returned array is managed internally by the ObjectMgr class and should not be
    modified by callers. The method performs no validation on the input mapId, so
    invalid IDs may result in undefined behavior or empty arrays.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an array of integers representing spawn group identifiers
    for the specified map. Returns nullptr if no spawn groups are defined for the
    map.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Spawn Groups for a Map
    code: "const int* spawnGroups = sObjectMgr->GetInstanceSpawnGroupsForMap(1234);\n\
      if (spawnGroups != nullptr)\n{\n    // Process spawn groups\n    for (int i\
      \ = 0; spawnGroups[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Spawn Group ID: %d\\\
      n\", spawnGroups[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned array is null-terminated and managed internally by ObjectMgr.
    Callers should not attempt to free or modify the memory pointed to by the returned
    pointer. The method may return nullptr for maps that do not have any associated
    spawn groups defined in the database.
  warnings: This method returns a raw pointer to internal data structures. Do not
    store this pointer beyond the scope of the current function call, as the underlying
    data might be invalidated or reallocated. Accessing memory beyond the null-terminated
    array boundary results in undefined behavior.
