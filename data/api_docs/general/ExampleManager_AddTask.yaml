  class: ExampleManager
  method: AddTask
  signature: bool ExampleManager::AddTask(const Task & task)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a new task to the manager's task queue and returns true on success.
  description: The AddTask method is responsible for incorporating a new Task object
    into the ExampleManager's internal task processing system. It validates the provided
    task before adding it to an internal queue or list, ensuring that only valid tasks
    are processed. The method returns true if the task was successfully added to the
    manager's collection, and false if the addition failed due to validation errors
    or system limitations. This method is typically used in conjunction with other
    task management operations such as task execution, cancellation, or status checking.
  parameters:
  - name: task
    description: The Task object to be added to the manager's collection. The task
      must be properly initialized and contain valid data for processing. This parameter
      is required and cannot be null or invalid.
  returns: True if the task was successfully added to the manager's internal collection,
    false otherwise. Returns false if the task fails validation checks, if the manager's
    capacity is exceeded, or if an internal error occurs during addition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Task Addition
    code: "ExampleManager manager;\nTask myTask;\n// Initialize task with valid data\n\
      bool result = manager.AddTask(myTask);\nif (result) {\n    // Task was added\
      \ successfully\n    printf(\"Task added successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n    //\
      \ Failed to add task\n    printf(\"Failed to add task\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Tasks
    code: "ExampleManager manager;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n    Task task;\n\
      \    // Initialize each task with unique data\n    bool success = manager.AddTask(task);\n\
      \    if (!success) {\n        printf(\"Failed to add task %d\\n\", i);\n   \
      \ }\n}\n// Process all tasks in the manager"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe when used with proper synchronization mechanisms.
    The internal task queue may have a maximum capacity, which could cause AddTask
    to return false if the limit is reached. It's recommended to check the return
    value and handle failure cases appropriately in production code.
  warnings: Do not pass uninitialized or invalid Task objects to this method as it
    may lead to undefined behavior or failed additions. Ensure that all required fields
    of the Task object are properly set before calling AddTask.
