  signature: bool Spell::CheckSpellCancelsConfuse(int32 * param1) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spell cancels confusion effects.
  description: This method determines whether the current spell has the ability to
    cancel confusion status effects. It evaluates the spell's properties and effects
    to ascertain if it can remove the confusion state from targets. The method is
    typically used in spell handling logic to prevent confusion effects from being
    applied or maintained during specific spell interactions. This functionality is
    crucial for maintaining game balance and preventing exploits related to confusion
    mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the spell successfully cancels confusion effects, false
    otherwise. The method may return false if the spell does not have the appropriate
    effect or if the confusion state cannot be removed by this particular spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (spell->CheckSpellCancelsConfuse(nullptr)) {\n    // Handle confusion\
      \ cancellation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details are typically handled within the spell's effect system.
    This method may be used in conjunction with other spell cancellation methods to
    ensure proper handling of status effects. Performance considerations include checking
    for specific spell IDs and effect types.
  warnings: This method should only be called when dealing with confusion-related
    spells, as it may cause unexpected behavior if used with non-confusion spells.
    Avoid calling this method on spells that do not have confusion cancellation effects.
