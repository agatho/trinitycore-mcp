documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldown tracking for Death Knight abilities.
  description: The InitializeDeathKnightCooldowns method sets up internal data structures
    and state management for tracking cooldowns specific to Death Knight class abilities.
    This method is typically called during player initialization or when switching
    to the Death Knight specialization. It establishes baseline cooldown timers, prepares
    ability queues, and ensures proper synchronization of death knight abilities with
    the game's cooldown system. The method initializes all relevant cooldowns including
    major abilities like Death Strike, Blood Boil, Howling Blast, and other class-specific
    spells that have cooldown mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'CooldownStackingOptimizer optimizer;

      optimizer.InitializeDeathKnightCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per player session or when the Death
    Knight specialization is first activated. It performs no direct game state changes
    but prepares internal tracking structures that will be used by other cooldown-related
    methods. The initialization process may involve reading from configuration files
    or database entries to determine default cooldown values.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    inconsistent cooldown states. Ensure that all previous cooldown data is properly
    reset before calling this method again.
