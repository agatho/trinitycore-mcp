  class: BotAI
  method: RemoveStrategy
  signature: void BotAI::RemoveStrategy(const std::string & name)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified strategy from the bot's AI behavior configuration.
  description: The RemoveStrategy method removes a named strategy from the BotAI instance,
    effectively disabling that strategy's influence on the bot's decision-making process.
    This method is typically used during runtime to dynamically modify a bot's behavior
    by removing specific strategies that may be conflicting or no longer desired.
    The strategy name must match exactly with the one previously added using AddStrategy.
    If the specified strategy does not exist, the method will silently ignore the
    request without throwing an error. This allows for flexible and dynamic AI behavior
    modification during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: The exact string name of the strategy to be removed from the bot's
      AI configuration. This must match the strategy name as it was originally added
      using AddStrategy.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Combat Strategy
    code: 'BotAI* botAI = ...; // Get reference to bot AI

      botAI->RemoveStrategy("combat"); // Remove the combat strategy'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Strategy Removal
    code: "BotAI* botAI = ...;\nif (botAI->HasStrategy(\"healing\")) {\n    botAI->RemoveStrategy(\"\
      healing\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the bot's strategy stack and does not affect other
    AI components. It is safe to call multiple times with the same strategy name,
    though subsequent calls will have no effect after the first removal. The method
    performs a linear search through the active strategies, so performance may degrade
    slightly with many active strategies.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent strategy name will
    not produce any error or warning messages. It is recommended to verify strategy
    existence using HasStrategy before attempting removal to avoid silent failures.
