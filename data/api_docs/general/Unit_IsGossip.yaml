documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the unit has gossip options available for interaction.
  description: The IsGossip method checks if a Unit object (such as a player or NPC)
    has any gossip options that can be displayed to the user. This method is commonly
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's gossip system, where NPCs and players
    can have various dialogue options based on their quest status, faction relationships,
    or other game mechanics. It returns true if the unit possesses gossip options,
    false otherwise. The method is typically used in conjunction with other gossip-related
    functions to determine what actions should be taken when a player interacts with
    an NPC.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has gossip options available for interaction,
    false otherwise. This indicates that the unit can engage in a gossip conversation
    with the player, typically involving dialogue options or quest information.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Gossip Check
    code: "if (unit->IsGossip())\n{\n    // Unit has gossip options\n    // Proceed\
      \ to display gossip menu\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the standard TrinityCore API and is typically used
    in conjunction with other gossip-related methods like GetGossipMenu or GossipHello.
    It's important to note that this method does not check if a unit has active gossip
    options, but rather whether the unit has any gossip options at all.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully when checking for gossip options
    as it may not always reflect the current state of the unit's gossip menu. For
    example, a unit might have gossip options available but not necessarily have them
    displayed to the player at that moment.
