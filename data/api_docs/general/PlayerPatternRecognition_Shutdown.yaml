  signature: void PlayerPatternRecognition::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the player pattern recognition system, cleaning up resources and
    stopping active recognition processes.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates all ongoing pattern recognition activities
    for a player within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that any active
    recognition threads or timers are properly stopped, resources are released, and
    internal state is reset to a clean condition. It is typically invoked when a player
    logs out, changes zones, or when the system needs to be temporarily disabled.
    The shutdown process is designed to be thread-safe and should not leave any dangling
    references or active processes that could cause memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: "PlayerPatternRecognition* patternRecog = player->GetPatternRecognition();\n\
      if (patternRecog)\n{\n    patternRecog->Shutdown();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is no longer actively using
    pattern recognition features. Calling Shutdown multiple times on the same instance
    may result in undefined behavior or redundant cleanup operations.
