documentation:
  brief: Destroys the ScopedMLOperation object and cleans up any associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the ScopedMLOperation class is responsible for releasing
    any resources that were acquired during the lifetime of the object. This typically
    includes cleaning up memory allocations, unlocking mutexes, or performing other
    necessary cleanup operations to ensure no resource leaks occur. The method is
    automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    In the context of TrinityCore's multithreaded environment, this destructor may
    also handle releasing locks or synchronization primitives that were held during
    the operation.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void someFunction() {\n    ScopedMLOperation operation;\n    // Perform\
      \ operations with the scoped lock\n    // When function ends, destructor is\
      \ automatically called\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should be noexcept to prevent exceptions from being thrown
    during stack unwinding. It's important that this destructor properly releases
    any held locks or resources to avoid deadlocks or resource leaks in a multithreaded
    environment.
