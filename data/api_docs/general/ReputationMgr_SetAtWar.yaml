documentation:
  brief: Sets the reputation status of a faction to at war or not at war.
  description: The SetAtWar method modifies the at-war status of a specific faction
    within the player's reputation manager. When a faction is marked as at war, the
    player will receive increased reputation gain from killing creatures of that faction
    and may trigger certain quest events or achievements related to hostility. This
    method directly affects the internal state of the ReputationMgr and can influence
    various gameplay mechanics such as quest progression, vendor interactions, and
    combat behavior. The change takes effect immediately in the current session and
    persists through the player's session until modified again.
  parameters:
  - name: repListID
    description: The identifier of the faction reputation list to modify. This corresponds
      to a specific faction entry in the game's reputation system, typically defined
      by the faction's ID or index within the reputation manager.
  - name: 'on'
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether to set the faction as at war (true)
      or not at war (false). When true, the faction becomes hostile; when false, it
      returns to a neutral or friendly state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set a faction to at war
    code: 'ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();

      repMgr->SetAtWar(1234, true); // Set faction with ID 1234 to at war'
    language: cpp
  - title: Toggle at-war status for multiple factions
    code: "ReputationMgr* repMgr = player->GetReputationMgr();\nstd::vector<uint32>\
      \ factionIDs = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : factionIDs)\n{\n    repMgr->SetAtWar(id,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the player's local reputation data and does not directly
    communicate with the database unless explicitly saved. The at-war status affects
    how the game calculates reputation gains from kills and quest completion, but
    does not alter the faction's base standing or any permanent changes to the faction's
    relationship with the player.
  warnings: Modifying the at-war status of factions can have unintended consequences
    on quest progression or NPC interactions if not carefully managed. Be cautious
    when setting factions to war as it may affect access to certain quests, vendors,
    or areas that require neutral or friendly standing.
