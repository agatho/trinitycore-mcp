  class: BotTalentManager
  method: ApplyTalentLoadout
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::ApplyTalentLoadout(Player * bot, uint8 specId,
    uint32 level)
documentation:
  brief: Applies a specified talent loadout to a bot player for the given specialization
    and level.
  description: The ApplyTalentLoadout method configures a bot player's talents according
    to a predefined loadout associated with a specific talent specialization and character
    level. This function is typically used in automated bot behavior systems to ensure
    that bots have appropriate talent builds for their role or strategy. The method
    ensures that the bot's talent points are correctly allocated based on the provided
    specId and level, potentially resetting existing talents before applying the new
    loadout. It requires a valid player object representing the bot, a valid specialization
    ID, and a character level to determine the correct talent configuration.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose talents will
      be modified. Must not be null and must represent a valid bot instance.
  - name: specId
    description: The ID of the talent specialization to apply. Valid values correspond
      to the player's available specializations (e.g., 0 for first spec, 1 for second
      spec).
  - name: level
    description: The character level used to determine which talents should be learned
      and at what point in the talent tree they should be applied.
  returns: Returns true if the talent loadout was successfully applied to the bot,
    or false if an error occurred during the application process. Possible errors
    include invalid parameters, missing talent data, or failure to allocate talent
    points.
  examples:
  - title: Apply Talent Loadout for First Spec at Level 60
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume valid bot player\nbool success = BotTalentManager::ApplyTalentLoadout(myBot,\
      \ 0, 60);\nif (success)\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Talent loadout applied successfully\
      \ to bot.\");\nelse\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Failed to apply talent loadout\
      \ to bot.\");"
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Talent Loadout for Second Spec at Level 70
    code: "Player* bot = sObjectAccessor->FindPlayer(botGuid);\nif (bot && BotTalentManager::ApplyTalentLoadout(bot,\
      \ 1, 70))\n{\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot %s updated with second spec talents\
      \ at level 70.\", bot->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      bot\", \"Failed to update bot %s with second spec talents.\", bot ? bot->GetName().c_str()\
      \ : \"unknown\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has already been initialized and has valid
    talent data available for the specified level and specialization. It may reset
    existing talent points before applying new ones, so it should not be used in situations
    where manual talent management is required. The implementation relies on internal
    talent tree data structures and may require synchronization with the game's talent
    system.
  warnings: Using this method on a non-bot player or without proper initialization
    can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot player object
    is valid and fully initialized before calling this function. Also, note that applying
    talents at levels higher than the bot's current level may result in incomplete
    or incorrect talent point allocation.
