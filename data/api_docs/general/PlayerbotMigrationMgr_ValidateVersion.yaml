  method: ValidateVersion
  signature: bool PlayerbotMigrationMgr::ValidateVersion(const std::string & expectedVersion)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if the provided version string matches the expected version for
    player bot migration.
  description: The ValidateVersion method checks whether a given version string conforms
    to the expected version format required for player bot migration operations within
    TrinityCore. This method is typically used during initialization or configuration
    phases to ensure compatibility between the current player bot system and the expected
    migration target. It performs a comparison against an internal expected version,
    returning true if they match exactly, or false otherwise. The validation may involve
    checking semantic versioning formats or specific build identifiers depending on
    implementation details.
  parameters:
  - name: expectedVersion
    description: A string representing the expected version to validate against. This
      should be a properly formatted version string such as '1.13.2' or '3.3.5a'.
      The format must match the internal expected version structure.
  returns: Returns true if the provided version matches the expected version exactly;
    otherwise returns false. A return value of false typically indicates a mismatch
    that could prevent successful migration operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Version Validation
    code: "bool isValid = PlayerbotMigrationMgr::instance()->ValidateVersion(\"3.3.5a\"\
      );\nif (isValid)\n{\n    // Proceed with migration\n    sPlayerbotMigrationMgr->Migrate();\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle version mismatch\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"playerbots\"\
      , \"Version mismatch detected during validation.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger migration framework and may be called
    during server startup or configuration loading. The expected version string should
    align with the versioning scheme used by the TrinityCore project, typically following
    semantic versioning or build identifier patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that the expectedVersion parameter is properly formatted to avoid
    false negatives. Improperly formatted version strings might cause unexpected validation
    failures even when versions are compatible.
