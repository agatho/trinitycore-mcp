  class: TargetSelector
  method: EvaluateAllTargets
  signature: int TargetSelector::EvaluateAllTargets(const SelectionContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates all possible targets in the current selection context and returns
    the total number of valid targets found.
  description: The EvaluateAllTargets method iterates through all potential targets
    within the provided SelectionContext, applying target selection criteria to determine
    which targets are valid for the current AI decision-making process. This method
    is typically used by AI systems to assess the viability of multiple targets before
    selecting one for action. It performs checks such as target visibility, distance,
    threat level, and other relevant conditions defined in the context. The method
    returns an integer representing the count of valid targets that meet all selection
    criteria. This count can be used by calling code to make decisions about target
    acquisition or to determine if a suitable target exists for an ability or action.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the total number of valid targets found in
    the current selection context. A return value of zero indicates no valid targets
    were found, while a positive integer indicates the number of valid targets available
    for selection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Target Evaluation
    code: "int targetCount = selector.EvaluateAllTargets(context);\nif (targetCount\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with target selection logic\n    SelectBestTarget(context);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No valid targets available\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the AI's target selection process
    and may involve performance considerations when dealing with large numbers of
    potential targets. The SelectionContext parameter should be properly initialized
    before calling this method to ensure accurate evaluation results.
