documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotPriorityManager class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotPriorityManager
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the manager exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global bot priority configuration
    and management functionality. The returned pointer should be used carefully as
    it represents a globally accessible object that may be shared across multiple
    systems within the TrinityCore framework. This implementation typically involves
    lazy initialization where the instance is created on first access and then cached
    for subsequent calls.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotPriorityManager instance. The method never returns
    NULL as the singleton pattern ensures instantiation, though in rare cases of allocation
    failure, behavior may be undefined.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::instance();

      // Use manager to access bot priority settings

      uint32 priority = manager->GetBotPriority(BotType::QUEST);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Priority Configuration
    code: "void ConfigureBotPriorities() {\n    BotPriorityManager* instance = BotPriorityManager::instance();\n\
      \    instance->SetBotPriority(BotType::QUEST, 10);\n    instance->SetBotPriority(BotType::DUNGEON,\
      \ 20);\n    // Apply configuration changes\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in most TrinityCore implementations as the singleton
    instance is typically created during application startup. The singleton pattern
    ensures consistent access to bot priority configurations across different subsystems,
    but developers should be aware that modifications to the singleton state affect
    all components using it.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying the returned instance affects global
    state. Avoid storing references to the singleton instance for extended periods
    as it may lead to issues with object lifetime in certain scenarios. Be cautious
    when unit testing code that relies on this singleton pattern.
