documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes pet names from the database into memory for use in
    the game world.
  description: The LoadPetNames method retrieves all registered pet names from the
    database and stores them in an internal lookup structure within the ObjectMgr
    class. This allows the game to quickly access and validate pet names when players
    create or rename their pets. The method is typically called during server startup
    or database reload operations to ensure that pet naming data is available for
    gameplay mechanics. It handles loading of both default and custom pet names, ensuring
    consistency with the game's naming rules and restrictions.

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeWorld()\n{\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadPetNames();\n\
      \    // Pet names are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically during server startup as part
    of the ObjectMgr initialization sequence. The loaded pet names are stored in a
    hash map for fast lookup, which means performance is optimized for frequent access
    during gameplay operations such as pet creation or renaming.
