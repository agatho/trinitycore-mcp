  class: RestorationShamanRefactored
  method: ExecuteDamageRotation
  signature: void RestorationShamanRefactored::ExecuteDamageRotation(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the damage rotation for a restoration shaman, determining and applying
    the appropriate spell or ability based on combat state and resource management.
  description: The ExecuteDamageRotation method is responsible for managing the core
    damage execution logic of a restoration shaman class in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    environment. This method evaluates the current combat situation, available resources
    such as mana and elemental charges, and target conditions to determine which damage-dealing
    ability should be cast next. It typically integrates with the AI decision-making
    system to ensure optimal spell selection based on game mechanics like spell cooldowns,
    elemental alignment, and combat priority. The method operates within the context
    of a shaman's rotation strategy, balancing between different damage abilities
    such as Lava Burst, Chain Lightning, or other elemental spells while maintaining
    proper resource usage and cooldown management.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier for the
      damage rotation. This parameter is used to determine which enemy unit should
      be targeted by the next damage spell in the rotation sequence.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      shaman->ExecuteDamageRotation(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State
    code: "if (shaman->IsInCombat()) {\n    int targetId = shaman->GetVictim()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \    shaman->ExecuteDamageRotation(&targetId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and should be
    invoked only when the shaman is in combat. The target parameter must point to
    a valid enemy unit identifier; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Performance
    considerations include avoiding unnecessary spell checks or resource calculations
    that could slow down the rotation execution.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat context as it may lead to incorrect
    spell selection or resource depletion. Ensure that the target parameter points
    to an active and valid enemy unit to prevent errors in spell targeting logic.
