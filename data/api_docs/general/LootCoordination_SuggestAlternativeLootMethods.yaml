documentation:
  brief: Suggests alternative loot methods to group members during loot coordination.
  description: The SuggestAlternativeLootMethods function is responsible for proposing
    different loot distribution strategies to players within a group during the loot
    coordination process. This method typically handles the logic for suggesting options
    such as round-robin, free-for-all, or master loot, allowing group members to vote
    or agree on an alternative approach when the default loot rules are not suitable.
    It plays a key role in maintaining fairness and player satisfaction in group loot
    scenarios within TrinityCore's framework.

    code: "void ExampleUsage(Group* group)\n{\n    LootCoordination lootCoord;\n \
      \   lootCoord.SuggestAlternativeLootMethods(group);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot coordination events when players
    are unable to agree on a standard loot distribution method. It may involve sending
    messages or updates to group members and handling their responses.
