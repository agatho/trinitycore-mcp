  brief: Updates the visibility state of a temporary summon object upon creation.
  description: The UpdateObjectVisibilityOnCreate method is responsible for setting
    up the initial visibility state of a TempSummon object when it is created within
    the World of Warcraft environment. This method ensures that the summoned creature
    becomes visible to nearby players and other objects in the game world according
    to standard visibility rules. It typically handles the necessary internal state
    updates and sends appropriate network packets to clients so that the summon appears
    correctly in the player's view. The method is called automatically during the
    object creation process and should not be invoked manually under normal circumstances.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MySummon::OnSummonCreated()\n{\n    UpdateObjectVisibilityOnCreate();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal object lifecycle management and is automatically
    invoked during TempSummon creation. Developers should not call this method directly
    unless implementing custom summon behavior that requires explicit control over
    visibility updates.
