  brief: Resets the combat state analyzer to its initial default values.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the internal state of
    the CombatStateAnalyzer class, clearing any existing combat data and preparing
    it for a new analysis cycle. This method is typically invoked when starting a
    new combat encounter or when resetting the analyzer's tracking state. It ensures
    that all member variables are set to their default values, effectively clearing
    any previous combat-related information such as target tracking, damage history,
    or timing data. The method does not require any parameters and performs no return
    operations.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called before beginning a new combat analysis session
    to ensure accurate results. It is generally safe to call Reset multiple times
    without side effects.
