  class: AllWorldObjectsInRange
  method: AllWorldObjectsInRange
  signature: void AllWorldObjectsInRange::AllWorldObjectsInRange(const int * object,
    float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and processes all world objects within a specified range of a given
    object.
  description: The AllWorldObjectsInRange method searches for and retrieves all WorldObject
    instances that are within a defined maximum distance from a provided reference
    object. This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics such as spell targeting,
    area-of-effect calculations, or NPC awareness systems. The method operates on
    a spatial query using the underlying TrinityCore world object management system
    to efficiently locate nearby entities. It does not return a value directly but
    typically triggers callbacks or processes objects through internal iterators or
    handlers.
  parameters:
  - name: object
    description: Pointer to the reference WorldObject from which the range search
      originates. Must be a valid pointer to an existing WorldObject instance; null
      pointers will result in undefined behavior.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) within which to search for nearby world
      objects. Must be a positive floating-point number; negative values may cause
      unexpected results or errors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find nearby creatures
    code: 'Creature* target = ...; // some creature

      float range = 10.0f;

      AllWorldObjectsInRange(target, range);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with player object for area effect spell targeting
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // a player instance

      float radius = 25.0f;

      AllWorldObjectsInRange(player, radius);

      // Processes all objects within 25 yards of the player'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal spatial partitioning system of TrinityCore
    and is optimized for performance using grid-based lookups. It should be used carefully
    in high-frequency contexts to avoid performance degradation. The actual processing
    of found objects is typically handled by a callback mechanism or iterator pattern
    rather than returning a list directly.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for the 'object' parameter will likely lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the object remains valid throughout the duration
    of the method call, especially if used in asynchronous contexts. The maxRange
    value must be validated before calling to prevent invalid spatial queries.
