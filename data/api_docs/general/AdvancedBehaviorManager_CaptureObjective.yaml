  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: CaptureObjective
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::CaptureObjective(GameObject * objective)
documentation:
  brief: Captures a game object objective for the advanced behavior manager.
  description: The CaptureObjective method is used to register or acknowledge a GameObject
    as an objective within the AdvancedBehaviorManager's system. This method likely
    updates internal state tracking for objectives, potentially triggering associated
    behaviors or events when an objective is captured. It serves as a core mechanism
    for managing dynamic objectives in advanced AI systems, such as those found in
    battlegrounds or world events where objects like flags, doors, or capture points
    need to be monitored and acted upon by custom AI logic.
  parameters:
  - name: objective
    description: A pointer to the GameObject that represents the objective to be captured.
      This object must be valid and represent a legitimate game entity that can be
      tracked as an objective within the behavior manager's system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Objective Capture
    code: "GameObject* flag = player->FindNearestGameObject(GO_ID_FLAG, 10.0f);\n\
      if (flag)\n{\n    advancedBehaviorManager.CaptureObjective(flag);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Objective Capture with Validation
    code: "if (objective && objective->GetGOInfo() && objective->GetGOInfo()->type\
      \ == GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_FLAGSTAND)\n{\n    advancedBehaviorManager.CaptureObjective(objective);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid objective\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal tracking structures within AdvancedBehaviorManager
    to mark the given GameObject as a captured objective. It may trigger callbacks
    or event handlers associated with objective capture, and should be called only
    when the objective is confirmed to be valid and relevant to current AI behavior
    logic.
  warnings: Ensure that the GameObject pointer passed to this method is valid and
    not null before calling. Passing an invalid or destroyed GameObject can lead to
    undefined behavior or crashes. The method assumes the GameObject is already initialized
    and properly registered with the game world.
