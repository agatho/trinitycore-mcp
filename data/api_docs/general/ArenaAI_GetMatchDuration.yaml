  class: ArenaAI
  method: GetMatchDuration
  signature: uint32 ArenaAI::GetMatchDuration(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the duration of the current arena match in seconds.
  description: The GetMatchDuration method returns the elapsed time since the start
    of the current arena match, measured in seconds. This value is used internally
    by the ArenaAI system to manage match timing, player eligibility, and reward distribution.
    The method takes an optional pointer to a player integer which may be used to
    determine specific player-related timing or to validate that the calling context
    is appropriate for retrieving match duration data. The returned value represents
    the total time passed since the match began, not including any pause or break
    periods.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Optional pointer to an integer representing a player identifier.
      If provided, this parameter may be used internally by the AI system to validate
      context or retrieve specific player-related timing data. Can be NULL if no player-specific
      validation is required.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since
    the arena match started. Returns 0 if the match has not yet begun or if the method
    fails to retrieve valid timing data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 duration = arenaAI->GetMatchDuration();\nif (duration > 0)\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Arena match has been running for %u seconds\\n\", duration);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Player Context
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nuint32 duration = arenaAI->GetMatchDuration(&playerId);\n\
      if (duration > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Player %d has been in arena for %u seconds\\\
      n\", playerId, duration);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during match updates or when checking match
    state. It's important to note that the returned value reflects real-time elapsed
    time and may be affected by server tick rates or internal game timing mechanisms.
    The ArenaAI class likely manages its own internal timer, so this function provides
    a consistent interface for accessing match duration without direct access to global
    timers.
  warnings: Ensure that the ArenaAI instance is properly initialized before calling
    this method. Calling GetMatchDuration on an uninitialized or invalid ArenaAI object
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect timing values. Also, be cautious
    when passing non-NULL player pointers as they must point to valid data otherwise
    it could lead to memory access violations.
