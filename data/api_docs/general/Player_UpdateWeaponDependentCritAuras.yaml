  method: UpdateWeaponDependentCritAuras
  signature: void Player::UpdateWeaponDependentCritAuras(int attackType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates critical strike auras based on the player's current weapon and attack
    type.
  description: The UpdateWeaponDependentCritAuras method recalculates and applies
    critical strike auras that are dependent on the player's equipped weapons and
    the specified attack type. This method ensures that any weapon-specific critical
    strike modifiers, enchantments, or talents that affect the player's chance to
    land critical strikes are properly updated and applied. The method typically gets
    invoked during combat events such as weapon swings or spell casts to maintain
    accurate critical strike calculations for the given attack type. It is an internal
    utility method used by the core combat system to synchronize auras with current
    weapon state.
  parameters:
  - name: attackType
    description: An integer representing the type of attack being performed. Valid
      values include melee attacks (0), ranged attacks (1), and spell attacks (2).
      This determines which weapon-dependent critical strike modifiers should be considered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update crit auras for melee attack
    code: player->UpdateWeaponDependentCritAuras(0); // Update for melee attack
    language: cpp
  - title: Update crit auras for ranged attack
    code: player->UpdateWeaponDependentCritAuras(1); // Update for ranged attack
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the combat system and should
    not normally be invoked directly by external code. It relies on the player's current
    weapon state, enchantments, and active auras to determine the correct critical
    strike modifiers.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method may lead to inconsistent aura states
    if not properly synchronized with the combat flow. It is recommended to use this
    method only in specific scenarios where manual aura updates are required.
