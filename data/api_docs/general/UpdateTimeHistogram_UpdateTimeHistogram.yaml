documentation:
  brief: Updates the time histogram data structure with new timing measurements.
  description: The UpdateTimeHistogram method is responsible for updating internal
    timing statistics used for performance monitoring and profiling within the TrinityCore
    server. This method typically collects and processes timing data from various
    subsystems or operations, maintaining a histogram that tracks execution times
    over time. It may be invoked automatically by the system or manually during specific
    profiling scenarios. The updated histogram data can then be queried for performance
    analysis, helping developers identify bottlenecks or optimize server behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage in Performance Monitoring
    code: 'UpdateTimeHistogram histogram;

      histogram.UpdateTimeHistogram(); // Updates internal timing data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger performance monitoring system and
    may be called periodically or in response to specific events. It's important to
    understand that the actual implementation details are not provided, so this documentation
    assumes standard behavior for histogram update operations.
