  signature: bool CombatManager::UpdateOwnerCombatState() const
documentation:
  brief: Updates and returns the combat state of the owner entity.
  description: The UpdateOwnerCombatState method is responsible for refreshing and
    determining whether the owner of the CombatManager is currently engaged in combat.
    This method evaluates various factors such as active threat, pending attacks,
    or ongoing combat effects to accurately reflect the owner's current combat status.
    It typically gets invoked during combat updates or when checking the state of
    an entity involved in battle. The method does not modify any internal state directly
    but returns a boolean value indicating whether the owner is in combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the owner is currently in combat, false otherwise. This
    indicates whether the entity has active threat or is involved in ongoing combat
    mechanics.
  examples:
  - title: Check Combat State Before Attack
    code: "if (combatManager->UpdateOwnerCombatState()) {\n    // Owner is in combat,\
      \ proceed with attack logic\n    owner->Attack(target);\n} else {\n    // Owner\
      \ not in combat, handle accordingly\n    owner->SendChatMessage(\"I'm not in\
      \ combat!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used internally by the TrinityCore combat system to
    maintain accurate combat states for players and NPCs. It may be called frequently
    during combat updates, so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called on objects that are not properly
    initialized or have invalid owner references, as it could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
