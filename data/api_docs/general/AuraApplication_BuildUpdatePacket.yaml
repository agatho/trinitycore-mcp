  class: AuraApplication
  method: BuildUpdatePacket
  signature: void AuraApplication::BuildUpdatePacket(WorldPackets::Spells::AuraInfo
    & auraInfo, bool remove)
documentation:
  brief: Populates a WorldPackets::Spells::AuraInfo structure with aura application
    data for packet transmission.
  description: The BuildUpdatePacket method prepares aura application information
    into a structured format suitable for network transmission to clients. It fills
    the provided AuraInfo packet object with relevant details about the aura, such
    as its spell ID, duration, charges, and other properties. This method is typically
    invoked when updating aura states to players or when constructing update packets
    for synchronization between server and client. The remove parameter indicates
    whether the aura should be marked for removal in the packet, which affects how
    the client interprets the aura state. This function plays a crucial role in maintaining
    accurate aura state representation across the network.
  parameters:
  - name: auraInfo
    description: Reference to a WorldPackets::Spells::AuraInfo object that will be
      populated with aura application data for packet transmission.
  - name: remove
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the aura should be marked as removed
      in the packet. When true, the client will interpret this as an aura removal
      event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Aura Update Packet
    code: 'WorldPackets::Spells::AuraInfo auraInfo;

      auraApplication->BuildUpdatePacket(auraInfo, false);

      // auraInfo now contains the updated aura data ready for sending to client'
    language: cpp
  - title: Marking Aura for Removal
    code: 'WorldPackets::Spells::AuraInfo auraInfo;

      auraApplication->BuildUpdatePacket(auraInfo, true);

      // auraInfo is prepared with removal flags for client-side aura cleanup'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when preparing data for network transmission.
    The AuraApplication object must be in a valid state before calling this method.
    Performance-wise, it's a lightweight operation that primarily involves copying
    data into the packet structure.
