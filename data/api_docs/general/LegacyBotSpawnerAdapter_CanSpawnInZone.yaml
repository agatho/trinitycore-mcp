  method: CanSpawnInZone
  signature: bool LegacyBotSpawnerAdapter::CanSpawnInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can be spawned in the specified zone based on zone
    restrictions and configurations.
  description: The CanSpawnInZone method evaluates if it is permissible to spawn a
    legacy bot within a given zone. This check typically considers factors such as
    zone type (e.g., battlegrounds, arenas, non-pvp zones), player activity levels,
    and configuration settings defined in the TrinityCore server. The method ensures
    that bots are not spawned in areas where their presence would disrupt gameplay
    or violate server rules. It is commonly used during bot initialization and spawning
    logic to validate zone eligibility before attempting to create a new bot instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified zone allows bot spawning, false otherwise.
    The decision may depend on zone flags, server settings, and current game state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Bot Can Spawn in Zone
    code: "if (spawner->CanSpawnInZone(1234)) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawning\
      \ logic\n    spawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Log or handle invalid zone\n\
      \    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Cannot spawn bot in zone 1234\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches zone validation results for performance reasons.
    It may also integrate with existing TrinityCore systems such as instance management
    and player tracking to ensure accurate decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the zone ID passed to this method is valid; invalid IDs might
    cause unexpected behavior or crashes. Also, be aware that this check does not
    guarantee a successful spawn, only eligibility.
