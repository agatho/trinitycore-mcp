  brief: Increments the current player count in the world
  description: The IncreasePlayerCount method is used to increment the total number
    of players currently connected to the TrinityCore server. This method is typically
    called when a new player character logs into the game world. The method updates
    an internal counter that tracks active player connections, which is used for various
    game systems including server load balancing, population tracking, and maximum
    player limit enforcement. This method does not perform any validation on the player
    connection state and assumes the player has successfully authenticated and is
    ready to enter the world.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Login Handler
    code: "void PlayerLoginHandler(Player* player)\n{\n    // Perform login logic\n\
      \    World::Instance()->IncreasePlayerCount();\n    // Continue with player\
      \ entry into world\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the authentication and login systems
    when a player successfully authenticates. The implementation likely involves atomic
    operations or mutex locking to ensure thread safety when multiple players are
    logging in simultaneously. The counter maintained by this method may be used by
    other subsystems such as the realm population system or server status reporting.
  warnings: This method should only be called after successful player authentication
    and connection establishment. Calling it without proper player state validation
    may lead to incorrect player count tracking, which could affect server performance
    monitoring and player limit enforcement systems.
