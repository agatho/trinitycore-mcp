  brief: Processes and validates incoming guild emblem save data from a client packet
  description: The ReadPacket method handles deserialization of the SaveGuildEmblem
    packet received from a client, extracting and validating emblem-related data such
    as border style, background color, and emblem design. This method is part of the
    guild management system in TrinityCore and ensures that only valid emblem configurations
    are accepted when players attempt to save their guild's emblem. The method performs
    internal validation on the received data to prevent invalid or malicious emblem
    configurations from being stored.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: Reference to the WorldPackets::Guild::SaveGuildEmblem packet containing
      the client's requested emblem changes
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet reading example
    code: "void HandleGuildEmblemSave(WorldPackets::Guild::SaveGuildEmblem& packet)\n\
      {\n    EmblemInfo emblemInfo;\n    emblemInfo.ReadPacket(packet);\n    // Packet\
      \ data is now processed and validated\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the server-side and should only be called when a
    valid guild emblem save packet is received. The method assumes that the packet
    has already been properly decrypted and authenticated by the network layer.
  warnings: Do not call this method with untrusted or unvalidated packet data, as
    it may lead to invalid emblem configurations being processed. Ensure proper authentication
    checks are performed before calling this method.
