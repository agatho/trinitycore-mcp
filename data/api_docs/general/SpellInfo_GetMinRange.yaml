  class: SpellInfo
  method: GetMinRange
  signature: float SpellInfo::GetMinRange(bool positive) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the minimum range of the spell in meters.
  description: This method retrieves the minimum range value for a spell, which defines
    the closest distance at which the spell can be cast. The range is typically measured
    from the caster's position to the target's position and is crucial for determining
    spell validity and game mechanics such as spell targeting and positioning. The
    positive parameter determines whether to return the range for positive or negative
    effects, with positive indicating the minimum range for beneficial spells and
    negative indicating the minimum range for harmful spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the minimum range in meters. A value
    of 0.0 indicates no minimum range restriction, while positive values indicate
    the minimum distance required for spell casting.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "float minRange = spellInfo->GetMinRange(true);\nif (minRange > 0.0f)\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Minimum range: \" << minRange << \" meters\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with spell targeting
    code: "float minRange = spellInfo->GetMinRange(false);\nfloat maxRange = spellInfo->GetMaxRange(false);\n\
      if (minRange > 0.0f && maxRange > 0.0f)\n    std::cout << \"Spell range: \"\
      \ << minRange << \" to \" << maxRange << \" meters\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell range methods
    like GetMaxRange and GetRange. The value returned represents the minimum distance
    in meters, which may be affected by various factors including spell modifiers
    and game mechanics. This method is part of the SpellInfo class and should be used
    carefully as it may not always return accurate values depending on how the spell
    was defined.
  warnings: This method may return 0.0f for spells that do not have a minimum range
    restriction, which can lead to confusion in spell targeting logic if not handled
    properly. Be cautious when using this method with negative effects, as it might
    not always return expected values depending on how the spell was defined.
