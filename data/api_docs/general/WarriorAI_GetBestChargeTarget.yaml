  class: WarriorAI
  method: GetBestChargeTarget
  signature: ::Unit * WarriorAI::GetBestChargeTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most optimal target unit for performing a charge
    ability in the context of a warrior AI.
  description: The GetBestChargeTarget method evaluates available enemy targets within
    the warrior's current threat list or aggro range to identify the most suitable
    candidate for executing a charge ability. This method considers factors such as
    distance, threat level, and target validity to ensure that the chosen target maximizes
    the effectiveness of the charge. It is typically invoked during AI decision-making
    processes when a warrior unit has the capability to perform a charge attack, often
    in response to specific combat conditions or ability cooldowns. The method ensures
    that the returned target is valid and within the scope of the warrior's current
    engagement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the best target for charging,
    or nullptr if no suitable target is found within the AI's evaluation criteria.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in warrior AI logic
    code: "if (Unit* target = ai->GetBestChargeTarget()) {\n    // Execute charge\
      \ ability on target\n    me->CastSpell(target, SPELL_CHARGE, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the WarriorAI class and assumes that the AI has access
    to valid threat data and target information. It may internally use internal AI
    logic such as threat tables or target selection algorithms to determine the optimal
    charge target.
  warnings: Ensure that the warrior unit has sufficient range and line-of-sight to
    the returned target before attempting to execute a charge, as failure to do so
    may result in the ability failing or being wasted.
