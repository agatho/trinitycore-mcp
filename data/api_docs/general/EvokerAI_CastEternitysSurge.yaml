  class: EvokerAI
  method: CastEternitysSurge
  signature: void EvokerAI::CastEternitysSurge(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Casts the Eternity's Surge spell on the specified target.
  description: The CastEternitysSurge method is responsible for executing the Eternity's
    Surge ability within the Evoker AI system. This method takes a pointer to an integer
    representing the target unit and performs the necessary spell casting logic, including
    validation of the target, checking for valid spell conditions, and initiating
    the spell effect. The method is typically invoked as part of the Evoker's combat
    behavior when specific tactical conditions are met. It integrates with the core
    TrinityCore AI framework to ensure proper targeting and execution of the spell
    within the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target unit for the Eternity's
      Surge spell. The value should correspond to a valid GameObject, Creature, or
      Player GUID in the current instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CastEternitysSurge
    code: 'int targetGuid = 12345;

      this->CastEternitysSurge(&targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the EvokerAI instance has been properly initialized
    and that the target GUID is valid. The method does not perform explicit null checks
    on the target pointer, so callers should ensure the parameter is valid before
    invocation.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid or null targets may result in
    undefined behavior or crashes within the TrinityCore framework. Always validate
    the target before calling this method.
