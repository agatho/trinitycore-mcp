  class: FormationManager
  method: GetFormationSpacing
  signature: float FormationManager::GetFormationSpacing() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the spacing value used for formation positioning.
  description: The GetFormationSpacing method retrieves the current spacing configuration
    value that determines how far apart units are positioned within a formation. This
    value is typically used by the FormationManager to calculate and maintain proper
    distances between members of a group or unit formation in World of Warcraft. The
    returned float value represents the spacing in game units, which may vary based
    on the specific formation type and unit sizes involved.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current formation spacing in game units.
    This value is used to determine the distance between units when positioning them
    in a formation.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve formation spacing for debugging
    code: 'float spacing = formationManager->GetFormationSpacing();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("entities.unit", "Current formation spacing: {}", spacing);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during formation updates or initialization.
    The returned value may be influenced by unit types, formation types, and game
    settings. It's important to note that this spacing value is used in conjunction
    with other formation parameters like orientation and anchor points.
