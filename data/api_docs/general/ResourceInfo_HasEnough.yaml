  method: HasEnough
  signature: bool ResourceInfo::HasEnough(uint32 amount) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if the resource amount is sufficient for a given requirement.
  description: The HasEnough method evaluates whether the current resource value stored
    in the ResourceInfo object meets or exceeds the specified amount. This method
    is commonly used in game mechanics to validate player resources such as mana,
    energy, or gold before allowing actions like casting spells or purchasing items.
    It performs a simple comparison operation between the internal resource amount
    and the provided value, returning true if the resource is sufficient and false
    otherwise. The method does not modify any state and is typically called as part
    of conditional logic in game systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the current resource amount is greater than or equal to
    the specified amount; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Resource Check
    code: "ResourceInfo playerMana;\nplayerMana.SetAmount(100);\nif (playerMana.HasEnough(75))\
      \ {\n    // Player has enough mana to cast spell\n    CastSpell();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Inventory Resource Validation
    code: "ResourceInfo gold;\ngold.SetAmount(500);\nuint32 itemCost = 300;\nif (gold.HasEnough(itemCost))\
      \ {\n    // Deduct cost and purchase item\n    gold.SetAmount(gold.GetAmount()\
      \ - itemCost);\n    PurchaseItem();\n} else {\n    // Insufficient funds\n \
      \   SendErrorMessage(\"Not enough gold.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the ResourceInfo object has been properly initialized
    with a valid resource amount. The comparison is performed using unsigned integer
    arithmetic, so negative values should not be passed as parameters. Performance
    is optimal as it's a simple comparison operation.
  warnings: Ensure that the ResourceInfo object contains a valid resource value before
    calling this method. While the method itself doesn't modify state, improper initialization
    of the resource amount can lead to incorrect validation results.
