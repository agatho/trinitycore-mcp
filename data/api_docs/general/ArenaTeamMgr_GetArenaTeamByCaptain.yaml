  class: ArenaTeamMgr
  method: GetArenaTeamByCaptain
  signature: ArenaTeam * ArenaTeamMgr::GetArenaTeamByCaptain(int guid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an arena team by the GUID of its captain.
  description: The GetArenaTeamByCaptain method searches through all registered arena
    teams to find the one whose captain matches the provided GUID. This method is
    typically used in World of Warcraft's arena system to locate a specific team when
    only the captain's unique identifier is known. It performs a linear search through
    the internal arena team registry and returns a pointer to the matching ArenaTeam
    object if found, or nullptr if no team with the specified captain exists. The
    method is const, meaning it does not modify any internal state of the ArenaTeamMgr
    instance.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the arena team captain to search
      for. This should be a valid player GUID from the game's database.
  returns: A pointer to the ArenaTeam object if a team with the specified captain
    GUID is found; otherwise, returns nullptr if no matching team exists.
  examples:
  - title: Find arena team by captain GUID
    code: "uint32 captainGuid = 12345;\nArenaTeam* team = sArenaTeamMgr->GetArenaTeamByCaptain(captainGuid);\n\
      if (team)\n{\n    // Team found, use team object\n    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_TEAM_FOUND,\
      \ team->GetName().c_str());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No team found with this captain\n\
      \    sWorld->SendWorldText(LANG_ARENA_TEAM_NOT_FOUND);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through all arena teams, so performance
    may degrade with a large number of teams. The ArenaTeamMgr should be properly
    initialized before calling this method. This function is thread-safe as it only
    reads from the arena team registry without modifying it.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned pointer directly without checking
    for null, as dereferencing a nullptr will cause a crash. Ensure that the GUID
    passed in corresponds to an actual player who is a captain of an arena team.
