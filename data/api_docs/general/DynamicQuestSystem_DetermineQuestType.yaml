  class: DynamicQuestSystem
  method: DetermineQuestType
  signature: QuestType DynamicQuestSystem::DetermineQuestType(const Quest * quest)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the type of a given quest based on its properties
    and flags.
  description: The DetermineQuestType method analyzes the provided Quest object and
    identifies its specific type by examining internal quest flags, objectives, and
    other relevant attributes. This method is essential for categorizing quests within
    the dynamic quest system, enabling different handling behaviors depending on whether
    a quest is daily, weekly, seasonal, event-based, or standard. The returned QuestType
    enum allows the game logic to route quest-related operations appropriately, such
    as reward distribution, tracking, or UI display. The method assumes that the input
    Quest pointer is valid and properly initialized within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a QuestType enumeration value indicating the categorized type of
    the quest. Possible values may include QT_NORMAL, QT_DAILY, QT_WEEKLY, QT_SEASONAL,
    QT_EVENT, or QT_NONE if the quest cannot be classified.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nQuestType type\
      \ = dynamicQuestSystem.DetermineQuestType(quest);\nif (type == QT_DAILY)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle daily quest logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest data structures and should only be called
    after the quest has been fully loaded into memory. Performance is generally fast
    as it operates on cached quest data, but repeated calls on large numbers of quests
    may impact frame rate during quest loading sequences.
  warnings: Ensure that the Quest pointer passed to this method is not null or invalid;
    otherwise, behavior is undefined and may lead to crashes or incorrect type classification.
