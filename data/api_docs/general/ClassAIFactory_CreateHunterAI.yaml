  signature: int ClassAIFactory::CreateHunterAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new hunter AI instance for a bot character.
  description: The CreateHunterAI method is responsible for instantiating a hunter
    AI behavior for a bot character within the TrinityCore framework. This function
    allocates memory for the AI component, sets up the necessary hunting behaviors,
    and configures the bot's combat logic specific to hunter class mechanics. The
    method typically integrates with the broader AI system to manage pet behavior,
    spell casting, and target selection. It requires that the bot character is properly
    initialized before calling this method, and it returns a status code indicating
    success or failure of the AI creation process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or handle.
      This parameter is used to associate the newly created AI with the specific bot
      instance.
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success status of the AI creation
    process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation, while non-zero
    values may represent various error conditions such as invalid bot handle, insufficient
    memory, or failed initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of CreateHunterAI
    code: "int botId = 12345;\nint result = factory->CreateHunterAI(&botId);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // AI successfully created for bot\n    printf(\"Hunter AI created\
      \ for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed\
      \ to create Hunter AI for bot %d\\n\", botId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's bot AI system and assumes that the
    underlying bot infrastructure has been properly initialized. The returned integer
    status code should be checked to ensure successful AI creation before attempting
    to use the AI components.
  warnings: Calling this method without a valid bot handle may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot parameter points to a valid, initialized
    bot instance before invoking this function.
