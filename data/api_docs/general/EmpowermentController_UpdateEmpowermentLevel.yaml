  signature: void EmpowermentController::UpdateEmpowermentLevel()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the empowerment level of the controller based on current game state
    and conditions.
  description: The UpdateEmpowermentLevel method is responsible for recalculating
    and applying the current empowerment state for an object controlled by the EmpowermentController.
    This typically involves checking various in-game factors such as player actions,
    buffs, debuffs, or environmental conditions that affect empowerment. The method
    ensures that the empowerment level is accurately reflected in the game world,
    which may influence abilities, stats, or other gameplay mechanics tied to empowerment.
    It is generally called during game ticks or when specific events occur that could
    alter the empowerment state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameWorld::Update()\n{\n    // Update all controllers\n    for (auto&\
      \ controller : m_empowermentControllers)\n    {\n        controller->UpdateEmpowermentLevel();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggered by Player Action
    code: "void Player::OnAbilityUsed()\n{\n    // Update empowerment after using\
      \ an ability\n    m_empowermentController->UpdateEmpowermentLevel();\n    //\
      \ Apply updated empowerment effects\n    ApplyEmpowermentEffects();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to ensure accurate
    empowerment state. It may involve performance-intensive calculations depending
    on the complexity of empowerment rules implemented in the system.
  warnings: Calling this method too frequently without proper throttling can cause
    performance issues. Ensure that it's only invoked when necessary, such as after
    significant gameplay events or at fixed intervals rather than every frame.
