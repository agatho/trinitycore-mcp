  method: AddIllusionBlock
  signature: void Player::AddIllusionBlock(uint32 blockValue)
documentation:
  brief: Adds an illusion block to the player's inventory.
  description: This method adds a specified illusion block item to the player's inventory,
    allowing them to use it for cosmetic purposes. The method is typically used in
    conjunction with other player-related functions to manage equipment and appearance.
    It operates within the context of World of Warcraft's item system where players
    can acquire and manage various items including illusions. The function likely
    modifies the player's inventory or equipment slot to accommodate the new illusion
    block.
  parameters:
  - name: blockValue
    description: The value representing the illusion block to be added, typically
      corresponding to a specific item ID or type that defines the cosmetic appearance
      of the block.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->AddIllusionBlock(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      uint32 blockID = 54321;

      player->AddIllusionBlock(blockID);

      // This would add a specific illusion block to the player''s inventory'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details suggest that this method likely interacts with the
    player's inventory system, possibly modifying the item database or equipment slots.
    Performance considerations may include inventory space limitations and potential
    for item stacking issues.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it might affect the player's inventory
    management and could potentially cause conflicts if multiple items are added simultaneously.
    Care should be taken to ensure that the blockValue is valid and corresponds to
    an actual illusion block in the game database.
