  method: CalculateHonorGain
  signature: uint32 Quest::CalculateHonorGain(uint8 level) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the amount of honor a player will gain for completing the quest
    based on the provided level.
  description: The CalculateHonorGain method computes the honor reward that a player
    receives upon completing a quest. This calculation is dependent on the player's
    level, which is passed as an argument to the function. The method is typically
    used internally by the game engine to determine the appropriate honor reward for
    quest completion. It does not modify any state and is purely a computational function.
    The result represents the base honor value that would be awarded without considering
    any bonus multipliers or modifiers from achievements, guild bonuses, or other
    factors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the base honor amount that will be
    awarded to the player upon completing this quest at the specified level. The value
    is zero if no honor is awarded for the quest or if the calculation fails.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);

      uint32 honorGain = quest->CalculateHonorGain(60);

      // honorGain now contains the base honor reward for completing quest 12345 at
      level 60'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core quest system and is called during quest completion
    processing. It uses internal quest data to compute the honor value, so it assumes
    that the quest has been properly initialized with valid data. The level parameter
    should be a valid player level (typically between 1 and 80 in most expansions).
