  method: GetStartingLevel
  signature: uint8 BotCharacterCreator::GetStartingLevel(uint8 race, uint8 classId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the starting level for a bot character based on race and class.
  description: The GetStartingLevel method determines the initial level assigned to
    a bot character when it is created. This method takes into account both the racial
    and class-specific starting levels defined within the TrinityCore framework. The
    returned value represents the level at which the bot character will begin its
    gameplay experience, ensuring consistency with game mechanics and balance considerations.
    This method is typically used during the character creation process for automated
    or AI-controlled characters.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The racial identifier of the character (e.g., Human = 1, Orc = 2,
      etc.). Must be a valid race ID defined in the game constants.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier of the character (e.g., Warrior = 1, Mage =
      8, etc.). Must be a valid class ID defined in the game constants.
  returns: Returns a uint8 value representing the starting level for the specified
    race and class combination. Typical values range from 1 to 80, depending on the
    character's race and class.
  examples:
  - title: Get Starting Level for Human Warrior
    code: 'uint8 level = creator.GetStartingLevel(1, 1); // Human (1) Warrior (1)

      // Returns: 1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Get Starting Level for Undead Mage
    code: 'uint8 level = creator.GetStartingLevel(5, 8); // Undead (5) Mage (8)

      // Returns: 1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal game data tables or configuration files
    to determine starting levels. It may be affected by server-side configurations
    or expansion-specific rules. The method assumes valid inputs for race and class
    parameters.
  warnings: Passing invalid race or class IDs may result in undefined behavior or
    incorrect level assignments. Ensure that the provided values correspond to valid
    entries in the game's race and class databases.
