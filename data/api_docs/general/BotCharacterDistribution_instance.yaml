documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the BotCharacterDistribution class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the BotCharacterDistribution
    class, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is typically used to access global configuration or distribution
    data related to bot character generation and allocation within the TrinityCore
    environment. The returned instance can be used to query or modify bot character
    distribution settings, such as spawn rates, level distributions, or class allocations
    for AI-controlled characters.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single BotCharacterDistribution instance. The method will
    always return a valid pointer; it does not return NULL under normal circumstances.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Bot Character Distribution Settings
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution* distribution = BotCharacterDistribution::instance();

      uint32 spawnRate = distribution->GetSpawnRate();

      uint32 levelRangeMin = distribution->GetLevelRangeMin();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the classic singleton pattern implementation. The instance
    is typically created on first access and persists for the duration of the application.
    Developers should be aware that modifying the singleton instance affects all parts
    of the codebase that use it.
