  class: BotScheduler
  method: AssignPattern
  signature: void BotScheduler::AssignPattern(int guid, const std::string & patternName)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns a specified behavior pattern to a bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The AssignPattern method is used to assign a predefined behavior pattern
    to a specific bot within the TrinityCore AI system. This allows for dynamic control
    over bot behaviors, enabling administrators or scripts to modify how individual
    bots act in the game world. The method takes a bot's unique identifier (GUID)
    and a pattern name string, which corresponds to a defined behavior set in the
    system. It is typically used in conjunction with pattern management systems that
    define various bot actions such as combat strategies, movement patterns, or interaction
    behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot to which the pattern will
      be assigned. This value must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: patternName
    description: A string representing the name of the behavior pattern to assign.
      This should match a predefined pattern registered with the AI system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pattern Assignment
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.AssignPattern(12345, "CombatAssault");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Pattern Assignment Based on Conditions
    code: "if (player->GetLevel() > 60) {\n    scheduler.AssignPattern(botGuid, \"\
      AdvancedRaidStrategy\");\n} else {\n    scheduler.AssignPattern(botGuid, \"\
      BasicQuesting\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal bot state management and may trigger
    updates to the bot's current AI behavior. It is recommended to validate that the
    pattern name exists before calling this method to avoid runtime errors.
  warnings: Assigning an invalid pattern name or a GUID that does not correspond to
    an active bot may result in undefined behavior or silent failures. Ensure all
    parameters are validated prior to calling this function.
