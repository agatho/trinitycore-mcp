documentation:
  brief: Checks if the hunter has the correct aspect active for Beast Mastery specialization.
  description: This method determines whether the hunter currently has an aspect applied
    that is appropriate for the Beast Mastery hunter specialization. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, this typically involves verifying that an aspect such
    as Aspect of the Hawk or Aspect of the Cheetah is active on the player. The check
    considers the hunter's current specialization and ensures compatibility with the
    active aspect. This method is used internally by the game engine to validate hunter
    abilities and maintain proper gameplay mechanics for Beast Mastery hunters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has a valid Beast Mastery aspect active, false
    otherwise. The method returns false when no appropriate aspect is active or when
    the hunter's specialization does not match the active aspect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate aspect
    code: "if (hunter->HasCorrectAspect()) {\n    // Proceed with Beast Mastery abilities\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Valid aspect active\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid aspect state\n    std::cout << \"Invalid aspect - please apply correct\
      \ aspect\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against the hunter's current active auras
    and specialization state. It may be called during ability validation or before
    executing Beast Mastery-specific actions to ensure proper gameplay mechanics are
    maintained.
