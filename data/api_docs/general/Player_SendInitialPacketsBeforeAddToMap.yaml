documentation:
  brief: Sends initial packets to player before adding them to the map
  description: This method is responsible for sending the initial set of packets to
    a player object before it is added to the game world map. It typically includes
    sending player data, character creation packets, and other essential information
    required for the player's client to properly initialize their connection. The
    method ensures that all necessary data is transmitted before the player becomes
    active in the world, preventing potential client-side issues or synchronization
    problems.

  notes: This method is typically called during the player initialization process
    and should be invoked before the player is added to the map. It's important to
    note that this method may involve sending multiple packets depending on the player's
    current state, including character creation data, inventory information, and other
    essential client-side data.
