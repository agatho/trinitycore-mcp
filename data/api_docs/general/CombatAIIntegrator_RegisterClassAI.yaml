  signature: void CombatAIIntegrator::RegisterClassAI(ClassAI * classAI)
documentation:
  brief: Registers a ClassAI instance with the CombatAIIntegrator for use in combat
    behavior management.
  description: The RegisterClassAI method integrates a ClassAI object into the CombatAIIntegrator's
    system, allowing the AI to be utilized during combat scenarios. This method typically
    stores the provided ClassAI instance internally so that it can be retrieved and
    applied to units during combat situations. The integration process likely involves
    setting up necessary callbacks or references required for the AI to function within
    the game's combat framework. It is expected that this method is called during
    initialization or setup phases before the AI system is actively used in combat.
  parameters:
  - name: classAI
    description: Pointer to the ClassAI instance to be registered. Must not be null
      and should represent a valid AI implementation for a specific class or unit
      type.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Registration Example
    code: 'ClassAI* myAI = new WarriorAI();

      CombatAIIntegrator::Instance()->RegisterClassAI(myAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple AI Registration
    code: 'RegisterClassAI(new MageAI());

      RegisterClassAI(new RogueAI());

      RegisterClassAI(new PriestAI());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs internal bookkeeping to maintain a registry of
    available AIs. It may also validate that the ClassAI instance is compatible with
    the current combat system or game state. The registration process might be thread-safe,
    but it's recommended to perform this during server initialization or safe update
    periods.
  warnings: Ensure that the ClassAI pointer passed to this method remains valid for
    the lifetime of the CombatAIIntegrator. Do not register AI instances that have
    already been unregistered or destroyed, as this could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
