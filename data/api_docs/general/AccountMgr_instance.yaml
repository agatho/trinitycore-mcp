documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AccountMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the AccountMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the account management manager exists
    throughout the TrinityCore server runtime. This method is used to obtain access
    to the global account management functionality, which handles operations such
    as account authentication, permission checks, and account-related data retrieval.
    The returned pointer should be used directly without attempting to delete or manage
    its lifetime, as it represents a globally managed singleton object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single, globally shared instance of the AccountMgr class.
    This pointer is never null in normal operation and should not be deleted by callers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AccountMgr* accountMgr = AccountMgr::instance();

      bool isValid = accountMgr->CheckPassword("player123", "correctpassword");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Accessing Account Data
    code: "AccountMgr* mgr = AccountMgr::instance();\nuint32 accountId = mgr->GetAccountId(\"\
      testuser\");\nif (accountId > 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with account operations\n\
      \    uint32 securityLevel = mgr->GetSecurity(accountId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it's implemented using the Meyers singleton
    pattern, which ensures proper initialization in a multi-threaded environment.
    The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the lifetime
    of the application.
  warnings: Do not attempt to delete or manage the returned pointer's memory. The
    singleton instance is managed automatically by the system. Calling this method
    from multiple threads simultaneously is safe, but be cautious when modifying account
    data concurrently.
