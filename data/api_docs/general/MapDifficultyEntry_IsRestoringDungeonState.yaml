  signature: bool MapDifficultyEntry::IsRestoringDungeonState() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the map difficulty entry is configured to restore dungeon
    state.
  description: The IsRestoringDungeonState method checks if a specific map difficulty
    entry is set to restore the dungeon's previous state upon player entry. This functionality
    is typically used in scenarios where players re-enter a dungeon after leaving,
    and the system needs to determine whether to reset the dungeon or maintain its
    current state. The method returns true if the dungeon state restoration is enabled
    for this particular difficulty setting, otherwise false. This behavior is crucial
    for maintaining game consistency in dynamic dungeon environments such as raids
    or heroic instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the map difficulty entry has
    dungeon state restoration enabled. True means the dungeon state will be restored
    upon re-entry; false means it will reset to default state.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Dungeon State Restoration is Enabled
    code: "MapDifficultyEntry* difficultyEntry = sMapDifficultyStore.LookupEntry(5);\
      \ // Example entry ID\nif (difficultyEntry->IsRestoringDungeonState()) {\n \
      \   printf(\"Dungeon state will be restored on re-entry.\\n\");\n} else {\n\
      \    printf(\"Dungeon will reset to default state on re-entry.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in the context of dungeon and raid management
    within TrinityCore's core systems. It directly influences how instance data is
    handled when players enter or exit a map with specific difficulty settings.
