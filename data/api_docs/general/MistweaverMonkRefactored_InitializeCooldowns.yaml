documentation:
  brief: Initializes cooldowns for Mistweaver Monk abilities.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up and configures all cooldown
    timers for the Mistweaver Monk class. This includes initializing base cooldown
    values for key abilities such as Enveloping Mist, Renewing Mist, and other class-specific
    spells. The method ensures that all cooldowns are properly reset at the start
    of a new encounter or character session, preventing any unintended behavior due
    to leftover cooldown states. It typically runs during the initialization phase
    of the monk's AI system or when a new combat round begins.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Initialization
    code: "void MyMistweaverAI::OnInitialize()\n{\n    InitializeCooldowns();\n  \
      \  // Additional initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once during the initialization phase of a Mistweaver
    Monk's AI behavior. It is important to ensure that this method is not called repeatedly
    during active combat, as it may reset cooldowns prematurely.
