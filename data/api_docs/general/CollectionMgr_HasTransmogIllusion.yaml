documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the player has a specific transmog illusion in their collection.
  description: The HasTransmogIllusion method determines if a player has acquired
    and unlocked a particular transmog illusion within their collection. This method
    is typically used in game logic to verify access to cosmetic appearance modifications
    that can be applied to items through the transmogrification system. It checks
    against the player's known illusions and returns true if the specified illusion
    ID exists in their collection, false otherwise. The method does not modify any
    state and is read-only in nature.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player has the specified transmog illusion in their
    collection; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (collectionMgr->HasTransmogIllusion(12345)) {\n    // Player has illusion\
      \ ID 12345\n    // Proceed with transmog logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Transmog Application
    code: "uint32 illusionId = 98765;\nif (collectionMgr->HasTransmogIllusion(illusionId))\
      \ {\n    // Apply transmog effect\n    player->ApplyTransmogEffect(illusionId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle missing illusion case\n    player->SendSystemMessage(\"\
      You do not have this illusion unlocked.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the CollectionMgr which tracks
    the illusions a player has acquired. It is assumed that the illusion ID passed
    to this method corresponds to a valid transmog illusion in the game's database.
    The method may be optimized for performance by caching or indexing known illusion
    IDs.
  warnings: Ensure that the illusion ID being checked is valid and exists within the
    game's transmog system; invalid IDs might lead to unexpected behavior or errors
    depending on implementation details. This method should not be used to validate
    user input directly without additional checks.
