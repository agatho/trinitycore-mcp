  class: ReputationMgr
  method: SetVisible
  signature: void ReputationMgr::SetVisible(const FactionEntry * factionEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the visibility state of a faction entry for the player's reputation
    display.
  description: The SetVisible method controls whether a specific faction's reputation
    level is shown in the player's UI. This method modifies the internal state of
    the ReputationMgr to determine if a faction should appear as visible or hidden
    in the character's reputation list. The visibility setting affects how the faction
    appears in the game interface, but does not alter the actual reputation value
    or progression. This functionality is typically used when factions need to be
    temporarily hidden from the player's view, such as during certain quest events
    or for special faction states.
  parameters:
  - name: factionEntry
    description: Pointer to the FactionEntry structure that defines the faction whose
      visibility will be modified. This parameter must not be null and should reference
      a valid faction entry from the game's faction database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Make a faction visible
    code: "FactionEntry const* faction = sFactionStore.LookupEntry(1194); // Example\
      \ faction ID\nif (faction)\n{\n    player->GetReputationMgr().SetVisible(faction);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects the display state of the faction in the UI. It does
    not modify any underlying reputation values or progression. The visibility change
    is typically persisted across sessions unless explicitly reset.
