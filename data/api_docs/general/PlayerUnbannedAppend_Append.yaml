  brief: Appends player unbanned notification data to a channel notify packet
  description: The Append method populates a WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify
    packet with data indicating that a player has been unbanned from a channel. This
    method is typically used in the context of handling channel management operations
    within the TrinityCore framework, specifically when notifying clients about changes
    to channel membership permissions. The method modifies the provided packet in-place
    without returning any value. It is part of the PlayerUnbannedAppend class which
    handles the construction of unbanning-related notifications for channel communications.

    code: 'PlayerUnbannedAppend unbannedAppend;

      WorldPackets::Channel::ChannelNotify notifyPacket;

      unbannedAppend.Append(notifyPacket);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the input packet object and should only be
    called when a player unbanning event occurs. The method assumes that proper context
    and data validation have already been performed before invocation.
