api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: ValidateAppearance
  signature: bool WorldSession::ValidateAppearance(int race, int playerClass, int
    gender, int customizations)
documentation:
  brief: Validates if the provided character appearance settings are acceptable for
    the specified race, class, and gender.
  description: The ValidateAppearance method checks whether a given combination of
    race, class, gender, and customizations is valid for character creation or appearance
    modification in World of Warcraft. This method ensures that players cannot select
    invalid combinations such as a Night Elf warrior or a Human with certain racial
    customizations. It performs internal validation against game rules and database
    constraints to maintain game integrity and prevent exploits. The method typically
    gets called during character creation, appearance updates, or when applying cosmetic
    changes to ensure compliance with Blizzard's character design restrictions.
  parameters:
  - name: race
    description: The race ID of the character (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for Orc, etc.).
      Must correspond to valid race IDs in the game database.
  - name: playerClass
    description: The class ID of the character (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin,
      etc.). Must correspond to valid class IDs in the game database.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the character (0 for Male, 1 for Female). Invalid values
      will cause validation to fail.
  - name: customizations
    description: A bitmask or integer value representing various appearance customizations
      such as facial features, hair style, and skin tone. The exact format depends
      on the game client version and internal implementation.
  returns: Returns true if the provided combination of race, class, gender, and customizations
    is valid for character creation or appearance modification; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic validation check
    code: "if (session->ValidateAppearance(1, 1, 0, 0x12345678)) {\n    // Valid appearance\
      \ combination\n    SendCharacterCreateSuccess();\n} else {\n    // Invalid appearance\
      \ combination\n    SendCharacterCreateFailed();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking appearance validity before applying changes
    code: "void ApplyAppearanceChange(WorldSession* session, int newRace, int newClass,\
      \ int newGender, int newCustomizations) {\n    if (session->ValidateAppearance(newRace,\
      \ newClass, newGender, newCustomizations)) {\n        // Update character appearance\n\
      \        UpdateCharacterAppearance(newRace, newClass, newGender, newCustomizations);\n\
      \        SendAppearanceUpdate();\n    } else {\n        // Reject invalid appearance\
      \ change\n        SendInvalidAppearanceError();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal lookup tables or database queries to
    verify valid race-class combinations. It may also perform checks against known
    forbidden combinations or deprecated appearances. The customizations parameter
    might be a packed structure or bitmask that encodes multiple appearance attributes.
  warnings: Do not call this method without proper validation of input parameters,
    as invalid inputs could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. This method should
    only be used in contexts where character creation or appearance changes are being
    processed, and it's crucial to ensure the session is valid before calling.
