  class: ShadowDoTTracker
  method: ApplyVampiricTouch
  signature: void ShadowDoTTracker::ApplyVampiricTouch(int guid, uint32 duration)
documentation:
  brief: Applies the Vampiric Touch spell effect to a target with specified duration.
  description: The ApplyVampiricTouch method is responsible for applying the Vampiric
    Touch spell debuff to a specified target unit. This shadow-based DoT (Damage over
    Time) effect causes the caster to drain health from the target and restore it
    to themselves. The method takes a GUID identifying the target and a duration in
    milliseconds, which determines how long the effect will persist. This functionality
    is typically used within the context of warlock spell casting mechanics in TrinityCore's
    implementation. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    related to shadow DoT tracking for the affected unit.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the target unit to apply Vampiric
      Touch to. This should be a valid GameObject, Creature, or Player GUID.
  - name: duration
    description: The duration in milliseconds for which the Vampiric Touch effect
      will remain active on the target. Typically corresponds to the spell's base
      duration plus any applicable modifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'ShadowDoTTracker tracker;

      tracker.ApplyVampiricTouch(12345, 18000); // Apply Vampiric Touch to target
      with GUID 12345 for 18 seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: "// Assuming we have a warlock spell handler\nvoid WarlockSpellHandler::CastVampiricTouch(Unit*\
      \ target)\n{\n    if (target)\n    {\n        ShadowDoTTracker tracker;\n  \
      \      tracker.ApplyVampiricTouch(target->GetGUID().GetRawValue(), 18000);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal tracking systems to manage active
    DoT effects. It may also update the target's aura state and trigger related events
    such as periodic damage application or healing absorption calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID corresponds to a valid unit before calling
    this method, as invalid GUIDs could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also,
    verify that duration values are within acceptable ranges to prevent overflow or
    excessive spell durations.
