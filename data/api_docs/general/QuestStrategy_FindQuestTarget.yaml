  method: FindQuestTarget
  signature: ::Unit * QuestStrategy::FindQuestTarget(BotAI * ai, const int & objective)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the quest target unit associated with the specified objective
    for the bot AI.
  description: The FindQuestTarget method is used within the TrinityCore bot AI system
    to locate a specific quest target unit based on an objective identifier. This
    method is typically invoked during quest progression to identify NPCs or objects
    that are relevant to completing a particular quest objective. The method takes
    a BotAI instance and an objective ID, then searches through the current quest
    context to return the appropriate Unit object. It is commonly used in bot behavior
    logic where automated actions need to be performed on specific quest targets such
    as killing creatures, interacting with NPCs, or collecting items.
  parameters:
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI instance that contains the context and state
      of the bot. This is required for accessing the bot's current quest data and
      target information.
  - name: objective
    description: Integer identifier representing the specific quest objective. This
      value corresponds to a particular quest target within the bot's current quest
      context, such as a creature ID or item requirement.
  returns: Returns a pointer to a Unit object that represents the quest target associated
    with the given objective. If no valid quest target is found for the specified
    objective, the method returns nullptr.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in bot AI logic
    code: "Unit* target = strategy->FindQuestTarget(ai, 12345);\nif (target && target->IsAlive())\
      \ {\n    ai->GetBot()->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using FindQuestTarget with error handling
    code: "Unit* questTarget = strategy->FindQuestTarget(ai, objectiveId);\nif (questTarget\
      \ == nullptr) {\n    // Handle case where no target is found\n    ai->GetBot()->Say(\"\
      No quest target found.\", LANG_UNIVERSAL);\n    return;\n}\n// Proceed with\
      \ targeting logic\nai->SetCurrentTarget(questTarget);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the BotAI's internal quest tracking system to map objective
    IDs to actual game objects. The method may return nullptr if the objective is
    not currently active or if the target has been destroyed or removed from the world.
    Performance-wise, this method typically performs a lookup within the bot's current
    quest context and should execute efficiently in most cases.
  warnings: Ensure that the objective parameter corresponds to an actual active quest
    objective before calling this method. Calling with invalid or outdated objective
    IDs may result in nullptr returns and unexpected behavior in bot AI logic. The
    returned Unit pointer should always be checked for null before use to prevent
    segmentation faults.
