documentation:
  brief: Casts the Arcane Intellect spell on the MageAI's target or self.
  description: The CastArcaneIntellect method is responsible for casting the Arcane
    Intellect spell, a crucial buff that increases the intellect of the caster or
    target by a significant amount. This method is typically invoked within the MageAI
    class to manage spellcasting behavior during combat or non-combat scenarios. The
    spell provides a substantial increase to mana regeneration and spell power, making
    it essential for maintaining sustained magical output in both PvE and PvP environments.
    The method does not require any parameters as it operates on the AI's current
    target or self.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "void MyMageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Cast Arcane Intellect when\
      \ appropriate\n    if (m_spellCooldown < diff)\n    {\n        CastArcaneIntellect();\n\
      \        m_spellCooldown = 10000; // 10 second cooldown\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the AI's spell casting system and may check
    for spell availability, target validity, and line of sight before attempting to
    cast. It is expected to be called within the context of an AI update loop where
    spell decisions are made based on combat state and resource management.
