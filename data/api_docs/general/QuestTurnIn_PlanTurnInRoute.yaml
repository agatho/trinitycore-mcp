api:
  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: PlanTurnInRoute
  signature: int QuestTurnIn::PlanTurnInRoute(Player * bot, const int & questGiverGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Plans the optimal turn-in route for a quest giver based on the bot's current
    location and quest requirements.
  description: The PlanTurnInRoute method calculates and determines the most efficient
    path for a player bot to travel to a quest giver in order to complete a specific
    quest. This method evaluates available quest givers, their locations, and the
    bot's current position to compute an optimal route. It considers factors such
    as distance, movement costs, and potential obstacles or restrictions within the
    game world. The method is typically invoked when a bot needs to determine where
    to travel next in order to turn in a quest, ensuring that the bot follows a logical
    progression through its questing behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will execute
      the turn-in route. Must be a valid player instance with initialized quest data.
  - name: questGiverGuids
    description: Reference to an integer value representing the GUID of the quest
      giver. This identifies which specific quest giver the bot should travel to for
      completing the quest.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the success or failure status of route planning.
    A return value of 0 typically indicates successful route calculation, while non-zero
    values may represent errors such as invalid GUIDs, unreachable locations, or pathfinding
    failures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int result = questTurnIn.PlanTurnInRoute(bot, questGiverGuid);\nif (result\
      \ == 0) {\n    // Proceed with executing the turn-in route\n    bot->MoveTo(questGiverPosition);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Error Handling Example
    code: "int result = questTurnIn.PlanTurnInRoute(bot, invalidQuestGiverGuid);\n\
      if (result != 0) {\n    // Handle error - perhaps log or notify user\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Failed to plan turn-in route for quest giver with GUID %u\", invalidQuestGiverGuid);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the bot's current position and the state of
    the quest giver within the game world. It may perform pathfinding calculations
    that could impact performance if called frequently without caching results. The
    method assumes that the player bot has valid quest data loaded and that the quest
    giver GUID corresponds to an existing entity in the world.
  warnings: The method may fail silently or return unexpected values if the provided
    quest giver GUID does not correspond to a valid quest giver in the game world.
    It is important to validate the GUID before calling this method. Additionally,
    frequent calls to this method without proper caching may lead to performance degradation
    due to repeated pathfinding computations.
