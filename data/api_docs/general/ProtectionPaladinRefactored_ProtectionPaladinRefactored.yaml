  class: ProtectionPaladinRefactored
  method: ProtectionPaladinRefactored
  signature: void ProtectionPaladinRefactored::ProtectionPaladinRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Protection Paladin AI bot with the specified player context.
  description: The ProtectionPaladinRefactored constructor initializes a Protection
    Paladin AI bot by setting up its internal state and player reference. This method
    prepares the bot for gameplay by configuring its behavior, abilities, and decision-making
    logic specific to the Protection Paladin class. It ensures that all necessary
    data structures are initialized and that the bot can properly interact with the
    game world and other entities. The method requires a valid Player pointer to associate
    the AI bot with an actual player character in the game.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the Protection Paladin
      AI bot that will be initialized. This parameter must not be null and should
      point to a valid player instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of Protection Paladin Bot
    code: 'Player* myPaladin = new Player();

      // ... initialize player ...

      ProtectionPaladinRefactored paladinAI(myPaladin);

      // The bot is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs initialization of various AI subsystems
    including ability management, target selection logic, and threat handling. It
    may also set up internal data structures like spell queues or cooldown tracking
    systems specific to Protection Paladins.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this constructor. Passing a null pointer will likely result in
    undefined behavior or crashes.
