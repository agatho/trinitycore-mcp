  class: RiptideTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void RiptideTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Riptide tracker state for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in the RiptideTracker class is responsible for refreshing
    or recalculating the state of the Riptide spell tracking mechanism for a given
    player bot. This typically involves checking the current status of the Riptide
    buff on the player, updating internal timers or counters, and potentially triggering
    any associated AI behaviors or actions based on the updated state. The method
    operates within the context of a bot's AI system where it may be called periodically
    to maintain accurate tracking of spell effects that influence gameplay decisions.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose Riptide
      tracker state needs to be updated. This parameter must not be null and should
      reference a valid player instance in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'RiptideTracker tracker;

      Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player

      tracker.Update(myBot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely invoked by the AI system during regular update cycles.
    It may perform checks against spell cooldowns, duration timers, and buff status
    to ensure accurate tracking of Riptide effects.
