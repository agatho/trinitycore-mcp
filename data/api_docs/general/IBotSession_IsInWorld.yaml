documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot session is currently active in the game world.
  description: The IsInWorld method determines if a bot session has successfully logged
    into and is actively present within the World of Warcraft game world. This method
    is typically used to verify that a bot's character is properly connected and can
    interact with game objects, NPCs, and other players. It returns true when the
    session is fully initialized and in-world, and false if the bot is still logging
    in, disconnected, or has been removed from the world. The check is essential for
    ensuring that commands and actions are only executed when the bot is capable of
    performing them within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot session is currently active and in the game world;
    otherwise returns false if the session is not yet initialized, disconnected, or
    has been removed from the world.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check bot status
    code: "if (botSession->IsInWorld()) {\n    // Bot is in world, safe to perform\
      \ actions\n    botSession->MoveTo(123.45f, 678.90f);\n} else {\n    // Bot not\
      \ yet in world or disconnected\n    Log(\"Bot not ready for actions\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically performs a lightweight check against internal session
    state flags rather than making network calls. It's recommended to use this method
    before executing any game-world dependent operations to prevent errors or undefined
    behavior.
