documentation:
  brief: Updates the evoker's buff states and applies appropriate spell effects based
    on current game conditions.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and updating all
    active buffs and auras on an Evoker AI character. This method evaluates the current
    state of the evoker, including health, mana, combat status, and available spells,
    to determine which buffs should be applied or maintained. It ensures that the
    evoker maintains optimal performance during encounters by dynamically adjusting
    its buff configuration in real-time. The method typically runs as part of the
    AI's periodic update cycle and interacts with the core TrinityCore spell system
    to apply or remove buffs.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void EvokerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    UpdateBuffs();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called regularly as part of the AI update loop and should
    not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom behavior. The
    implementation relies on internal state tracking and may have performance implications
    if called too frequently outside of the standard update cycle.
