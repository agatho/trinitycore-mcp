documentation:
  brief: Called when a creature enters combat mode, allowing custom AI behavior to
    be executed.
  description: The JustEnteredCombat method is a virtual callback function in the
    CreatureAI class that is invoked whenever a creature transitions into combat state.
    This method provides an opportunity for custom AI logic to be executed immediately
    upon entering combat, such as initiating specific abilities, playing sounds, or
    triggering events. The method is part of the core AI framework in TrinityCore
    and is typically overridden by custom AI implementations to provide unique behaviors
    for different creature types. It's important to note that this method may be called
    multiple times during a creature's lifetime if it leaves and re-enters combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override Implementation
    code: "class MyCustomCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void JustEnteredCombat(int*\
      \ param0) override {\n        // Play a custom sound when entering combat\n\
      \        me->PlayDirectSound(12345);\n        \n        // Cast a spell immediately\
      \ upon entering combat\n        DoCast(me, SPELL_CHARGE);\n        \n      \
      \  // Log the event\n        sLog->outString(\"Creature %u entered combat!\"\
      , me->GetEntry());\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called after the creature's combat state has been fully initialized.
    It's important to note that param0 in the signature appears to be an unused parameter
    in standard implementations, though it may be used in specific custom AI modules
    or for future expansion. The method should not block execution as it's called
    from the main game loop.
  warnings: Do not call SetInCombatWith() or similar combat-related functions within
    this method, as it can lead to infinite recursion or unexpected behavior. Avoid
    heavy computations in this method to prevent performance degradation during combat
    transitions.
