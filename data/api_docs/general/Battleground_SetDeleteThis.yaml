documentation:
  brief: Marks the battleground instance for deletion, scheduling it to be removed
    from active gameplay.
  description: The SetDeleteThis method is used to signal that a battleground instance
    should be deleted and removed from active gameplay. This method typically sets
    an internal flag or marker that indicates the battleground is no longer needed
    and can be safely destroyed. It's commonly called during battleground cleanup
    processes, such as when a battleground ends or when it needs to be reset for reuse.
    The actual deletion may not occur immediately but is scheduled for the next appropriate
    cleanup cycle. This method is part of the battleground lifecycle management system
    in TrinityCore.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Battleground Cleanup
    code: "void Battleground::HandleBattlegroundEnd()\n{\n    // ... cleanup logic\
      \ ...\n    SetDeleteThis();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage During Battleground Reset
    code: "void Battleground::Reset()\n{\n    // ... reset logic ...\n    if (IsFinished())\n\
      \    {\n        SetDeleteThis();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately destroy the battleground object. Instead,
    it marks it for deletion which will be processed at a later time by the game's
    cleanup system. The actual destruction happens asynchronously to avoid potential
    issues with ongoing gameplay loops or references.
  warnings: Calling this method directly without proper context may lead to undefined
    behavior if other systems are still referencing the battleground. Always ensure
    that all references are cleared before calling this method.
