documentation:
  brief: Resets the death recovery manager's internal state and clears all pending
    death-related data.
  description: The Reset method initializes or reinitializes the DeathRecoveryManager's
    internal state by clearing any existing death-related data, resetting counters,
    and preparing the manager for a fresh session. This method is typically invoked
    during player logout, character creation, or when transitioning between different
    game states where previous death recovery data should be discarded. It ensures
    that no stale or invalid recovery information persists in memory, maintaining
    the integrity of the death recovery system.

  - title: Basic Reset Usage
    code: 'DeathRecoveryManager* manager = sObjectAccessor->GetDeathRecoveryManager();

      manager->Reset();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may invalidate any pending death
    recovery operations. It is recommended to call Reset only when the player is not
    in a state where death recovery could occur, such as during logout or character
    selection.
