  class: GuildIntegration
  method: CacheGuildData
  signature: void GuildIntegration::CacheGuildData(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Caches guild data for the specified guild ID to improve performance of subsequent
    lookups.
  description: The CacheGuildData method retrieves and stores guild information in
    memory for a given guild identifier. This caching mechanism helps reduce database
    queries when accessing frequently requested guild details such as guild name,
    leader, members, and other related data. The method is typically invoked during
    guild initialization or when guild data is first needed. It ensures that subsequent
    requests for the same guild do not require repeated database access, thereby improving
    overall performance of guild-related operations within the TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: guildId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild to cache data for. Must be a valid
      guild ID that exists in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildInt;

      guildInt.CacheGuildData(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Caching Multiple Guilds
    code: "GuildIntegration guildInt;\nstd::vector<uint32> guildIds = {1001, 1002,\
      \ 1003};\nfor (uint32 id : guildIds)\n{\n    guildInt.CacheGuildData(id);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause race conditions
    when called from multiple threads. The cached data may become stale if the underlying
    guild information changes in the database; however, TrinityCore typically handles
    cache invalidation automatically during updates.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent guild ID may result
    in undefined behavior or failed lookups. Ensure that the guild ID is validated
    before calling this method to avoid potential errors.
