  class: LootTemplate
  method: AddEntry
  signature: void LootTemplate::AddEntry(LootStoreItem * item)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a loot item entry to the loot template, enabling it to be considered
    during loot distribution.
  description: The AddEntry method inserts a LootStoreItem into the internal list
    of loot entries within a LootTemplate. This allows the item to be evaluated and
    potentially awarded to players or NPCs when loot is generated according to the
    template's rules. The method typically operates on a loot template that defines
    which items can be dropped by specific creatures, game objects, or quests. It
    is commonly used during server initialization or dynamic loot template modifications.
    The entry is added to the template's collection without any validation of item
    uniqueness or conflict with existing entries.
  parameters:
  - name: item
    description: Pointer to a LootStoreItem object that represents the loot entry
      to be added. This item must be properly initialized with valid data such as
      item ID, chance, and other loot properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Basic Loot Entry
    code: 'LootStoreItem* newItem = new LootStoreItem();

      newItem->itemid = 12345;

      newItem-> chance = 10.0f;

      lootTemplate->AddEntry(newItem);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Entries to a Template
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n    LootStoreItem* entry = new LootStoreItem();\n\
      \    entry->itemid = 10000 + i;\n    entry->chance = 5.0f + i * 0.5f;\n    lootTemplate->AddEntry(entry);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any checks for duplicate entries or enforce
    item limits within the template. It simply appends the provided entry to the internal
    list. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the LootStoreItem is valid and
    properly initialized before calling AddEntry.
  warnings: Calling AddEntry with a null pointer will likely result in a crash or
    undefined behavior. Always validate the input item pointer before invoking this
    method. Additionally, adding entries after loot generation has started may lead
    to inconsistent loot results if not handled carefully.
