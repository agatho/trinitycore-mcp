documentation:
  brief: Loads database patterns for bot scheduling functionality
  description: The LoadDatabasePatterns method initializes and retrieves scheduling
    patterns from the database for use by the BotScheduler. This method is responsible
    for fetching predefined bot behavior schedules, including timing configurations,
    activity cycles, and priority settings that determine when and how bots should
    perform various actions within the game world. The loaded patterns are typically
    used to govern automated bot behaviors such as quest completion, resource gathering,
    or combat routines based on configured time-based triggers.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotScheduler scheduler;

      scheduler.LoadDatabasePatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should typically be called during server initialization or when
    the scheduler needs to refresh its pattern definitions from the database. The
    patterns are cached in memory after loading for performance reasons, so subsequent
    calls will not re-query the database unless explicitly required.
