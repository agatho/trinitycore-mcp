  method: ShouldUseAscendance
  signature: bool ShamanAI::ShouldUseAscendance() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the Shaman AI should use the Ascendance ability based
    on current combat conditions and resource state.
  description: The ShouldUseAscendance method evaluates various factors such as available
    mana, current target threat level, and the presence of specific buffs or debuffs
    to decide if using the Ascendance ability would be beneficial for the shaman.
    This method is typically called during the AI's decision-making process in combat
    situations. It considers the shaman's current resource pool, the effectiveness
    of other abilities in the current scenario, and the overall tactical situation
    to make an informed decision about when to activate Ascendance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Shaman AI determines that using Ascendance would be
    advantageous in the current combat state; otherwise returns false. The decision
    is based on resource availability, target conditions, and strategic gameplay factors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (shamanAI->ShouldUseAscendance()) {\n    shamanAI->DoCast(SPELL_ASCENDANCE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Shaman AI's strategic decision-making system and
    should only be called during active combat scenarios. The implementation may vary
    based on the specific shaman specialization (Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration)
    as each has different Ascendance mechanics.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of combat situations as it might return
    incorrect values due to missing context about current threat levels and target
    conditions. The method assumes that the shaman is in a valid combat state with
    an active target.
