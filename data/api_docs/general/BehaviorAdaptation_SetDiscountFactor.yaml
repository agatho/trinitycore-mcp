  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::SetDiscountFactor(float factor)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the discount factor used in behavior adaptation calculations for AI
    decision making.
  description: The SetDiscountFactor method configures the discount factor parameter
    that influences how future rewards are valued in the behavior adaptation system.
    This factor determines the importance of immediate versus delayed rewards when
    calculating optimal actions. The discount factor is typically a value between
    0 and 1, where values closer to 1 emphasize long-term rewards while values closer
    to 0 prioritize immediate rewards. This method is commonly used in reinforcement
    learning-based AI systems within TrinityCore's NPC behavior management to adjust
    how creatures weigh future consequences of their actions.
  parameters:
  - name: factor
    description: The discount factor value to set, typically between 0.0 and 1.0.
      A value of 1.0 means all future rewards are valued equally to immediate rewards,
      while a value of 0.0 means only immediate rewards are considered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Discount Factor for Long-term Strategy
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = creature->GetBehaviorAdaptation();

      behavior->SetDiscountFactor(0.95f); // Emphasize long-term rewards'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Discount Factor for Immediate Response
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation* behavior = creature->GetBehaviorAdaptation();

      behavior->SetDiscountFactor(0.3f); // Prioritize immediate rewards'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the reinforcement learning algorithm used in
    NPC behavior adaptation. The discount factor should be set before the AI begins
    making decisions to ensure consistent behavior calculation. Values outside the
    [0,1] range may produce unexpected results or cause numerical instability in the
    adaptation process.
  warnings: Setting the discount factor to values outside the typical [0,1] range
    can lead to unpredictable AI behavior and potential numerical overflow/underflow
    conditions. Always validate input values before calling this method.
