  class: GuardianIronfurTracker
  method: GetTimeRemaining
  signature: uint32 GuardianIronfurTracker::GetTimeRemaining() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the remaining time in milliseconds for the Ironfur guardian ability.
  description: The GetTimeRemaining method retrieves the duration left on the Ironfur
    buff that is applied to a guardian creature. This value represents how much time
    remains before the effect expires. The returned value is typically used by the
    AI system to determine when to reapply or manage the ability. The method does
    not modify any internal state and is safe for repeated calls during gameplay.
    It assumes that the guardian has an active Ironfur effect, otherwise it may return
    zero or an unexpected value.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the time remaining in milliseconds for the
    Ironfur ability. If no Ironfur effect is active, this value will typically be
    zero.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Ironfur is about to expire
    code: "if (guardian->GetAI()->GetTimeRemaining() < 5000)\n{\n    // Ironfur will\
      \ expire in less than 5 seconds\n    // Reapply or take action\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Use time remaining to decide AI behavior
    code: "uint32 timeLeft = guardian->GetAI()->GetTimeRemaining();\nif (timeLeft\
      \ > 10000)\n{\n    // Continue with current behavior\n}\nelse if (timeLeft >\
      \ 5000)\n{\n    // Prepare to reapply Ironfur\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Immediate\
      \ reapplication needed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Guardian AI system and relies on internal tracking
    of the Ironfur buff duration. It should only be called when the guardian actually
    has an active Ironfur effect to avoid misleading return values.
  warnings: Calling this method on a guardian without an active Ironfur effect may
    return unexpected or zero values. Always verify that the ability is active before
    relying on this value for gameplay logic.
