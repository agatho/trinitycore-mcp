documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with a character customization requirement
    entry.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags that define various properties or conditions for a character customization
    requirement. These flags are typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore database to determine which customization options are available, required,
    or restricted for players based on their account status, expansion level, or other
    game mechanics. The returned value can be evaluated using bitwise operations to
    check specific flag states.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with this character
    customization requirement entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific
    flag that defines the behavior or constraints of the customization option.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a flag is set
    code: "ChrCustomizationReqEntry* entry = sChrCustomizationReqStore.LookupEntry(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & 0x01) //\
      \ Check if flag 1 is set\n    {\n        // Customization is available for all\
      \ players\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using flags to determine customization availability
    code: "ChrCustomizationReqEntry* entry = sChrCustomizationReqStore.LookupEntry(67890);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if ((flags & 0x02) ==\
      \ 0)\n    {\n        // Customization requires expansion\n        // Handle\
      \ accordingly in your logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in the game's database
    and may vary between different versions of TrinityCore or World of Warcraft. Developers
    should consult the relevant database schema or documentation to understand the
    meaning of each bit within the returned integer.
