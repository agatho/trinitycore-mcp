  class: TargetManager
  method: GetPriorityTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetManager::GetPriorityTarget()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current priority target unit for this target manager instance.
  description: The GetPriorityTarget method retrieves the Unit object that is currently
    designated as the priority target within the TargetManager. This target is typically
    used by AI systems to determine which enemy or ally should be prioritized for
    actions such as attacks, spells, or other behaviors. The returned Unit pointer
    may be null if no priority target has been set or if the target has been removed
    from the game world. This method does not modify any internal state and is generally
    used for read-only access to the current target selection.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Unit object representing the priority target, or nullptr
    if no priority target exists or the target is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Unit* target = targetManager->GetPriorityTarget();\nif (target)\n{\n  \
      \  // Perform action on the priority target\n    DoSomethingWithTarget(target);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // No priority target available\n    HandleNoTarget();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making
    code: "Unit* priorityTarget = targetManager->GetPriorityTarget();\nif (priorityTarget\
      \ && priorityTarget->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Cast spell on priority target\n \
      \   caster->CastSpell(priorityTarget, SPELL_ID, true);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Find\
      \ new target if current one is invalid\n    Unit* newTarget = targetManager->GetNextTarget();\n\
      \    targetManager->SetPriorityTarget(newTarget);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the returned Unit pointer
    beyond checking for null. It is the caller's responsibility to verify that the
    returned Unit is still valid and alive before using it in operations. The method
    assumes that the target manager maintains a consistent internal state of the priority
    target.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned Unit pointer directly without verifying
    its validity. If the target has been removed from the world or is no longer valid,
    dereferencing the pointer may cause undefined behavior. Always check for null
    and ensure the target is alive before performing operations on it.
