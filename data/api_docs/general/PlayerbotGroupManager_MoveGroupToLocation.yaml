  class: PlayerbotGroupManager
  method: MoveGroupToLocation
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupManager::MoveGroupToLocation(uint32 groupId, const
    int & destination)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a player bot group to the specified destination location.
  description: The MoveGroupToLocation method is responsible for relocating an entire
    player bot group to a designated destination within the game world. This functionality
    is typically used in automated bot management systems where groups of bots need
    to be repositioned dynamically based on strategic requirements or gameplay conditions.
    The method operates on a group identifier and a destination parameter, ensuring
    that all members of the specified group are moved together to maintain group cohesion.
    It's commonly utilized in player bot AI systems to manage group positioning during
    quests, combat scenarios, or exploration activities.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier of the player bot group to be moved. This value
      must correspond to an existing group within the PlayerbotGroupManager system.
  - name: destination
    description: Reference to the destination location for the group. The exact type
      and format of this parameter should align with the internal coordinate or location
      system used by TrinityCore's bot management framework.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Move Group to Specific Location
    code: 'PlayerbotGroupManager* groupMgr = sPlayerbotAIConfig->GetGroupManager();

      uint32 groupId = 12345;

      int destination = 67890;

      groupMgr->MoveGroupToLocation(groupId, destination);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers internal pathfinding calculations to move the
    group smoothly through the game world. The destination parameter may be interpreted
    as a waypoint ID, coordinate pair, or other location identifier depending on the
    implementation details of the bot AI system.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupId corresponds to an active and valid player bot
    group before calling this method. Attempting to move a non-existent group may
    result in undefined behavior or errors within the bot management system.
