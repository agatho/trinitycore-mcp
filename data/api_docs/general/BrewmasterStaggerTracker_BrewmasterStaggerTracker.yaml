documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BrewmasterStaggerTracker instance to manage stagger effects
    for Brewmaster monks.
  description: The BrewmasterStaggerTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the stagger tracker, which is responsible for managing the stagger damage mechanics
    specific to the Brewmaster monk class in World of Warcraft. This tracker monitors
    and handles the accumulation, mitigation, and dissipation of stagger damage that
    occurs when a Brewmaster takes damage while under the effects of certain abilities
    like Keg Smash or other damage-over-time effects. The constructor sets up internal
    tracking variables and initializes the necessary state for the stagger system
    to function correctly within the game's combat mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new BrewmasterStaggerTracker instance
    code: 'BrewmasterStaggerTracker* tracker = new BrewmasterStaggerTracker();

      // The tracker is now initialized and ready to track stagger effects

      // for a Brewmaster monk character'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called during the initialization phase of
    a Brewmaster monk's combat state. The tracker relies on proper integration with
    the player's spell and damage systems to accurately track stagger accumulation
    and mitigation.
  warnings: Do not instantiate this tracker without ensuring that the associated player
    object has been properly initialized with Brewmaster class data. Improper instantiation
    may lead to undefined behavior when attempting to access stagger-related methods.
