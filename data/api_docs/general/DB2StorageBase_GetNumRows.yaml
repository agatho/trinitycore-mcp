  method: GetNumRows
  signature: uint32 DB2StorageBase::GetNumRows() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of rows currently loaded in the DB2 storage container.
  description: The GetNumRows method retrieves the count of all valid data rows currently
    stored within a DB2StorageBase instance. This method is commonly used to determine
    the size of loaded database table representations, such as item templates, creature
    entries, or other game-related data structures that are loaded from DBC/DB2 files.
    The returned value reflects the actual number of entries that can be accessed
    through the storage container and does not include any placeholder or invalid
    entries. This method is typically called during initialization phases or when
    iterating over all available records in a DB2 file.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of valid rows currently loaded
    in the DB2 storage container. Returns 0 if no data has been loaded or if the storage
    is empty.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check loaded row count
    code: "uint32 itemCount = sItemStorage->GetNumRows();\nif (itemCount > 0)\n{\n\
      \    printf(\"Loaded %u items\\n\", itemCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterating through all rows using row count
    code: "uint32 numRows = sCreatureStorage->GetNumRows();\nfor (uint32 i = 0; i\
      \ < numRows; ++i)\n{\n    if (CreatureTemplate const* creature = sCreatureStorage->LookupEntry(i))\n\
      \    {\n        // Process each creature template\n        printf(\"Creature\
      \ ID: %u, Name: %s\\n\", creature->Entry, creature->Name.c_str());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a constant-time lookup of the row count and does not
    perform any expensive operations. It's safe to call from multiple threads if the
    underlying storage is properly synchronized. The returned value corresponds directly
    to the number of entries that can be accessed via LookupEntry() or similar methods.
  warnings: Be aware that calling this method on an uninitialized or unloaded DB2StorageBase
    instance may return 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not checked
    properly. Also, note that row indices are zero-based and sequential, so accessing
    rows beyond GetNumRows() - 1 will result in invalid memory access.
