  signature: void GroupCoordinator::~GroupCoordinator()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a GroupCoordinator instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The GroupCoordinator destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources allocated during the lifetime of a GroupCoordinator object. This
    includes releasing any memory, canceling pending operations, and ensuring that
    group-related data structures are properly deallocated. In the context of TrinityCore's
    World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor ensures that player groups, loot
    settings, and other group coordination data are correctly freed when the coordinator
    is no longer needed. The method should be called automatically by the C++ runtime
    when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of GroupCoordinator
    code: 'GroupCoordinator* coordinator = new GroupCoordinator();

      // ... use coordinator ...

      delete coordinator; // Triggers ~GroupCoordinator()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a GroupCoordinator object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that all group
    members are properly notified of the coordinator's destruction to prevent dangling
    references or invalid group states.
