  class: HealerPositionStrategy
  method: EvaluatePositionScore
  signature: float HealerPositionStrategy::EvaluatePositionScore(const int & pos,
    Player * bot, Unit * target) const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns a positional score for a healer bot based on target
    proximity and healing requirements.
  description: The EvaluatePositionScore method calculates a numerical score representing
    how suitable a given position is for a healer bot to effectively support its target.
    This score takes into account factors such as distance to the target, line of
    sight, and potential threat levels. The method is typically used by AI decision-making
    systems within TrinityCore's healer behavior strategies to determine optimal positioning
    during combat or group scenarios. It serves as a core component in pathfinding
    and positioning logic for healer bots.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position index or identifier being evaluated. This typically
      corresponds to a specific location within the bot's navigation mesh or grid
      system.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the healer bot whose positioning
      is being evaluated.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that the healer bot is targeting or attempting
      to heal. This may be a player, NPC, or other unit in the game world.
  returns: A float value representing the calculated positional score. Higher scores
    indicate more favorable positions for the healer bot, while lower scores suggest
    less optimal locations. Scores are typically normalized between 0.0 and 1.0, though
    values outside this range may occur depending on internal scoring logic.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in healer AI
    code: "float score = strategy.EvaluatePositionScore(5, bot, target);\nif (score\
      \ > 0.7f) {\n    // Move to position 5\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Finding best healing position among candidates
    code: "float bestScore = -1.0f;\nint bestPos = -1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < numPositions;\
      \ ++i) {\n    float score = strategy.EvaluatePositionScore(i, bot, target);\n\
      \    if (score > bestScore) {\n        bestScore = score;\n        bestPos =\
      \ i;\n    }\n}\n// Use bestPos for movement decision"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a strategic AI system and may be called frequently
    during combat. The scoring algorithm likely incorporates multiple factors including
    distance, threat level, and healing range. Developers should ensure that the bot's
    target and position data are valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: The method assumes valid pointers for bot and target parameters. Passing
    null or invalid pointers may lead to crashes or incorrect scoring results. Additionally,
    since this is a core AI evaluation function, performance is critical and should
    be optimized for real-time gameplay scenarios.
