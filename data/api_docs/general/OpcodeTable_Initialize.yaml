documentation:
  brief: Initializes the opcode table for handling network messages in the TrinityCore
    server.
  description: The Initialize method sets up the internal data structures required
    for processing incoming network packets from clients. It typically populates lookup
    tables or initializes mappings between opcode constants and their corresponding
    handler functions. This method is usually called during server startup to ensure
    all supported opcodes are properly registered before client connections are accepted.
    The initialization process may involve loading opcode definitions from configuration
    files, setting up thread-safe access mechanisms, and preparing internal buffers
    for packet processing.

    code: 'OpcodeTable opcodeTable;

      opcodeTable.Initialize();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Reinitialization
    may lead to undefined behavior or memory leaks. The method is typically thread-safe
    and designed to be called from the main server thread before any client connections
    are established.
