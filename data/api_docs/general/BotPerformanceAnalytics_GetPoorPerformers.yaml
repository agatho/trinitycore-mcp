  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GetPoorPerformers
  signature: std::vector<BotPerformanceProfile> BotPerformanceAnalytics::GetPoorPerformers(uint32_t
    count) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of bot performance profiles ranked as poor performers based
    on analytics data.
  description: The GetPoorPerformers method returns a vector containing bot performance
    profiles that have been identified as having suboptimal performance according
    to internal analytics criteria. This method is typically used for monitoring and
    debugging purposes within the TrinityCore framework, particularly in systems managing
    AI-controlled bots. The returned profiles are sorted or filtered based on predefined
    thresholds or metrics such as response time, task completion rate, or resource
    utilization. The method does not modify any internal state and is safe to call
    from multiple threads if the underlying data structures are properly synchronized.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<BotPerformanceProfile> containing the performance data of
    bots identified as poor performers. Each profile includes metrics such as bot
    ID, performance score, last updated timestamp, and other relevant analytics information.
    Returns an empty vector if no poor performers are detected or if the analytics
    system has not yet collected sufficient data.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Poor Performers
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<BotPerformanceProfile>\
      \ poorPerformers = analytics.GetPoorPerformers(5);\nfor (const auto& profile\
      \ : poorPerformers) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot ID: \" << profile.botId << \"\
      , Score: \" << profile.score << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that performance analytics data has been previously collected
    and processed. The exact criteria for determining 'poor performance' are implementation-specific
    and may be configurable via configuration files or runtime settings. For optimal
    performance, it's recommended to cache results when calling this method frequently.
  warnings: Calling this method without sufficient analytics data may return an empty
    vector, which could be mistaken for a system error. Ensure proper validation of
    returned data before processing. Also, if the analytics system is under heavy
    load or not initialized, unexpected behavior might occur.
