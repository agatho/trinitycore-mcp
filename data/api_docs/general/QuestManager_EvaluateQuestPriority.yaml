  signature: QuestPriority QuestManager::EvaluateQuestPriority(const Quest * quest)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates and returns the priority level of a given quest based on player
    context and quest properties.
  description: The EvaluateQuestPriority method determines the relative importance
    or urgency of a specific quest within the game's quest system. It analyzes various
    factors such as quest level, player level, quest flags, and other contextual elements
    to assign a priority value. This priority is used internally by the QuestManager
    to sort and display quests appropriately in the player's quest log, ensuring that
    higher-priority quests are presented first. The method does not modify any quest
    state or player data; it only performs read-only analysis of the provided quest
    object.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a QuestPriority enum value indicating the calculated priority level
    of the quest. Possible values may include LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or ULTRA, depending
    on how the internal logic weights the quest's attributes against the player's
    current state.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "const Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nQuestPriority\
      \ priority = player->GetQuestManager().EvaluateQuestPriority(quest);\nif (priority\
      \ == QuestPriority::HIGH)\n{\n    // Handle high-priority quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest log updates or when sorting
    quests for display. It relies on internal quest evaluation logic that may change
    with game updates or patches. The implementation uses cached data where possible
    to improve performance.
  warnings: Do not assume the returned priority value remains static; it can change
    based on player progression, quest completion status, or dynamic conditions in
    the game world. Avoid relying solely on priority for critical gameplay decisions
    without additional context checks.
