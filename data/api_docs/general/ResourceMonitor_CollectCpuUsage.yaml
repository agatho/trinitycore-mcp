documentation:
  brief: Collects and returns the current CPU usage percentage of the TrinityCore
    server process
  description: The CollectCpuUsage method retrieves the current CPU utilization of
    the running TrinityCore server instance. This method is typically used for monitoring
    system performance, identifying potential bottlenecks, or implementing dynamic
    resource management strategies. The returned value represents the percentage of
    CPU time consumed by the server process over a recent sampling period. This measurement
    can be crucial for administrators to ensure optimal server performance and to
    make informed decisions about scaling or optimization. The method may use platform-specific
    APIs to gather this information, such as Windows Performance Counters or Linux
    /proc filesystem entries.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the current CPU usage percentage of the TrinityCore
    process. Values typically range from 0.0 (no CPU usage) to 100.0 (full CPU utilization).
    The value may be rounded to a specific precision depending on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic CPU Usage Monitoring
    code: 'ResourceMonitor monitor;

      float cpuUsage = monitor.CollectCpuUsage();

      printf("Current CPU Usage: %.2f%%\n", cpuUsage);'
    language: cpp
  - title: CPU Usage Logging for Performance Analysis
    code: "ResourceMonitor monitor;\nwhile (true) {\n    float usage = monitor.CollectCpuUsage();\n\
      \    if (usage > 80.0f) {\n        sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_SERVER, \"High CPU\
      \ Usage Detected: %.2f%%\", usage);\n    }\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may have platform-specific implementation details and could involve
    system calls that might introduce minor overhead. The accuracy of the measurement
    depends on the sampling interval used by the underlying OS APIs. On some systems,
    the value might be smoothed over time rather than representing instantaneous usage.
  warnings: Repeated calls to this method in tight loops without proper throttling
    may impact performance due to system call overhead. The returned value is only
    as accurate as the underlying system monitoring capabilities and may not reflect
    true instantaneous CPU load in all scenarios.
