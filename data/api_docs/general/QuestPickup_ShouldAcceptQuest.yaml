  class: QuestPickup
  method: ShouldAcceptQuest
  signature: bool QuestPickup::ShouldAcceptQuest(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot player should accept a specified quest based on
    quest requirements and player state.
  description: The ShouldAcceptQuest method evaluates if a given quest can be accepted
    by a bot player. It checks various conditions such as quest prerequisites, player
    level, faction requirements, quest completion status, and other game-specific
    rules that govern quest acceptance. This method is typically used in AI systems
    or questing scripts to determine whether a bot should initiate or accept a quest.
    The evaluation considers the player's current state including their level, available
    quests, completed quests, and any quest gating conditions. It does not modify
    the player's quest state directly but returns a boolean value indicating whether
    acceptance is allowed.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to evaluate for acceptance. Must
      be a valid quest ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is attempting
      to accept the quest. The player must be valid and in a usable state.
  returns: Returns true if the bot can accept the quest, false otherwise. A return
    value of false typically indicates that the quest has already been completed,
    the player does not meet prerequisites, or other conditions prevent acceptance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Check
    code: "if (questPickup->ShouldAcceptQuest(12345, botPlayer)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance logic\n    botPlayer->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n \
      \   // Skip or handle quest rejection\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot cannot accept\
      \ quest 12345\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "void BotAI::ProcessQuestAcceptance() {\n    for (uint32 questId : availableQuests)\
      \ {\n        if (ShouldAcceptQuest(questId, bot)) {\n            // Accept the\
      \ quest\n            bot->PlayerTalkClass->SendQuestGiverQuestDetails(questId);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI questing system and may be called frequently
    during bot behavior updates. Ensure that both questId and bot are valid before
    calling to avoid undefined behavior. The method relies on internal quest data
    tables and player state checks, so performance can vary depending on how many
    quests are loaded or how complex the quest conditions are.
  warnings: Do not call this method with an invalid Player pointer or a non-existent
    quest ID as it may cause crashes or unexpected behavior. Also, note that this
    method only evaluates whether a quest can be accepted; it does not perform the
    actual acceptance action.
