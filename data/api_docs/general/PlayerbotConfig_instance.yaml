documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PlayerbotConfig class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PlayerbotConfig
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the configuration manager exists throughout
    the application lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global player
    bot configuration settings and parameters. The returned pointer provides access
    to all configuration values and methods related to player bot behavior, AI decision-making,
    and gameplay parameters. This implementation is thread-safe and designed for use
    in multi-threaded environments typical of TrinityCore's architecture.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single PlayerbotConfig instance. The method never returns
    NULL as it creates the instance on first call if it doesn't exist yet.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Playerbot Configuration
    code: 'PlayerbotConfig* config = PlayerbotConfig::instance();

      bool enableBots = config->GetValue<bool>("EnableBots");

      int maxBotCount = config->GetValue<int>("MaxBotCount");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Configuration in Bot AI Logic
    code: "PlayerbotConfig* cfg = PlayerbotConfig::instance();\nif (cfg->GetValue<bool>(\"\
      BotAIEnabled\")) {\n    // Enable bot AI behavior\n    bot->SetAI(new PlayerbotAI(bot));\n\
      } else {\n    // Disable bot functionality\n    bot->SetAI(nullptr);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the Meyers singleton pattern with a local static instance,
    which is thread-safe in C++11 and later. The configuration values are typically
    loaded from worldserver.conf or similar configuration files during server startup.
    The singleton instance is created lazily on first access.
  warnings: Avoid storing references to the singleton instance across different scopes
    as it may lead to issues with object lifetime management. Be cautious when modifying
    configuration values during runtime, as some settings might require server restart
    to take full effect.
