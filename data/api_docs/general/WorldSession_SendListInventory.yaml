api:
  class: WorldSession
  method: SendListInventory
  signature: void WorldSession::SendListInventory(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sends the inventory list of a specified player to the session's client.
  description: The SendListInventory method retrieves and transmits the complete inventory
    contents of a target player identified by their GUID to the connected client.
    This method is typically used when a player opens another player's inventory,
    such as during trading, inspecting, or looting scenarios. It constructs and sends
    an appropriate packet containing all inventory items, their quantities, and relevant
    metadata to ensure the client displays the inventory correctly. The method operates
    within the context of WorldSession and requires proper authentication and permissions
    to access another player's inventory data.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the target player whose inventory
      is to be sent. Must represent a valid online player character.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Send Inventory List of Target Player
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      uint32 targetGuid = 12345;

      session->SendListInventory(targetGuid);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes the target player is online and accessible. It may trigger
    additional checks for permissions or proximity depending on game mechanics. The
    actual inventory data is retrieved from the player's stored item containers.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or offline player GUID may result
    in undefined behavior or client-side errors. Ensure proper validation of the target
    player before invoking this function.
