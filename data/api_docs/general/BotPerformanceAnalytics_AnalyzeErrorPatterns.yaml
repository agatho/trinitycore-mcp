documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and logs error patterns from bot performance data to identify recurring
    issues.
  description: The AnalyzeErrorPatterns method processes collected performance metrics
    and error logs from bots within the TrinityCore environment. It identifies common
    failure points, repeated exceptions, or systemic problems in bot behavior. This
    analysis helps developers understand where bots are failing most frequently and
    aids in improving AI logic, pathfinding, or interaction handling. The method typically
    runs during periodic maintenance or after significant updates to the game mechanics.
    It does not require specific preconditions but assumes that performance data has
    been previously collected and stored.

    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.AnalyzeErrorPatterns();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally intensive if large volumes of performance
    data are present. It is recommended to run this analysis during low-traffic periods
    or as a background task to avoid impacting server performance.
