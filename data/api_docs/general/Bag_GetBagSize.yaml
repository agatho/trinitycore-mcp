  class: Bag
  method: GetBagSize
  signature: int Bag::GetBagSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of slots available in the bag.
  description: The GetBagSize method retrieves the total number of inventory slots
    that a specific bag can hold. This value determines how many items can be stored
    within the bag before it becomes full. The returned size is typically determined
    by the bag's item template and may vary based on the bag type (e.g., quivers,
    backpacks, etc.). This method is commonly used in inventory management systems
    to check capacity limits and determine if an item can be added to a bag.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the total number of slots available in the bag.
    Returns 0 for invalid bags or bags that have not been properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Check Bag Capacity Before Adding Item
    code: "if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindConnectedPlayer(playerGuid))\n\
      {\n    if (Bag* bag = dynamic_cast<Bag*>(player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0,\
      \ bagSlot)))\n    {\n        int bagSize = bag->GetBagSize();\n        int itemCount\
      \ = bag->GetItemCount();\n        if (itemCount < bagSize)\n        {\n    \
      \        // Item can be added to the bag\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses the internal slot count of the bag object and does not
    perform any calculations or lookups. It's a simple getter that returns pre-computed
    data stored in the bag's template or instance variables.
