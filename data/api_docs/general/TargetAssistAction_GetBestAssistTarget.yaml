  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: GetBestAssistTarget
  signature: Unit * TargetAssistAction::GetBestAssistTarget(Player * bot, Group *
    group) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the most suitable target for assist behavior within
    a group context.
  description: The GetBestAssistTarget method evaluates the current state of a player's
    group to identify the optimal unit to assist. It considers factors such as threat
    level, distance, target validity, and group dynamics to select the best candidate
    for support actions. This method is typically used by AI-controlled bots or players
    in group scenarios where coordinated assistance is required. The returned Unit
    pointer represents the selected target that should be prioritized for assistance,
    or NULL if no suitable target exists within the current context.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a Unit object representing the best assist target, or NULL
    if no valid target is found.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot AI
    code: "Unit* target = bot->GetPlayerbotAI()->GetBestAssistTarget(bot, bot->GetGroup());\n\
      if (target)\n{\n    // Perform assist action on the selected target\n    bot->Attack(target,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on internal AI logic and group management systems.
    It may return NULL if the player is not in a group or if all potential targets
    are invalid or out of range.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and group parameters are valid before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior. The returned Unit pointer should be checked
    for nullity before use.
