api:
  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestFlags
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestFlags(const Quest * quest, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a quest's flags are acceptable for the specified player
    bot.
  description: The ValidateQuestFlags method checks if a given quest's flags are compatible
    with the rules and restrictions defined for the player bot. This validation ensures
    that the quest can be properly accepted, completed, or interacted with by the
    bot without violating game mechanics or player restrictions. The method evaluates
    various flag combinations such as quest type, repeatable status, daily quests,
    and other quest-specific attributes against the bot's current state and allowed
    behaviors. It is typically used during quest acceptance or progression checks
    to prevent invalid quest interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object that needs to be validated. Must not
      be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will interact
      with the quest. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if all quest flags are valid for the bot; otherwise returns
    false. A return value of false indicates that the quest cannot be accepted or
    processed by the bot due to incompatible flag settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestFlags(quest, playerBot)) {\n    // Proceed\
      \ with quest acceptance\n    playerBot->AddQuest(quest);\n} else {\n    // Log\
      \ or handle invalid quest flags\n    sLog->outError(\"Invalid quest flags for\
      \ bot %s\", playerBot->GetName().c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Accept Logic
    code: "bool CanAcceptQuest(Player* player, Quest const* quest) {\n    if (!quest\
      \ || !player)\n        return false;\n    \n    // Validate quest flags before\
      \ accepting\n    if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestFlags(quest, player)) {\n\
      \        return true;\n    }\n    \n    // Optionally check additional conditions\n\
      \    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against bot-specific restrictions such
    as quest level limits, class requirements, faction restrictions, and other player-specific
    limitations. The validation may also consider the bot's current quest log to prevent
    duplicate or conflicting quests. Performance is generally low since it involves
    flag comparisons and potentially some conditional logic.
  warnings: Ensure that both quest and bot parameters are valid pointers before calling
    this method. Passing null pointers will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior.
    This method should not be used for general quest data retrieval; it's specifically
    designed for validation purposes.
