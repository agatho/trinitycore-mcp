documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new QuestEventBus instance for handling quest-related events.
  description: The QuestEventBus constructor initializes a new event bus specifically
    designed to manage and dispatch quest-related events within the TrinityCore framework.
    This class facilitates communication between various subsystems of the game engine,
    such as quest triggers, player interactions, and objective completions. It provides
    a centralized mechanism for registering event listeners and broadcasting notifications
    when specific quest conditions are met or actions occur. The initialization process
    sets up internal data structures required for efficient event handling and ensures
    thread safety where applicable.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new QuestEventBus instance
    code: 'QuestEventBus eventBus;

      // The eventBus is now ready to handle quest events'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or resource allocation.
    It simply sets up the basic internal state of the QuestEventBus object. The actual
    event handling capabilities are enabled through subsequent registration of event
    handlers and listeners.
