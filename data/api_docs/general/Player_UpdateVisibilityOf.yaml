  brief: Updates the visibility state of the player for targeted entities in the game
    world
  description: The UpdateVisibilityOf method recalculates and updates the visibility
    status of a player character for all nearby targets within the game world. This
    method is typically invoked when a player's state changes (such as stealth, invisibility,
    or movement) that could affect how other entities perceive them. It ensures that
    the player's visibility flags are properly synchronized with the game server's
    internal tracking systems, which in turn affects what objects are visible to the
    player and vice versa. The method operates on the principle of maintaining accurate
    spatial awareness and network synchronization between players and game entities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Movement
    code: "void Player::OnMove() {\n    // Update visibility when player moves\n \
      \   UpdateVisibilityOf(0);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Visibility Update After Stealth State Change
    code: "void Player::SetStealthState(bool stealthed) {\n    m_stealthed = stealthed;\n\
      \    // Force visibility update after changing stealth state\n    UpdateVisibilityOf(0);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method internally handles the recomputation of visibility flags and
    may trigger network updates to nearby players. It's commonly called during player
    state transitions such as entering/leaving stealth, changing zones, or moving
    between different visibility contexts. The method is performance-sensitive as
    it can trigger multiple network packets depending on the number of nearby entities.
  warnings: Invoking this method too frequently without proper throttling may cause
    excessive network traffic and performance degradation. It should only be called
    when actual visibility state changes occur rather than on every frame update.
