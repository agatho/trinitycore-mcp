  class: BotTalentManager
  method: LearnHeroTalent
  signature: bool BotTalentManager::LearnHeroTalent(Player * bot, uint32 heroTalentEntry)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to teach a bot player a hero talent from the specified talent entry.
  description: The LearnHeroTalent method is responsible for granting a bot player
    a specific hero talent based on the provided talent entry ID. This function typically
    checks if the bot meets the prerequisites for learning the talent, such as having
    sufficient skill points or completing required quests. It then applies the talent
    to the bot's talent tree and updates the player's data accordingly. The method
    is commonly used in automated bot behavior systems where bots need to dynamically
    improve their abilities during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will learn
      the hero talent. Must be a valid player instance.
  - name: heroTalentEntry
    description: The unique identifier (entry ID) of the hero talent to be learned.
      This corresponds to an entry in the game's talent database.
  returns: Returns true if the talent was successfully learned and applied to the
    bot, or false if the operation failed due to invalid parameters, missing prerequisites,
    or other errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this is a valid bot player\nuint32 talentId\
      \ = 12345;\nbool success = BotTalentManager::LearnHeroTalent(myBot, talentId);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Talent learned successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Bot learned hero talent %u\", talentId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to learn\
      \ talent\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to teach bot hero talent %u\", talentId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Precondition Check
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nuint32 talentEntry = 67890;\n\n// Validate the bot\
      \ is valid and not in combat\nif (!bot || bot->IsInCombat())\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"\
      Cannot learn talent: Bot invalid or in combat\");\n    return false;\n}\n\n\
      // Attempt to learn the talent\nbool result = BotTalentManager::LearnHeroTalent(bot,\
      \ talentEntry);\nif (result)\n{\n    // Notify player and update UI\n    bot->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      Hero Talent Learned!\");\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot %s learned hero talent %u\"\
      , bot->GetName().c_str(), talentEntry);\n}\nelse\n{\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed\
      \ to learn hero talent %u for bot %s\", talentEntry, bot->GetName().c_str());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided bot player is already initialized and
    has access to the necessary talent trees. The function may perform internal checks
    for prerequisites like level requirements or existing talent points. It is recommended
    to call this method only when the bot is not in combat to avoid potential synchronization
    issues.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid Player pointer or a non-existent talent
    entry ID will likely result in undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate
    inputs before calling this function. Additionally, ensure that bots are not being
    modified during active combat or critical game events.
