  class: DeathKnightBaselineRotation
  method: ApplyBuffs
  signature: void DeathKnightBaselineRotation::ApplyBuffs(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Applies necessary buffs and enhancements to the Death Knight bot before initiating
    combat rotation.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for preparing a Death Knight bot
    by applying essential buffs, consumables, and enhancements required for optimal
    performance during combat. This method typically checks the current state of the
    bot, evaluates available resources such as runes, energy, or mana, and applies
    appropriate abilities or items that improve the bot's effectiveness in battle.
    It ensures that all necessary prerequisites are met before entering into the main
    rotation logic, including buffs from talents, equipment bonuses, and temporary
    enhancements from consumables or potions. The method is generally called at the
    beginning of a combat sequence or when the bot needs to be refreshed for continued
    optimal performance.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or index
      within the system. Used to access and modify the specific bot instance's state
      and properties.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int botId = 1;

      DeathKnightBaselineRotation rotation;

      rotation.ApplyBuffs(&botId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat Loop
    code: "void DeathKnightBot::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    int botId = this->GetBotId();\n\
      \    ApplyBuffs(&botId);\n    // Proceed to main combat rotation\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be invoked before starting any combat-related actions
    to ensure the bot is properly equipped and buffed. It may internally call other
    methods such as CheckRuneAvailability(), ApplyConsumables(), or ActivateTalents()
    depending on the current state of the Death Knight.
  warnings: Improper handling of the bot parameter can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect application of buffs. Ensure that the pointer passed is valid and
    points to an initialized bot instance.
