  class: Channel
  method: IsOn
  signature: bool Channel::IsOn(int who) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether a player is currently connected to the channel.
  description: The IsOn method determines if a specific player, identified by their
    unique identifier (who), is currently a member of the channel. This method is
    commonly used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to verify
    channel membership before allowing actions such as sending messages or performing
    channel-specific operations. The method performs a lookup within the internal
    channel member list to confirm the player's presence.
  parameters:
  - name: who
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player to check for membership
      in the channel.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player is currently a member of the channel,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player is on Channel
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel\
      \ && channel->IsOn(player->GetGUID().GetCounter())) {\n    // Player is on the\
      \ channel\n    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"You are currently\
      \ in the General channel.\");\n} else {\n    // Player is not on the channel\n\
      \    ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).SendSysMessage(\"You are not in the General\
      \ channel.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a linear search through the internal list of channel
    members, so performance may degrade with large numbers of players in a channel.
    It is recommended to cache results when checking membership frequently.
