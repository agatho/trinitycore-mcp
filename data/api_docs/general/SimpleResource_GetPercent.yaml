  method: GetPercent
  signature: float SimpleResource::GetPercent() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the percentage value of the current resource relative
    to its maximum value.
  description: The GetPercent method computes the proportional percentage of the current
    resource amount compared to its maximum possible value. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft client UI elements to display health, mana, or other resource
    bars as a percentage. The calculation typically involves dividing the current
    resource value by the maximum resource value and multiplying by 100. The method
    is designed to be efficient and safe for frequent calls during gameplay updates.
    It assumes that the maximum resource value is greater than zero to avoid division
    by zero errors.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the percentage of the current resource relative
    to its maximum value. For example, if a character has 50 health out of 100 maximum
    health, this method would return 50.0f. If the maximum value is zero, the behavior
    may vary depending on implementation but typically returns 0.0f or throws an exception.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage for Health Percentage
    code: 'float healthPercent = player->GetResource()->GetPercent();

      // Returns 75.0f if player has 75% of maximum health'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Percentage in UI Updates
    code: "if (player->GetResource()->GetPercent() < 20.0f)\n{\n    // Trigger low\
      \ health warning\n    SendLowHealthWarning(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with resource management systems
    and UI rendering components. It's important to note that the returned percentage
    may be rounded or clamped depending on how it's consumed by the client. The method
    should not be called during critical sections of code where performance is paramount
    due to potential floating-point operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the maximum resource value is valid (not zero) before calling
    this method to avoid unexpected behavior. In some edge cases, particularly with
    very small resource values, floating-point precision might cause minor inaccuracies
    in percentage calculations.
