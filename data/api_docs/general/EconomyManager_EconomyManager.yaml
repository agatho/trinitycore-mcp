  class: EconomyManager
  method: EconomyManager
  signature: void EconomyManager::EconomyManager(Player * bot, BotAI * ai)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new EconomyManager instance with the specified player and AI
    context.
  description: The EconomyManager constructor initializes a new economy management
    system for a bot player within the TrinityCore framework. This method sets up
    internal references to both the Player object representing the bot and the BotAI
    object that controls its behavior. The initialization process likely configures
    various economy-related parameters, such as currency handling, item acquisition
    strategies, and resource allocation rules specific to the bot's role in the game
    world. This constructor is typically called during the creation or setup phase
    of a bot instance, ensuring that the economy system is properly integrated with
    the AI's decision-making processes.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will utilize
      this economy manager. This parameter must be a valid player instance and cannot
      be null.
  - name: ai
    description: Pointer to the BotAI object that controls the behavior of the bot.
      This AI component coordinates with the economy manager to make decisions about
      resource management, purchasing, and selling strategies.
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Basic EconomyManager Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Valid bot player instance

      BotAI* myAI = ...;     // Valid AI instance

      EconomyManager econManager(myBot, myAI);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Creation Process
    code: "void CreateBotWithEconomy(Player* player, BotAI* ai) {\n    EconomyManager*\
      \ econ = new EconomyManager(player, ai);\n    // Further initialization of bot\
      \ components\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the bot's initialization phase.
    The EconomyManager relies on both the Player and BotAI objects being valid throughout
    its lifetime. It's important to ensure that these objects are not destroyed before
    the EconomyManager instance, as this would lead to undefined behavior.
  warnings: Passing null pointers for either 'bot' or 'ai' parameters will likely
    result in crashes or undefined behavior. Always validate that both parameters
    are valid before calling this constructor.
