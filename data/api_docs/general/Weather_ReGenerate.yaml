  class: Weather
  method: ReGenerate
  signature: bool Weather::ReGenerate()
documentation:
  brief: Regenerates the weather state for a zone, updating all connected clients
    with new weather conditions.
  description: The ReGenerate method is responsible for recalculating and applying
    new weather conditions to a specific zone in the World of Warcraft environment.
    This function typically triggers when weather transitions occur or when environmental
    changes need to be synchronized across all players within that zone. It ensures
    that client-side weather effects are updated to match the current server state,
    including precipitation, temperature, and visual effects. The method may also
    handle cleanup of old weather data and initialization of new weather parameters
    based on configured thresholds or random generators.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the weather regeneration was successful and all clients
    were notified of the changes; returns false if the operation failed due to invalid
    zone state, missing weather data, or other internal errors during the regeneration
    process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Weather Regeneration
    code: "Weather* weather = sWorld->GetWeatherMap()->GetWeather(zoneId);\nif (weather)\n\
      {\n    bool success = weather->ReGenerate();\n    if (success)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      weather\", \"Weather regenerated successfully for zone %u\", zoneId);\n    else\n\
      \        TC_LOG_ERROR(\"weather\", \"Failed to regenerate weather for zone %u\"\
      , zoneId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when weather transitions are intended or
    when explicit updates are required. Frequent calls may cause performance overhead
    due to client synchronization. The regeneration process is typically thread-safe
    but depends on proper locking mechanisms within the WeatherManager system.
  warnings: Calling ReGenerate without proper zone validation might result in undefined
    behavior or client-side desynchronization. Ensure that the weather object is valid
    and that the zone has active players before invoking this method.
