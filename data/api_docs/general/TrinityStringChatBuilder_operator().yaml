  signature: ChatPacketSender * TrinityStringChatBuilder::operator()(LocaleConstant
    locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and returns a ChatPacketSender for the specified locale.
  description: The operator() method of TrinityStringChatBuilder is used to construct
    and return a ChatPacketSender instance configured for the given locale. This method
    is typically invoked when preparing localized chat messages for transmission to
    players in World of Warcraft. It ensures that the appropriate language-specific
    formatting and localization data are applied to the chat packet before sending.
    The returned ChatPacketSender can then be used to send the message to one or more
    recipients. This method does not modify the original TrinityStringChatBuilder
    instance, maintaining immutability.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a ChatPacketSender object configured for the specified locale.
    The caller is responsible for managing the lifetime of this object and should
    ensure it is properly deleted or handled according to the memory management strategy
    in use.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'TrinityStringChatBuilder builder;

      LocaleConstant locale = LOCALE_en;

      ChatPacketSender* sender = builder(locale);

      sender->Send();

      delete sender;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with Player Targeting
    code: 'TrinityStringChatBuilder builder;

      Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      ChatPacketSender* sender = builder(player->GetSession()->GetSessionLocale());

      sender->SetReceiver(player);

      sender->Send();

      delete sender;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's chat system localization framework.
    It is designed to be thread-safe for concurrent access, assuming that the underlying
    locale data structures are properly synchronized. The returned ChatPacketSender
    must be explicitly deleted by the caller unless managed by a smart pointer or
    similar mechanism.
  warnings: Ensure that the LocaleConstant passed to this method is valid and supported
    by the server configuration; passing an invalid locale may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect message formatting. Also, always delete the returned ChatPacketSender
    pointer after use to prevent memory leaks.
