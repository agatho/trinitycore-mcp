  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: SetCachingEnabled
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::SetCachingEnabled(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables caching for the group combat trigger.
  description: The SetCachingEnabled method controls whether the GroupCombatTrigger
    class caches its internal state or operations. When enabled, the trigger may store
    computed results or intermediate data to improve performance during frequent checks
    or updates. This is particularly useful in combat scenarios where the same conditions
    might be evaluated multiple times per tick. The caching behavior can be toggled
    at runtime to balance between performance gains and memory usage. Disabling caching
    ensures that all evaluations are performed fresh, which may be necessary for highly
    dynamic combat situations.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether caching should be enabled (true)
      or disabled (false). When true, the trigger will cache results to optimize repeated
      operations; when false, all operations will be performed fresh.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Caching
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      trigger.SetCachingEnabled(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Caching for Dynamic Combat
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger trigger;

      trigger.SetCachingEnabled(false);

      // Used in scenarios where combat state changes rapidly

      // and cached values could become stale'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the internal behavior of the GroupCombatTrigger without
    changing its public interface. Caching is typically beneficial for performance
    but may introduce latency if the cached data becomes invalid before being refreshed.
