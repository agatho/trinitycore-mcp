  class: Player
  method: SetContestedPvP
  signature: void Player::SetContestedPvP(Player * attackedPlayer)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the player's PvP state to contested, enabling PvP combat with the specified
    player.
  description: This method establishes a contested PvP relationship between the current
    player and the target attackedPlayer, allowing them to engage in PvP combat. It
    typically occurs when a player enters a PvP zone or when a player attacks another
    player who is already in PvP status. The method sets the player's PvP flag, which
    enables PvP mechanics such as damage calculation, loot drop, and death penalty.
    This action also triggers the player's PvP timer, indicating they are now in contested
    PvP status.
  parameters:
  - name: attackedPlayer
    description: A pointer to the Player object that is being attacked and will be
      set into contested PvP state. This parameter must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* targetPlayer = ObjectAccessor::GetPlayer(\"playerName\");\nif (targetPlayer)\n\
      {\n    player->SetContestedPvP(targetPlayer);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in PvP scenarios where players are actively
    attacking each other. The implementation involves setting the player's PvP flag
    and updating their PvP timer. It should only be called when both players are in
    a valid PvP state, such as in PvP zones or when one player has already initiated
    PvP.
  warnings: This method should not be used to set PvP status for non-player characters
    or in non-PvP zones. It also requires that the attackedPlayer is not null and
    that both players are in valid PvP status for proper functionality.
