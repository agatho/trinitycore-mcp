  class: OutdoorPvPMgr
  method: GetDefenseMessage
  signature: int OutdoorPvPMgr::GetDefenseMessage(int zoneId, int id, LocaleConstant
    locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the defense message ID for a specified zone and outdoor PvP objective.
  description: The GetDefenseMessage method retrieves the localized defense message
    identifier associated with a specific outdoor PvP zone and objective. This method
    is used internally by the OutdoorPvP system to determine which defensive message
    should be displayed to players when they interact with certain objectives or zones.
    The returned ID typically corresponds to a message in the game's localization
    system that informs players about the current state of defense for that particular
    area.
  parameters:
  - name: zoneId
    description: The unique identifier of the outdoor PvP zone where the objective
      is located. This value maps to a specific zone in the game world.
  - name: id
    description: The identifier of the specific outdoor PvP objective within the zone.
      Each objective within a zone has its own unique ID.
  - name: locale
    description: The locale constant specifying which language version of the message
      to retrieve. Valid values are defined in LocaleConstant enum.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the message ID for the defense message
    associated with the specified zone and objective. A return value of -1 typically
    indicates that no valid message was found for the given parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get defense message
    code: int messageId = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetDefenseMessage(1234, 5678, LOCALE_en);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using with dynamic zone and objective IDs
    code: "uint32 zoneId = player->GetZoneId();\nuint32 objectiveId = 1;\nint messageId\
      \ = sOutdoorPvPMgr->GetDefenseMessage(zoneId, objectiveId, player->GetSession()->GetSessionDbLocaleIndex());\n\
      if (messageId != -1)\n{\n    // Process the message ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the OutdoorPvP system and relies on internal data
    structures that map zone IDs to their respective defense messages. The method
    may return -1 if no matching message exists for the given parameters, which should
    be handled gracefully in calling code.
  warnings: Ensure that zoneId and id values are valid identifiers within the game's
    outdoor PvP system. Invalid parameters could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    message retrieval.
