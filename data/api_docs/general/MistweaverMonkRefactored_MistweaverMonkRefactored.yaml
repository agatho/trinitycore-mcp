documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Mistweaver Monk AI bot with the specified player reference.
  description: The MistweaverMonkRefactored constructor initializes a Mistweaver Monk
    AI bot by associating it with a Player object. This method sets up the bot's initial
    state, including its class-specific abilities, spell configurations, and behavior
    patterns tailored for the Mistweaver Monk specialization. The initialization process
    ensures that the bot can properly execute healing routines, manage mana efficiently,
    and respond to combat situations according to the Mistweaver Monk's gameplay mechanics.
    It is typically called when creating or spawning a new Mistweaver Monk AI instance
    within the TrinityCore environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* bot = new Player();

      MistweaverMonkRefactored monkBot(bot);

      // The monk bot is now initialized and ready for AI behavior'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor likely performs essential setup such as initializing spell
    cooldowns, setting up target selection logic, configuring healing priority systems,
    and preparing the bot's action queue. It assumes that the Player object passed
    in is valid and properly allocated within the TrinityCore framework.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this constructor is not null
    or invalid, as this could lead to undefined behavior or crashes during runtime.
    The constructor does not perform validation on the input player object.
