documentation:
  brief: Initializes language data for spell effects within the TrinityCore framework
  description: The LoadSpellEffectLanguage method is responsible for loading and initializing
    language-specific data associated with spell effects. This method processes the
    provided SpellEffectEntry to ensure that all relevant language information is
    properly registered and accessible for use in game mechanics such as spell descriptions,
    tooltips, and localized messages. It typically operates during server initialization
    or when spell data is dynamically loaded, ensuring that language localization
    is correctly applied to spell effects across different client locales. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal language manager state.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage During Server Startup
    code: "void InitializeSpellEffects()\n{\n    // Assume spellEffect is a valid\
      \ SpellEffectEntry pointer\n    LanguageMgr::Instance()->LoadSpellEffectLanguage(spellEffect);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the LanguageMgr singleton has been
    initialized. It's typically invoked during server startup or when new spell data
    is loaded dynamically. The method assumes that the SpellEffectEntry parameter
    is valid and properly populated with necessary data fields.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid SpellEffectEntry pointer may
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure proper validation of input parameters
    before invocation.
