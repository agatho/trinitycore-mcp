documentation:
  brief: Applies the Barbed Shot effect to the beast mastery pet's current target.
  description: The ApplyBarbedShot method implements the mechanics of the Barbed Shot
    ability for a beast mastery hunter's pet. This ability applies a damage-over-time
    effect to the pet's current target, dealing periodic damage and potentially causing
    the target to bleed. The method typically handles the application of the debuff,
    damage calculation, and any associated visual effects or animations. It is generally
    called when the hunter uses the Barbed Shot ability while the pet has an active
    target. This method does not directly deal damage but rather initiates the effect
    that will cause damage over time.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

    code: "void HunterPetAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_barbedShotTimer <=\
      \ diff)\n    {\n        m_beastMasteryManager->ApplyBarbedShot();\n        m_barbedShotTimer\
      \ = 10000; // Reset timer\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_barbedShotTimer\
      \ -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the pet's AI system or directly from
    the hunter's spell casting logic. The actual damage dealt by Barbed Shot is handled
    separately through periodic tick events, not within this method itself.
  warnings: Ensure that the pet has a valid target before calling this method to avoid
    potential errors or undefined behavior. This method should only be called when
    the pet is actively engaged in combat.
