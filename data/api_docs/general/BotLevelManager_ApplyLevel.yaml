  signature: bool BotLevelManager::ApplyLevel(Player * bot, BotCreationTask * task)
documentation:
  brief: Applies level adjustments to a bot player based on creation task parameters
  description: The ApplyLevel method in BotLevelManager is responsible for adjusting
    a bot player's level according to the specifications defined in a BotCreationTask.
    This method ensures that the bot's experience points, stats, and other level-related
    attributes are properly configured to match the desired level set in the creation
    task. The method typically performs validation checks to ensure the requested
    level is within acceptable bounds and may trigger necessary updates to the player's
    game state. It returns true if the level adjustment was successfully applied,
    or false if any error occurred during the process.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose level is
      to be adjusted
  - name: task
    description: Pointer to the BotCreationTask object containing level configuration
      and parameters for the bot
  returns: True if the level adjustment was successfully applied to the bot, false
    otherwise. Returns false if validation fails or if an error occurs during the
    application process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BotLevelManager levelManager;\nPlayer* bot = ...; // Get bot player reference\n\
      BotCreationTask* task = ...; // Get creation task with desired level\nbool success\
      \ = levelManager.ApplyLevel(bot, task);\nif (success) {\n    // Level applied\
      \ successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: With Error Handling
    code: "BotLevelManager levelManager;\nPlayer* bot = ...;\nBotCreationTask* task\
      \ = ...;\n\nif (!levelManager.ApplyLevel(bot, task)) {\n    // Handle failure\
      \ case\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to apply level to bot %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      } else {\n    // Level applied successfully\n    sLog->outInfo(\"Successfully\
      \ applied level to bot %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's player management systems
    and may trigger events or updates related to character progression. The method
    should be called after the bot has been properly initialized but before it is
    fully active in the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotCreationTask contains valid level data before calling
    this method, as invalid parameters could cause the method to return false without
    applying any changes. This method may not be thread-safe and should be called
    from the main game thread.
