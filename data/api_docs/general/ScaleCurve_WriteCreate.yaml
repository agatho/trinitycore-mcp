  class: ScaleCurve
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void ScaleCurve::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const AreaTrigger * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes and writes scale curve data into a byte buffer for client synchronization.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the scale curve's data into a ByteBuffer,
    which is then sent to a specific player's client as part of an AreaTrigger update.
    This method ensures that the client receives all necessary information about the
    scale curve associated with an area trigger, allowing proper visual and functional
    behavior in-game. The serialization includes relevant properties such as curve
    type, control points, and timing parameters needed for interpolation. It is typically
    invoked during the initialization or update of area triggers to synchronize state
    between server and client.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized scale curve data will
      be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the AreaTrigger object that owns this scale curve. Used
      to determine relevant properties and context for serialization.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive this serialized data.
      May be used to apply player-specific adjustments or filters during serialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AreaTrigger Update
    code: "void MyAreaTrigger::UpdatePlayerVision(Player* player)\n{\n    ByteBuffer\
      \ data;\n    scaleCurve.WriteCreate(data, this, player);\n    player->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Sending Scale Curve Data to Multiple Players
    code: "void AreaTriggerManager::BroadcastScaleCurveUpdate(AreaTrigger* trigger)\n\
      {\n    for (auto& pair : GetPlayersInRange(trigger))\n    {\n        ByteBuffer\
      \ data;\n        trigger->GetScaleCurve()->WriteCreate(data, trigger, pair.second);\n\
      \        pair.second->SendDirectMessage(&data);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided AreaTrigger and Player pointers are
    valid and not null. It is designed to be thread-safe in terms of data access but
    may require synchronization if underlying data structures are modified concurrently.
    The ByteBuffer must have sufficient capacity or be properly resized before calling
    this method.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or dangling pointers as it will likely
    result in undefined behavior. Ensure the AreaTrigger and Player objects remain
    valid throughout the duration of the method execution.
