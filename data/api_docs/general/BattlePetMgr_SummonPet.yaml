documentation:
  brief: Summons a battle pet for the player using the specified GUID.
  description: The SummonPet method is responsible for bringing a battle pet into
    the game world for a player character. It takes a unique identifier (GUID) that
    corresponds to a specific battle pet in the player's collection and activates
    it within the game environment. This method likely handles the visual and functional
    aspects of pet summoning, including updating the player's pet list, displaying
    the pet in the UI, and ensuring proper interaction with combat systems. The method
    is typically invoked when a player chooses to activate or recall a battle pet
    during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the battle pet to be summoned. This
      value should correspond to an existing battle pet in the player's collection
      and is typically obtained from database storage or pet management systems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Pet Summoning
    code: 'BattlePetMgr* petManager = player->GetBattlePetMgr();

      petManager->SummonPet(12345); // Summons the battle pet with GUID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the player's battle pet database and may
    trigger UI updates. It should only be called when a valid pet GUID is provided
    to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent GUID may result in
    errors or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the GUID corresponds to a pet that
    actually exists in the player's collection before invoking this method.
