documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the player is in a friendly area, returning true if the
    current zone allows friendly fire.
  description: The IsFriendlyArea method checks if the player's current area allows
    for friendly fire, meaning whether the player can engage in combat with other
    players or creatures without being flagged as hostile. This method is crucial
    for determining the player's status within the game world and helps establish
    whether they are in a safe zone or a contested area. The function evaluates the
    AreaTableEntry of the current zone to determine if friendly fire is permitted,
    which is essential for gameplay mechanics related to PvP and player-versus-player
    combat.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player's current area allows friendly fire, false otherwise.
    This indicates that the player can engage in combat with other players or creatures
    without being flagged as hostile.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (player->IsFriendlyArea(area))\n{\n    // Player is in a friendly area\n\
      \    // Can engage in PvP combat\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Player is in a hostile\
      \ area\n    // Cannot engage in PvP combat\n}"

  notes: This method relies on the AreaTableEntry data to determine whether friendly
    fire is allowed. It may be affected by zone flags and player status, particularly
    in PvP zones. Performance considerations include checking area entries efficiently
    and avoiding unnecessary calls when determining player status.
  warnings: This method may not account for all edge cases involving player status
    or zone flags. Be cautious when using this method in PvP scenarios where player
    status is involved, as it might not reflect the actual combat status of the player.
