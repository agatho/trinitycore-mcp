documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the bot supports hero talents at a given level
  description: This method checks if the bot is capable of utilizing hero talents
    based on its current level. Hero talents are a special category of talents that
    become available at specific levels in World of Warcraft, typically providing
    powerful abilities or passive bonuses. The method evaluates the bot's level against
    known thresholds for hero talent availability and returns true if the bot can
    access these talents, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for proper
    talent management and ensures that bots do not attempt to use talents they are
    not yet eligible for.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot supports hero talents at the specified level, false
    otherwise. The method considers the bot's current level and determines whether
    it has reached the minimum level requirement to access hero talents in the game.
  examples:
  - title: Check if bot supports hero talents at level 60
    code: "BotTalentManager talentManager;\nbool supportsHeroTalents = talentManager.SupportsHeroTalents(60);\n\
      if (supportsHeroTalents)\n{\n    // Bot can use hero talents\n    printf(\"\
      Bot supports hero talents at level 60\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal bot configuration data and game rules
    to determine talent eligibility. It may be called during bot initialization or
    talent tree updates to ensure proper talent assignment. The implementation should
    account for different class-specific hero talent requirements.
  warnings: Ensure that the level parameter is valid and within expected bounds, as
    invalid levels might cause unexpected behavior in the talent evaluation logic.
    This method should not be used to validate actual talent points spent, but rather
    to determine eligibility for talent acquisition.
