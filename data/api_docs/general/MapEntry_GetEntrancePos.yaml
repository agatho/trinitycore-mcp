documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the entrance position coordinates for a map entry.
  description: The GetEntrancePos method retrieves the entrance position (map ID and
    coordinates) associated with a specific map entry. This method is typically used
    to determine where players should be teleported when entering a particular zone
    or instance. The method populates the provided reference parameters with the map
    identifier and X/Y coordinates of the entrance point. It returns true if valid
    entrance data exists for the map, false otherwise. This functionality is essential
    for proper zone transitions and instance management within the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the map entry has valid entrance position data and the
    parameters were successfully populated; returns false if no entrance data is available
    or if the operation failed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Map Entrance Position
    code: "MapEntry* entry = sMapStore.LookupEntry(1234);\nif (entry)\n{\n    int32\
      \ mapId;\n    float x, y;\n    if (entry->GetEntrancePos(mapId, x, y))\n   \
      \ {\n        // Successfully retrieved entrance position\n        printf(\"\
      Entrance: Map %d, X: %.2f, Y: %.2f\\n\", mapId, x, y);\n    }\n    else\n  \
      \  {\n        // No entrance data available\n        printf(\"No entrance position\
      \ found for map %d\\n\", 1234);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used in map-related systems such as instance management,
    zone transitions, and player teleportation logic. The entrance position data may
    be defined in the game's database or configuration files for each map entry.
