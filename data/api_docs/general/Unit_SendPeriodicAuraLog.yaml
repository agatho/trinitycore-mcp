documentation:
  brief: SendPeriodicAuraLog sends a periodic aura log message to the client for a
    spell that has a periodic effect.
  description: This method is used to send periodic aura log information to the player's
    client when a spell with periodic effects (such as damage over time or healing
    over time) is applied or updated. It handles the communication of periodic damage,
    healing, or other periodic effects that occur at regular intervals during the
    duration of a spell. The method ensures that the client receives proper updates
    about the periodic effects of spells, which is crucial for maintaining accurate
    gameplay mechanics and visual feedback for players.
  parameters:
  - name: pInfo
    description: Pointer to a SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo structure containing information
      about the periodic aura being sent. This includes details such as the spell
      ID, damage type, amount of periodic effect, and other relevant data needed for
      client-side processing.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* target = GetTarget();

      SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo* pInfo = new SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo();

      pInfo->spellId = 12345;

      pInfo->damage = 50;

      pInfo->type = SPELL_AURA_PERIODIC_DAMAGE;

      target->SendPeriodicAuraLog(pInfo);'

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell handling logic and
    should be called when a periodic effect is applied or updated. It requires proper
    initialization of the SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo structure before being sent to
    ensure accurate client-side processing.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to incorrect visual feedback
    for players, potentially causing confusion about spell effects or duration. Ensure
    that all fields in the SpellPeriodicAuraLogInfo structure are properly initialized
    before calling this method.
