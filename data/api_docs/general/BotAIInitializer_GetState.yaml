documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current initialization state of the BotAI system
  description: The GetState method returns the current AI initialization state of
    the BotAI system, indicating whether the bot's AI components have been fully initialized,
    are in progress of initialization, or have encountered an error during setup.
    This state is crucial for determining the readiness of a bot's AI subsystem before
    attempting to interact with it or perform actions. The returned AIInitState enum
    value provides insight into the internal state machine managing the bot's AI initialization
    process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an AIInitState enumeration value representing the current initialization
    status of the BotAI system. Possible values typically include INIT_STATE_UNINITIALIZED,
    INIT_STATE_INITIALIZING, INIT_STATE_INITIALIZED, and INIT_STATE_ERROR, indicating
    different stages or outcomes of the AI initialization process.
  examples:
  - title: Check BotAI Initialization State
    code: "BotAIInitializer* initializer = ...;\nAIInitState state = initializer->GetState();\n\
      if (state == INIT_STATE_INITIALIZED)\n{\n    // Bot AI is ready for use\n  \
      \  // Proceed with bot operations\n}\nelse if (state == INIT_STATE_ERROR)\n\
      {\n    // Handle initialization error\n    // Log error or attempt recovery\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. The
    returned state value should not be cached for extended periods as the AI initialization
    process may transition between states during runtime. This method provides a snapshot
    of the current state at the time of invocation.
  warnings: Do not assume that a state of INIT_STATE_INITIALIZED means the bot is
    immediately ready to perform actions - additional validation or setup steps might
    still be required depending on the specific implementation details of the BotAI
    system.
