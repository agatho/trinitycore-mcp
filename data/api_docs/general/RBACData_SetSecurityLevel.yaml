  class: RBACData
  method: SetSecurityLevel
  signature: void RBACData::SetSecurityLevel(uint8 id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the security level for the RBACData instance.
  description: The SetSecurityLevel method assigns a specified security level to an
    RBACData object. This security level determines the permissions and access rights
    of the associated user or entity within the TrinityCore system. The method updates
    internal state to reflect the new security level, which can affect what actions
    the user is permitted to perform in the game world. This is typically used during
    authentication or privilege escalation processes where a user's access level needs
    to be modified dynamically.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The security level identifier to set. Valid values are typically
      integers representing different permission tiers (e.g., 0 for no access, 1-255
      for various admin levels). Values should conform to the game's defined security
      level range.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Security Level to Admin
    code: 'RBACData rbac;

      rbac.SetSecurityLevel(3);

      // Sets the security level to admin (level 3)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Security Level Update
    code: "void UpdatePlayerAccess(Player* player, uint8 newLevel) {\n    RBACData*\
      \ data = player->GetRBACData();\n    if (data) {\n        data->SetSecurityLevel(newLevel);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal security level state of the RBACData
    object. It is recommended to validate the input value against known security levels
    before calling this method to prevent unexpected behavior or privilege escalation
    issues.
  warnings: Modifying security levels directly can lead to unintended access control
    issues. Ensure that only trusted code paths call this method and that proper validation
    occurs on the provided level ID.
