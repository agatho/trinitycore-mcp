  method: ~TransportMgr
  signature: void TransportMgr::~TransportMgr()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys the TransportMgr instance and cleans up all associated transport
    entities and resources.
  description: The TransportMgr destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    all transport-related data structures and entities managed by this class. In TrinityCore's
    context, transports refer to objects like boats, zeppelins, and other moving platforms
    that players can board and travel on. When the TransportMgr object is destroyed,
    it ensures that all active transports are properly removed from the game world,
    their associated passengers are safely disembarked, and any memory allocated for
    transport data is freed. This destructor typically gets called automatically when
    the server shuts down or when the TransportMgr instance goes out of scope. It's
    important to note that this method should not be called manually unless you're
    certain about the implications, as it's part of the automatic resource management
    system.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction during server shutdown
    code: "void ShutdownServer()\n{\n    // TransportMgr instance is automatically\
      \ destroyed here\n    // All transports and passengers are cleaned up\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor performs cleanup operations that are critical for maintaining
    server stability. It's designed to be thread-safe as part of the core game loop
    management, but developers should avoid manually invoking this destructor in normal
    gameplay code. The destruction process may involve multiple steps including passenger
    dismounting, database cleanup, and memory deallocation.
  warnings: Manually calling this destructor can lead to undefined behavior or crashes
    if other systems are still referencing transport entities. Never invoke this method
    directly unless you're implementing a custom shutdown sequence or testing cleanup
    logic. The destructor assumes that all transport-related systems have already
    been properly shut down.
