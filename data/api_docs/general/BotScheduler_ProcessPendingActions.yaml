documentation:
  brief: Processes all pending bot actions in the scheduler queue
  description: The ProcessPendingActions method iterates through all queued bot actions
    and executes them in the appropriate order. This method is typically called during
    the game loop to ensure that scheduled bot behaviors, such as movement, combat
    actions, or interaction with objects, are performed in a timely manner. It handles
    action prioritization and ensures that no pending actions are skipped due to timing
    constraints. The method operates on the current state of the bot scheduler and
    may modify internal state variables related to action execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in game loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    botScheduler.ProcessPendingActions();\n\
      \    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game loop to maintain responsive
    bot behavior. It's designed to be non-blocking and will process only actions that
    are ready for execution based on their scheduled timing.
