  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetType
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetType(CalendarEventType eventType)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the type of the calendar event to the specified calendar event type.
  description: The SetType method assigns a CalendarEventType value to the calendar
    event, determining its category or purpose within the game's calendar system.
    This method is typically used when creating or modifying calendar events to ensure
    they are properly categorized for display and functionality. The calendar event
    type influences how the event appears in the client UI, what notifications are
    triggered, and how it interacts with other calendar-related systems such as invitations
    and reminders.
  parameters:
  - name: eventType
    description: The CalendarEventType value to assign to this calendar event. Valid
      values include normal events, raids, dungeons, holidays, and other predefined
      calendar event types.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Raid Event Type
    code: 'CalendarEvent* event = new CalendarEvent();

      event->SetType(CALENDAR_EVENT_TYPE_RAID);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Assigning a Holiday Event Type
    code: "CalendarEvent* event = sCalendarMgr->GetEvent(12345);\nif (event)\n{\n\
      \    event->SetType(CALENDAR_EVENT_TYPE_HOLIDAY);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent object.
    It should be called before the event is added to the calendar system or sent to
    players to ensure proper display and functionality.
  warnings: Calling SetType on an already active calendar event may cause inconsistencies
    in client-side display if not handled carefully. Ensure that all related data
    (such as invitations) are also updated accordingly.
