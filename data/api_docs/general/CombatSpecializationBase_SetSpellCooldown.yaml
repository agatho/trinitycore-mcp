  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: SetSpellCooldown
  signature: void CombatSpecializationBase::SetSpellCooldown(uint32 spellId, uint32
    cooldownMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cooldown duration for a specified spell within the combat specialization.
  description: The SetSpellCooldown method configures the cooldown period for a given
    spell ID, determining how long the spell must wait before it can be used again.
    This method is typically utilized in combat specializations to manage spell availability
    and enforce game balance mechanics. The cooldown value is specified in milliseconds
    and directly affects the spell's usability within the player's current specialization
    context.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell for which the cooldown is being
      set. This must correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's database.
  - name: cooldownMs
    description: The cooldown duration in milliseconds. A value of 0 removes any existing
      cooldown, while positive values set the cooldown period.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 3-second cooldown for a spell
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      spec->SetSpellCooldown(12345, 3000); // Sets cooldown of spell ID 12345 to 3
      seconds'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing cooldown for a spell
    code: 'CombatSpecializationBase* spec = player->GetCombatSpecialization();

      spec->SetSpellCooldown(12345, 0); // Removes any existing cooldown for spell
      ID 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal cooldown state of the combat specialization.
    It does not directly send updates to the client; UI changes are typically handled
    separately through other mechanisms. The cooldown is applied immediately and affects
    subsequent spell usage within the specialization.
  warnings: Setting a cooldown to 0 may bypass certain game balance checks, especially
    if used inappropriately during combat. Ensure that cooldown modifications align
    with intended gameplay mechanics to prevent exploits or unintended behavior.
