  class: GroupCoordinator
  method: QueueForDungeon
  signature: bool GroupCoordinator::QueueForDungeon(uint32 dungeonId)
documentation:
  brief: Queues a group for entry into a specified dungeon.
  description: The QueueForDungeon method attempts to add the current group to the
    dungeon queue for the specified dungeon ID. This method is typically used by the
    GroupCoordinator to manage group participation in dungeon encounters. It handles
    the logic of checking if the group can queue for the given dungeon, including
    verifying group composition, level requirements, and existing queue status. The
    method returns true upon successful queuing or false if the operation fails due
    to invalid parameters, group state, or other constraints.
  parameters:
  - name: dungeonId
    description: The unique identifier of the dungeon to queue for. This value corresponds
      to the ID field in the dbc files for dungeon entries.
  returns: Returns true if the group was successfully queued for the specified dungeon,
    false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid dungeon ID, group not being
    ready, or other game state constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Dungeon Queue Usage
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = ...;\nuint32 dungeonId = 1234; // Example\
      \ dungeon ID\nif (coordinator->QueueForDungeon(dungeonId)) {\n    // Group successfully\
      \ queued\n    sLog->outString(\"Group queued for dungeon %u\", dungeonId);\n\
      } else {\n    // Queue failed\n    sLog->outError(\"Failed to queue group for\
      \ dungeon %u\", dungeonId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal dungeon queue systems and may
    perform checks such as group leader validation, instance lock status, and player
    readiness. It's designed to be called from the game logic flow when players initiate
    a dungeon entry.
  warnings: Ensure that the dungeonId is valid and corresponds to an actual dungeon
    in the game database. Calling this method with invalid IDs or on groups that are
    already queued may result in undefined behavior or silent failures.
