  class: WheatyExceptionReport
  method: WheatyUnhandledExceptionFilter
  signature: LONG WheatyExceptionReport::WheatyUnhandledExceptionFilter(PEXCEPTION_POINTERS
    pExceptionInfo)
documentation:
  brief: Handles unhandled exceptions in the TrinityCore server process by generating
    detailed crash reports for debugging purposes.
  description: The WheatyUnhandledExceptionFilter method serves as a structured exception
    handler that intercepts unhandled exceptions occurring within the TrinityCore
    server application. It is typically installed as a Windows Structured Exception
    Handling (SEH) filter using SetUnhandledExceptionFilter(). When an unhandled exception
    occurs, this function is invoked to capture detailed information about the crash,
    including stack traces, register states, and memory contents. The method then
    generates a comprehensive crash report file that can be used for post-mortem debugging
    and analysis. This mechanism helps developers identify and resolve critical runtime
    errors in the server environment without requiring a full server restart or external
    debugging tools.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER if the exception should be handled by
    this filter, or EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH if it should be passed to other handlers.
    In most cases, it returns EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER to prevent further propagation
    of the exception and ensure proper crash reporting.
  examples:
  - title: Installing the Exception Handler
    code: "int main()\n{\n    SetUnhandledExceptionFilter(WheatyExceptionReport::WheatyUnhandledExceptionFilter);\n\
      \    // ... rest of server initialization\n    return 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in debug builds or production environments
    where crash reporting is essential. It requires Windows platform support and may
    not be available on other operating systems. The generated crash reports are usually
    saved to disk with timestamps and process identifiers for later analysis.
  warnings: Do not call this function directly from application code; it should only
    be installed as an unhandled exception filter via SetUnhandledExceptionFilter().
    Improper usage can lead to infinite recursion or unexpected behavior in the exception
    handling chain.
