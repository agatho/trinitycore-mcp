documentation:
  brief: Resets the threat list for the AI-controlled creature, clearing all current
    threat values and target selections.
  description: The ResetThreatList method clears the threat table associated with
    the ScriptedAI instance, effectively removing all entries from the creature's
    threat list. This is typically used during AI behavior resets or when transitioning
    between different combat states. The method ensures that no prior threat data
    influences future targeting decisions, allowing for clean state management in
    scripted AI behaviors. It does not take any parameters and operates directly on
    the internal threat management system of the AI controller.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Reset
    code: "void BossAI::EnterCombat(Unit* who)\n{\n    // ... other combat initialization\
      \ code ...\n    ResetThreatList();\n    // ... continue with new threat management\
      \ ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called during AI state transitions or when a creature
    needs to re-evaluate its targets. It's important to understand that this operation
    clears the entire threat list, which may affect current target selection if not
    properly managed in conjunction with other AI logic.
