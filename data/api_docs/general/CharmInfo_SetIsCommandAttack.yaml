  class: CharmInfo

  signature: void CharmInfo::SetIsCommandAttack(bool val)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the charmed unit is in command attack mode.
  description: The SetIsCommandAttack method configures the charm behavior of a unit,
    specifically indicating whether it should be in command attack mode. This mode
    typically controls how the charmed creature responds to commands from its master,
    particularly in terms of aggressive actions and target selection. When enabled,
    the charmed unit may automatically attack targets commanded by its master, while
    disabled, it might follow different behavioral patterns such as defensive or passive
    stance. The method directly modifies an internal flag within the CharmInfo class
    that governs this behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: val
    description: Boolean value indicating whether command attack mode should be enabled
      (true) or disabled (false).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Command Attack Mode
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = unit->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetIsCommandAttack(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Command Attack Mode
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      charmInfo->SetIsCommandAttack(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state flags used by the AI system to determine
    behavior. It's typically called during charm initialization or when changing the
    combat mode of a charmed unit. The change takes effect immediately without requiring
    additional updates.
  warnings: Be cautious when calling this method on units that are not currently charmed,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior if the CharmInfo object is not properly initialized.
    Also, ensure that the unit's AI state is consistent with the new command attack
    mode setting.
