documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier (GUID) of the current target entity.
  description: The GetTarget method retrieves the global unique identifier (GUID)
    of the bot's current target. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this GUID
    corresponds to a specific game object such as a player, creature, or game object
    that the bot is currently targeting. The method is typically used within AI decision-making
    logic to determine what entity the bot should act upon. This value may be zero
    if the bot has no target or if the target is invalid. The returned GUID can be
    used in conjunction with other TrinityCore APIs to retrieve detailed information
    about the target entity.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the current target entity. Returns
    0 if there is no valid target or if the target has been invalidated.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot has a target
    code: "if (botAI->GetTarget() != 0)\n{\n    // Bot has a valid target\n    uint64\
      \ targetGUID = botAI->GetTarget();\n    // Use targetGUID with ObjectAccessor\
      \ or similar API\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using target GUID to get target object
    code: "uint64 targetGUID = botAI->GetTarget();\nif (targetGUID != 0)\n{\n    Unit*\
      \ target = ObjectAccessor::GetUnit(*bot, targetGUID);\n    if (target)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Perform actions on the target\n        bot->CastSpell(target,\
      \ SPELL_FIREBALL, true);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the BotAI system which simulates player behavior in
    TrinityCore. The GUID returned by GetTarget should be used carefully as it may
    become invalid if the target dies or leaves the game world. It's recommended to
    validate the target before using its GUID in operations that require active objects.
  warnings: Using an invalid or stale GUID returned by this method can lead to crashes
    or undefined behavior. Always verify that the target is still valid before performing
    operations on it. The method returns zero when no valid target exists, which should
    be checked before proceeding with any target-dependent logic.
