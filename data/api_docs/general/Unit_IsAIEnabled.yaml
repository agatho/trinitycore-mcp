documentation:
  brief: Determines whether AI is enabled for the unit.
  description: This method checks if Artificial Intelligence is active for the specified
    unit, returning true if AI is enabled and false otherwise. It is commonly used
    in game mechanics to determine if a creature or player has AI behavior enabled,
    which affects how they respond to events and interactions within the game world.
    The method typically returns true when the unit has an AI script assigned and
    false when AI is disabled or not implemented.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if AI is enabled for the unit, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the unit's AI system is active and functioning.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsAIEnabled())\n{\n    // Perform AI-related actions\n    //\
      \ e.g., attack target, move to position\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    such as IsInCombat or GetAI. It may be called frequently during gameplay, so performance
    considerations should be taken into account when using it in loops or conditional
    statements.
  warnings: This method does not guarantee that the unit has a valid AI script; it
    only checks if AI is enabled. Be cautious when relying on this method for determining
    whether a unit will respond to certain events or behaviors.
