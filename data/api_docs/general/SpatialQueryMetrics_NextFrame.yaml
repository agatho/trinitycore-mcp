documentation:
  brief: Advances the spatial query metrics to the next frame, resetting per-frame
    counters and updating timing information.
  description: The NextFrame method is responsible for advancing the internal state
    of the SpatialQueryMetrics class to the next game frame. This method typically
    resets per-frame statistics such as query counts, timing data, and other transient
    metrics that are tracked on a per-frame basis. It ensures that performance measurements
    and spatial query statistics are properly maintained and updated for each new
    frame, allowing for accurate monitoring of spatial query performance over time.
    The method is usually called at the beginning of each game loop cycle to prepare
    the metrics system for the upcoming frame's data collection.

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    sSpatialQueryMetrics->NextFrame();\n\
      \    // ... continue with frame processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called once per game frame, typically at the start
    of the frame processing cycle. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient,
    with minimal performance impact during normal operation.
