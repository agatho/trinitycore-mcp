documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a 64-bit data value associated with a zone script, typically used
    for storing and retrieving unique identifiers or state information.
  description: The GetData64 method is a virtual function in the ZoneScript class
    that retrieves a 64-bit unsigned integer value. This method is commonly used within
    TrinityCore's zone scripting system to store and retrieve persistent data related
    to zone-specific events, creature encounters, or object states. The implementation
    typically involves a lookup table or internal storage mechanism where data is
    indexed by a parameter (even though the current signature shows no parameters,
    it's expected that param0 is passed in from the calling context). This method
    allows scripts to maintain state across different events and conditions within
    a zone without relying on global variables. It's particularly useful for tracking
    unique identifiers such as GUIDs of creatures or game objects, or for managing
    flags and counters that persist throughout the lifetime of a zone.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint64 value representing the requested data. The actual meaning
    of this value depends on how it was previously set using SetData64 or similar
    methods. Common uses include returning GUIDs of specific creatures, object IDs,
    or state flags that are used to control zone behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieving a Creature GUID
    code: "uint64 bossGUID = instance->GetData64(DATA_BOSS_GUID);\nif (bossGUID)\n\
      {\n    // Use the boss GUID for further operations\n    if (Creature* boss =\
      \ instance->GetCreature(bossGUID))\n    {\n        // Perform actions on the\
      \ boss creature\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Zone State Flags
    code: "uint64 encounterState = instance->GetData64(DATA_ENCOUNTER_STATE);\nif\
      \ (encounterState & ENCOUNTER_FLAG_COMPLETED)\n{\n    // Encounter has been\
      \ completed\n    // Handle post-completion logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the ZoneScript interface and should be overridden
    in custom zone scripts. The method signature shows no parameters, but it's expected
    that param0 will be passed from the calling context (e.g., through a wrapper or
    dispatcher). The actual implementation may involve internal mapping or lookup
    tables to associate identifiers with data values.
  warnings: This method assumes that the data has been previously set using SetData64
    or similar methods. Calling GetData64 without prior initialization can result
    in undefined behavior or return zero values. Be careful when interpreting returned
    values as they might represent GUIDs, flags, or other zone-specific identifiers
    that require proper validation before use.
