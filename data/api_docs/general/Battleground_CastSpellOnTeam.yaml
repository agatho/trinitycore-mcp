api:
  class: Battleground
  method: CastSpellOnTeam
  signature: void Battleground::CastSpellOnTeam(int SpellID, int team)
documentation:
  brief: Casts a specified spell on all players belonging to the given team within
    the battleground.
  description: The CastSpellOnTeam method is used to apply a spell effect to all players
    on a specific team during a battleground. This method iterates through all active
    players on the specified team and applies the spell using the underlying TrinityCore
    spell system. It's commonly used for applying area-of-effect spells, buffs, or
    debuffs that affect entire teams simultaneously. The method does not validate
    whether the spell is valid or whether the team exists; it assumes these parameters
    are correctly provided by the caller. This functionality is essential for implementing
    battleground mechanics such as flag captures, area damage effects, or team-wide
    buff systems.
  parameters:
  - name: SpellID
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to be cast. Must correspond to
      a valid spell entry in the database.
  - name: team
    description: The team ID to which the spell will be applied. Typically 0 for Alliance
      and 1 for Horde, though values may vary based on battleground implementation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply Fire Resistance Buff to All Horde Players
    code: "Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(player);\nif (bg)\n\
      {\n    bg->CastSpellOnTeam(12345, HORDE); // Applies spell ID 12345 to all Horde\
      \ players\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Apply Area Damage Spell to Both Teams
    code: "Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground();\nif (bg)\n{\n    bg->CastSpellOnTeam(98765,\
      \ ALLIANCE); // Apply to Alliance\n    bg->CastSpellOnTeam(98765, HORDE);  \
      \ // Apply to Horde\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the battleground's current player list and does not
    account for players who may have left or been removed from the battleground during
    execution. It is recommended to verify that the battleground instance and team
    are valid before calling this method. Performance impact depends on the number
    of players in the specified team.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid SpellID will result in a failed spell
    cast without error reporting. Ensure all parameters are validated before use.
    Be cautious when applying spells that might cause stacking or conflict issues
    with existing player effects.
