  method: GetRole
  signature: GroupRole GroupCoordinator::GetRole() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the role assigned to the group coordinator within a group context.
  description: The GetRole method returns the GroupRole enumeration value that represents
    the current role of the GroupCoordinator instance. This role typically defines
    the coordinator's responsibilities and permissions within a group, such as leader,
    assistant, or member. The method is const and does not modify any internal state
    of the object. It is commonly used in group management systems to determine what
    actions the coordinator can perform, especially in scenarios involving loot distribution,
    group leadership, and role-based access control.
  parameters: []
  returns: A GroupRole enumeration value indicating the current role assigned to this
    group coordinator. Possible values may include GROUP_ROLE_LEADER, GROUP_ROLE_ASSISTANT,
    or GROUP_ROLE_MEMBER depending on the implementation and group configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "GroupCoordinator* coordinator = GetGroupCoordinator();\nGroupRole role\
      \ = coordinator->GetRole();\nif (role == GROUP_ROLE_LEADER)\n{\n    // Perform\
      \ leader-specific actions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role-Based Logic
    code: "void HandleGroupAction(GroupCoordinator* coord)\n{\n    GroupRole role\
      \ = coord->GetRole();\n    switch (role)\n    {\n        case GROUP_ROLE_LEADER:\n\
      \            // Allow full group management\n            break;\n        case\
      \ GROUP_ROLE_ASSISTANT:\n            // Allow limited management\n         \
      \   break;\n        default:\n            // Standard member behavior\n    \
      \        break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only reads immutable state. The returned
    GroupRole value should be used immediately, as the coordinator's role may change
    during group operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupCoordinator instance is properly initialized before
    calling this method. Accessing GetRole on a null or uninitialized coordinator
    may result in undefined behavior.
