  class: BotAI
  method: RequestFollowMovement
  signature: bool BotAI::RequestFollowMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority priority,
    int targetGuid, float distance, const std::string & reason, const std::string
    & sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Requests the bot to begin following a target player with specified movement
    priority and distance.
  description: The RequestFollowMovement method initiates a follow behavior for a
    bot AI, instructing it to move towards and maintain a specific distance from a
    target player. This method is typically used in player-controlled bot systems
    where bots need to dynamically follow players based on game events or commands.
    The method accepts parameters that define the priority of the movement, the target
    player's GUID, desired distance, and contextual information about why the movement
    is being requested. It returns true if the request was successfully queued or
    processed, false otherwise. This functionality is essential for implementing group
    mechanics, escort quests, or dynamic player assistance systems within TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft servers.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: Specifies the movement priority level (PlayerBotMovementPriority
      enum) which determines how urgently the bot should follow the target. Higher
      priority movements override lower ones.
  - name: targetGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player that the bot should follow.
      This value must correspond to a valid Player object in the game world.
  - name: distance
    description: The desired distance the bot should maintain from the target player
      during following. Values are typically in yards, with 0 indicating immediate
      proximity.
  - name: reason
    description: A descriptive string explaining why this follow movement was requested.
      Useful for debugging or logging purposes to track bot behavior.
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: Identifies the system or module that initiated this request, helping
      with tracking and potential conflict resolution between different AI systems.
  returns: Returns true if the movement request was successfully accepted and queued
    for processing by the bot's AI system. Returns false if the request failed due
    to invalid parameters, target unavailability, or internal system errors.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Request
    code: "if (botAI->RequestFollowMovement(PlayerBotMovementPriority::HIGH, playerGuid,\
      \ 3.0f, \"Quest escort\", \"QuestSystem\")) {\n    // Movement request accepted\n\
      } else {\n    // Handle failed request\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Follow with Priority Override
    code: "PlayerBotMovementPriority priority = PlayerBotMovementPriority::MEDIUM;\n\
      float distance = 5.0f;\nstd::string reason = \"Group formation\";\nstd::string\
      \ source = \"GroupManager\";\n\nbool success = botAI->RequestFollowMovement(priority,\
      \ targetGuid, distance, reason, source);\nif (success) {\n    // Bot will now\
      \ follow at specified distance with given priority\n} else {\n    // Log error\
      \ or fallback behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerBot AI framework and relies on the underlying
    movement engine to execute the actual pathfinding. The bot's current state must
    allow for movement changes, otherwise the request may be ignored. Multiple concurrent
    follow requests can be queued, with higher priority ones taking precedence.
  warnings: Ensure that the targetGuid corresponds to an active player object; otherwise,
    the method will likely fail silently or return false. Be cautious when using high-priority
    movements in rapid succession as they might interfere with other ongoing AI behaviors.
