  method: GetOverallThreatLevel
  signature: ThreatLevel GroupCoordination::GetOverallThreatLevel() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the overall threat level of the group coordination
    system.
  description: The GetOverallThreatLevel method computes and retrieves the aggregate
    threat level for all members within the group coordination context. This value
    represents the collective danger or hostility level that the group poses to its
    targets, typically used in AI decision-making processes for mob targeting and
    combat behavior. The method does not modify any internal state and is read-only.
    It aggregates individual threat levels from group members and applies normalization
    logic to determine a unified group-wide threat value.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a ThreatLevel enum value representing the overall calculated threat
    level of the group coordination system. Possible values may include LOW, MEDIUM,
    HIGH, or EXTREME depending on the aggregated threat from all group members and
    their current combat states.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ThreatLevel overallThreat = groupCoordination.GetOverallThreatLevel();\n\
      if (overallThreat == ThreatLevel::HIGH)\n{\n    // Handle high threat scenario\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Group is highly threatening\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs aggregation across all group members and may involve
    computational overhead if the group contains many units. The calculation likely
    considers individual member threat levels, their proximity to targets, and current
    combat engagement status.
