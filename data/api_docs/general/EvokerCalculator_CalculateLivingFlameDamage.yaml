  signature: int EvokerCalculator::CalculateLivingFlameDamage(int * caster, int *
    target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the damage output of the Living Flame spell based on caster and
    target stats
  description: The CalculateLivingFlameDamage method computes the total damage dealt
    by the Evoker's Living Flame ability. This calculation takes into account various
    factors including the caster's spell power, the target's resilience, and any applicable
    damage modifiers. The method performs a series of stat evaluations and applies
    damage scaling based on the Evoker's class mechanics and spell coefficients. It
    is designed to be used within the combat system when the Living Flame spell is
    cast, ensuring accurate damage distribution according to World of Warcraft's damage
    calculation rules.
  parameters:
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the caster's stats structure containing spell power and
      relevant modifiers for damage calculation
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target's stats structure containing resilience and
      other defensive attributes that affect incoming damage
  returns: Returns an integer representing the calculated damage amount. A value of
    0 indicates no damage was dealt, while positive integers represent the actual
    damage dealt to the target.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'EvokerCalculator calculator;

      int casterStats[] = {1000, 500}; // spellPower, critChance

      int targetStats[] = {800, 200};   // resilience, armor

      int damage = calculator.CalculateLivingFlameDamage(casterStats, targetStats);

      // damage contains the calculated Living Flame damage value'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both caster and target parameters point to valid
    stat structures with sufficient data. The calculation includes basic damage scaling
    but does not account for critical strikes or other advanced combat mechanics that
    may be applied later in the combat processing pipeline.
  warnings: Ensure that the pointers passed to this method are valid and contain properly
    initialized data. Passing null or uninitialized pointers will result in undefined
    behavior. The method does not perform any validation on input values, so invalid
    stat values could lead to incorrect damage calculations.
