  class: VMapManager2
  method: InitializeThreadUnsafe
  signature: void VMapManager2::InitializeThreadUnsafe(uint32 mapId, int32 parentMapId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes thread-unsafe virtual map data for a specified map ID and its
    parent map ID.
  description: The InitializeThreadUnsafe method prepares virtual map data structures
    for a given map ID, including its parent map ID. This initialization is typically
    performed during server startup or when loading new map data into memory. The
    method ensures that the virtual map system has all necessary data to handle line-of-sight
    and collision detection for the specified map. It is marked as thread-unsafe because
    it should only be called from a single thread, typically during server initialization
    or map loading phases. This method does not perform any locking mechanisms, so
    concurrent access must be managed externally.
  parameters:
  - name: mapId
    description: The unique identifier of the map to initialize virtual map data for.
      This corresponds to the Map ID used internally by TrinityCore's map system.
  - name: parentMapId
    description: The identifier of the parent map, which may be -1 if the map has
      no parent. This is used in hierarchical map structures where child maps inherit
      properties from parent maps.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Map Initialization
    code: 'VMapManager2* vmapManager = VMapManager2::getInstance();

      vmapManager->InitializeThreadUnsafe(0, -1); // Initialize map ID 0 (Eastern
      Kingdoms) with no parent'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Child Map with Parent
    code: 'VMapManager2* vmapManager = VMapManager2::getInstance();

      vmapManager->InitializeThreadUnsafe(1, 0); // Initialize map ID 1 (Kalimdor)
      with parent map ID 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called during server initialization or when
    loading new maps. It should not be invoked concurrently from multiple threads
    without external synchronization. The method assumes that the necessary VMap files
    are already available in the expected directory structure. Performance considerations
    include memory allocation for map data structures, which can be significant for
    large maps.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid map IDs or without proper file system
    setup may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This method is not thread-safe
    and must be called from a single thread context. It's recommended to call this
    method only during server startup or map loading phases, not during active gameplay.
