documentation:
  brief: Exports collected bot metrics in JSON format for external consumption or
    logging.
  description: The ExportMetricsAsJson method serializes all collected bot metrics
    into a structured JSON string representation. This allows for easy integration
    with monitoring systems, logging frameworks, or external analytics tools. The
    method is typically used to provide real-time insights into bot behavior, performance,
    and activity within the World of Warcraft environment. It does not modify any
    internal state and can be called at any time during runtime. The resulting JSON
    string includes all relevant metric data such as uptime, actions performed, resource
    usage, and other tracked statistics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::string containing the complete set of collected bot metrics serialized
    in JSON format. The string is formatted with proper JSON syntax including keys,
    values, and nested structures representing the various metrics collected by the
    IBotMetricsCollector instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotMetricsCollector* collector = GetBotMetricsCollector();

      std::string jsonOutput = collector->ExportMetricsAsJson();

      // Output can now be logged or sent to an external system

      std::cout << "Metrics: " << jsonOutput << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete serialization of all collected metrics, which
    may have performance implications if called very frequently. It is recommended
    to cache the result or call it at reasonable intervals rather than on every game
    tick. The JSON output format is consistent and stable across different bot instances.
