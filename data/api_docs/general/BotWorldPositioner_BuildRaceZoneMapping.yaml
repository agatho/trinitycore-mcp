documentation:
  brief: Initializes and constructs a mapping of race-specific zone data for bot positioning
    within the game world.
  description: The BuildRaceZoneMapping method is responsible for constructing an
    internal data structure that associates player races with relevant zone information
    used by the bot AI system. This mapping enables bots to determine appropriate
    spawn zones, movement patterns, and area-specific behaviors based on the racial
    characteristics of the bots. The method typically iterates through available race
    and zone combinations, populating an internal lookup table or map structure. It
    is commonly invoked during initialization phases of the bot AI subsystem or when
    game data is refreshed. This mapping is crucial for ensuring that bots spawn in
    appropriate zones and behave according to race-specific mechanics, such as faction-based
    restrictions or zone-specific quest availability.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotWorldPositioner positioner;

      positioner.BuildRaceZoneMapping();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization of the BotWorldPositioner
    class or when game data needs to be refreshed. The internal mapping structure
    may be cached and reused across multiple bot instances, making this a performance-critical
    operation that should ideally run once per server session rather than repeatedly.
  warnings: Invoking this method after bots have already been spawned or initialized
    may cause inconsistencies in bot behavior. Ensure all existing bots are properly
    cleaned up before rebuilding the mapping to avoid undefined behavior.
