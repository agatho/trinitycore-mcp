  signature: int32 PlayerDataAccessor::GetCurrencyQuantity(int32 currencyId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current quantity of a specified currency item for the player.
  description: The GetCurrencyQuantity method fetches the amount of a specific currency
    type that the player currently possesses. This method is commonly used in World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to manage and display player resources such
    as honor points, arena points, or other in-game currencies. The method takes a
    currency identifier (currencyId) as input and returns an integer representing
    how many units of that currency the player has. It does not modify any game state
    and is safe for read-only operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an int32 value indicating the quantity of the specified currency
    item. A return value of zero means the player has no units of that currency, while
    negative values are typically not expected but may indicate an error or invalid
    currency ID.
  examples:
  - title: Get Honor Points Quantity
    code: int32 honorPoints = playerData->GetCurrencyQuantity(CURRENCY_TYPE_HONOR_POINTS);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Currency Availability Before Spending
    code: "int32 arenaPoints = playerData->GetCurrencyQuantity(CURRENCY_TYPE_ARENA_POINTS);\n\
      if (arenaPoints >= 100) {\n    // Player can spend 100 arena points\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal currency tracking within the player's data
    store. Ensure that the currencyId passed is valid and corresponds to an actual
    currency defined in the game's database or configuration files. The method may
    not reflect real-time updates if called outside of appropriate event handlers.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent currencyId may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect return values. Always validate currency IDs against known
    constants or database entries before calling this method to avoid unexpected outcomes.
