  signature: int PetStable::GetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the index of the first unslotted pet in the stable.
  description: The GetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex method retrieves the index of the first
    available slot in the pet stable that does not currently contain a pet. This is
    used to determine where a new pet can be placed when adding one to the stable.
    The method iterates through the stable's pet slots and returns the index of the
    first slot with a value of -1, indicating an empty slot. If all slots are occupied,
    it may return -1 or the size of the stable depending on implementation details.
    This functionality is essential for managing pet storage and ensuring proper slot
    allocation within the game's pet management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the index of the first unslotted pet in the stable.
    Returns -1 if no unslotted pets are available or if all slots are occupied.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Available Pet Slot
    code: "int slotIndex = petStable->GetCurrentUnslottedPetIndex();\nif (slotIndex\
      \ >= 0) {\n    // There is an available slot\n    printf(\"Available slot at\
      \ index: %d\\n\", slotIndex);\n} else {\n    // No available slots\n    printf(\"\
      No available slots in pet stable\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that pet slots are represented as a sequential array
    or list where -1 indicates an empty slot. The implementation may vary depending
    on how the PetStable class stores its pet data internally.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in a multi-threaded environment without
    proper synchronization, as concurrent modifications to the stable could lead to
    inconsistent results. Also, ensure that returned indices are validated before
    use to avoid out-of-bounds access.
