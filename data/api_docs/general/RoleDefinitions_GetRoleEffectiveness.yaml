  class: RoleDefinitions
  method: GetRoleEffectiveness
  signature: float RoleDefinitions::GetRoleEffectiveness(uint8 classId, uint8 specId,
    GroupRole role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the effectiveness multiplier for a specific class
    specialization within a given group role.
  description: The GetRoleEffectiveness method determines how effective a particular
    class specialization is when fulfilling a specified group role in World of Warcraft.
    This calculation takes into account the class ID, specialization ID, and the intended
    group role to return a float value representing the effectiveness multiplier.
    The returned value typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates optimal
    effectiveness for that role and 0.0 indicates no effectiveness. This method is
    primarily used in group composition analysis, talent optimization, and raid planning
    mechanics within TrinityCore's framework.
  parameters:
  - name: classId
    description: The unique identifier of the player class (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2
      for Paladin, etc.). Must be a valid class ID defined in the game's class definitions.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID within the specified class. Each class can
      have multiple specializations, and this parameter identifies which one is being
      evaluated.
  - name: role
    description: The group role to evaluate effectiveness for. This should be a valid
      GroupRole enum value indicating roles like TANK, HEALER, or DAMAGE.
  returns: A float value representing the effectiveness multiplier of the specified
    class specialization for the given group role. Values typically range from 0.0
    (least effective) to 1.0 (most effective). Returns 0.0 if the combination of class,
    spec, and role is not recognized or considered valid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'float effectiveness = RoleDefinitions::GetRoleEffectiveness(7, 2, GroupRole::TANK);

      // Returns effectiveness of a Death Knight (classId=7) with Frost specialization
      (specId=2) for Tank role'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Group Composition Analysis
    code: "float healerEffectiveness = RoleDefinitions::GetRoleEffectiveness(5, 1,\
      \ GroupRole::HEALER);\nif (healerEffectiveness > 0.8f) {\n    // This class/spec\
      \ combination is highly effective for healing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal lookup tables or configuration data to determine
    effectiveness values. It may be called frequently during group composition calculations,
    so performance should be considered in high-frequency scenarios. The method assumes
    valid inputs and does not perform input validation internally.
  warnings: Ensure that classId and specId correspond to valid combinations as defined
    in the game's database. Invalid combinations might return unexpected results or
    0.0. This method may not be thread-safe if it accesses shared internal state without
    synchronization.
