documentation:
  brief: Teleports the player to the nearest graveyard.
  description: This method handles the teleportation of a player to their nearest
    graveyard, typically used in spell effects that require players to be moved to
    a specific location. The method is commonly associated with graveyard-based spells
    and can be triggered by various game mechanics such as death-related spells or
    teleportation effects. It ensures that the player's position is updated to match
    the graveyard coordinates, which may involve movement of the player to a different
    zone or instance.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell();

      spell->EffectTeleportGraveyard();'
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include ensuring that the player's position is correctly
    updated to match the graveyard location. Performance considerations may arise
    from the need to handle multiple players simultaneously or during combat situations.
    This method should be thread-safe as it typically operates within a single-threaded
    context.
  warnings: This method may not be suitable for all spell effects and can cause issues
    if used inappropriately, such as when a player is already in combat or when the
    graveyard location is not properly defined.
