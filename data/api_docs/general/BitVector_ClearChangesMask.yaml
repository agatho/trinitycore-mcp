  signature: void BitVector::ClearChangesMask()
documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the bit vector, resetting all tracked modifications.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask of a BitVector
    instance, effectively clearing any previously tracked modifications. This is commonly
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage synchronization of object states
    between server and client. The method ensures that subsequent operations will
    not consider previously marked changes, allowing for clean state tracking after
    a synchronization event or update cycle. It is typically called when the system
    needs to acknowledge that all changes have been processed and committed.

  - title: Basic Usage in Object Synchronization
    code: 'BitVector myBitVector;

      // ... some modifications are made to myBitVector ...

      myBitVector.ClearChangesMask(); // Reset changes mask after sync'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is often used in conjunction with other BitVector operations
    like SetBit, ClearBit, and IsBitSet. It's crucial for maintaining accurate change
    tracking in TrinityCore's object state management systems.
