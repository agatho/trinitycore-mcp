  signature: void WorldSession::SendShowBank(int guid, PlayerInteractionType interactionType)
documentation:
  brief: Sends a bank window display packet to the player's client
  description: The SendShowBank method is responsible for transmitting a packet to
    the connected player's client that opens and displays the bank window interface.
    This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with a banker NPC or
    uses a bank vault, allowing the player to access their stored items and perform
    banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and managing inventory. The
    method takes a GUID parameter to identify the specific banker or bank object and
    an interaction type to determine the context of the interaction. This functionality
    is integral to World of Warcraft's core gameplay mechanics involving character
    progression and item management.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The global unique identifier (GUID) of the banker NPC or bank object
      that the player is interacting with. This value identifies which specific banker
      or bank vault should be displayed in the client interface.
  - name: interactionType
    description: An enumeration value indicating the type of player interaction with
      the banker. This determines how the bank window should behave and what options
      are available to the player during the interaction.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bank Window Display
    code: 'WorldSession* session = player->GetSession();

      session->SendShowBank(player->GetTargetGuid().GetRawValue(), PLAYER_INTERACTION_TYPE_BANK);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly communicates with the client through network packets
    and should only be called from the main game thread. The GUID parameter must reference
    a valid NPC or bank object in the world, otherwise the client may display an incorrect
    or empty interface.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation of the GUID or interaction
    type can result in client-side errors or unexpected behavior. Ensure that the
    player is within range of a valid banker before invoking this method.
