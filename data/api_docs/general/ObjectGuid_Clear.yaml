documentation:
  brief: Clears all bits of the ObjectGuid, resetting it to an invalid state
  description: The Clear method resets the ObjectGuid to an invalid state by clearing
    all its internal bits. This effectively sets the GUID to a null or zero value,
    making it unusable for identifying game objects until reassigned. The method is
    typically used when an object's GUID needs to be invalidated or reset before reassignment.
    In TrinityCore's context, this operation ensures that no stale references remain
    after an object has been destroyed or removed from the game world.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting a GUID to invalid state
    code: 'ObjectGuid guid;

      guid.SetRaw(12345);

      // ... use guid ...

      guid.Clear(); // Resets guid to invalid state

      assert(guid.IsEmpty());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a direct bit reset operation on the internal GUID storage.
    It's commonly used in object lifecycle management where an object needs to be
    marked as destroyed or unassigned before being reused.
