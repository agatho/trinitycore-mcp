  signature: const int * DB2Manager::GetMountDisplays(uint32 mountId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of display IDs associated with a specified mount ID from
    the DB2 database.
  description: The GetMountDisplays method fetches an array of display identifiers
    linked to a given mount identifier from the database. This function is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore server implementation to retrieve visual
    representation data for mounts, which are then utilized for rendering in-game
    graphics. The returned pointer points to an internal static array that contains
    the display IDs; it should not be modified or freed by the caller. The method
    assumes that the mount ID exists within the DB2 files and that the database has
    been properly initialized with mount-related data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an integer array containing the display IDs associated
    with the specified mount ID. If no displays are found for the given mount ID,
    it may return a pointer to an empty array or null depending on implementation
    details. The caller must not modify or free the returned memory.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through mount displays
    code: "const int* displays = sDB2Manager->GetMountDisplays(12345);\nif (displays)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; displays[i] != 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Display\
      \ ID: %d\\n\", displays[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal DB2 data structures and relies on proper initialization
    of the DB2Manager. The returned array is static and must not be freed or modified
    by the caller. Performance-wise, this function is optimized for frequent lookups
    but depends on the underlying DB2 file indexing.
  warnings: Do not attempt to free or modify the memory pointed to by the return value.
    Incorrect usage may lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior. Ensure that
    the mount ID passed is valid and exists in the DB2 files, otherwise results are
    unpredictable.
