documentation:
  brief: Maintains the Guardian Druid's bear form state by ensuring the player remains
    in bear form and applying necessary mechanics.
  description: The MaintainBearForm method is responsible for managing the continuous
    application and upkeep of the Guardian Druid's Bear Form ability. This method
    ensures that the player remains in bear form, applies any required passive effects
    or auras, and handles the transition logic between different form states. It typically
    checks if the druid should remain in bear form based on current conditions such
    as threat level, combat status, or player actions. The method may also handle
    the automatic switching back to cat form when appropriate, such as when entering
    non-combat situations or when specific conditions are no longer met. This function
    is crucial for maintaining proper gameplay balance and ensuring that the Guardian
    Druid's bear form behaves according to World of Warcraft's design specifications.

  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI update loop
    code: "void GuardianDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\n\
      \    if (me->GetShapeshiftForm() == FORM_BEAR)\n        m_GuardianDruidRefactored.MaintainBearForm();\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the AI update cycle to ensure
    proper form maintenance. It may internally check for combat status and threat
    levels to determine if bear form should be maintained or if a transition to another
    form is necessary.
  warnings: Improper implementation of this method could lead to unexpected behavior
    where the druid fails to maintain bear form in combat, potentially causing gameplay
    imbalance or breaking class mechanics. Ensure that all conditions for maintaining
    bear form are properly evaluated before calling this method.
