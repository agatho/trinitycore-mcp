documentation:
  brief: Applies active mitigation effects to the Guardian Druid's current target.
  description: The HandleActiveMitigation method is responsible for processing and
    applying active mitigation mechanics specific to the Guardian Druid class. This
    method typically evaluates the druid's current state, including available abilities,
    cooldowns, and target conditions, to determine which mitigation effects should
    be activated. It may involve checking for aura states, calculating damage reduction
    values, and applying appropriate defensive buffs or abilities such as Barkskin,
    Survival Instincts, or other mitigation-based talents. The method is designed
    to be called during combat updates or specific trigger events to ensure timely
    application of defensive measures.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update
    code: "void GuardianDruidAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (UpdateVictim())\n\
      \        HandleActiveMitigation();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during AI update cycles or when specific
    combat events occur. It assumes the druid has an active target and valid combat
    state. The implementation may involve multiple internal checks and could potentially
    trigger additional callbacks or events depending on the applied mitigation effects.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is only called when the Guardian Druid is in a
    valid combat state to avoid unintended behavior. Calling this method outside of
    combat contexts may lead to incorrect mitigation calculations or invalid aura
    applications.
