  class: TankPositioning
  method: TankPositioning
  signature: void TankPositioning::TankPositioning(const TankPositionConfig & config)
documentation:
  brief: Configures and initializes tank positioning behavior based on provided configuration
    settings.
  description: The TankPositioning method is responsible for setting up the positioning
    logic for a tank unit within the game world. It takes a TankPositionConfig object
    as input which defines various parameters such as target position, movement speed,
    orientation, and positioning constraints. This method typically gets invoked during
    NPC AI initialization or when a tank needs to reposition itself in response to
    combat conditions. The configuration determines how the tank will move, rotate,
    and maintain its position relative to targets or waypoints. It is commonly used
    in scripted encounters, boss fights, or any scenario where precise tank positioning
    is required for gameplay balance.
  parameters:
  - name: config
    description: A const reference to a TankPositionConfig object containing all necessary
      parameters for configuring the tank's positioning behavior including target
      coordinates, movement speed, rotation settings, and positioning constraints.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Tank Positioning Setup
    code: 'TankPositionConfig config;

      config.targetX = 100.0f;

      config.targetY = 200.0f;

      config.targetZ = 50.0f;

      config.speed = 3.0f;

      config.rotation = 90.0f;

      tank->TankPositioning(config);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Tank Positioning with Constraints
    code: 'TankPositionConfig config;

      config.targetX = boss->GetPositionX();

      config.targetY = boss->GetPositionY();

      config.targetZ = boss->GetPositionZ();

      config.speed = 2.5f;

      config.minDistance = 5.0f;

      config.maxDistance = 15.0f;

      config.rotation = 0.0f;

      tank->TankPositioning(config);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal tank state and should only be called when the
    tank is in a valid state for positioning changes. The configuration parameters
    are copied into internal structures, so modifying the original config after calling
    this method will not affect the tank's behavior. This method may trigger movement
    updates that could impact performance if called rapidly in succession.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the TankPositionConfig
    structure may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect positioning. Ensure that
    all required fields are properly set before invoking this method, especially target
    coordinates and speed parameters.
