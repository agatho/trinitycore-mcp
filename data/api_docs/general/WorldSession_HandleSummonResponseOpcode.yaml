  signature: void WorldSession::HandleSummonResponseOpcode(WorldPackets::Movement::SummonResponse
    & packet)
documentation:
  brief: Processes a summon response packet from the client when a player accepts
    or declines a summon request.
  description: The HandleSummonResponseOpcode method handles incoming summon response
    packets sent by the client. This method is invoked when a player responds to a
    summon request, either accepting or declining it. The method processes the response
    and updates the player's summon state accordingly. It typically manages the logic
    for handling summon requests initiated by other players or NPCs, ensuring proper
    synchronization of summon states between client and server. The method may also
    trigger additional game mechanics such as teleportation or quest progression depending
    on the context of the summon request.

  - title: Basic Summon Response Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSummonResponseOpcode(WorldPackets::Movement::SummonResponse&\
      \ packet)\n{\n    if (packet.Accepted)\n        HandleSummonAccept();\n    else\n\
      \        HandleSummonDecline();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the movement and summon system in TrinityCore. It's
    typically called from the main packet handling loop when a summon response opcode
    is received. The method assumes that the session has a valid player object and
    that the summon request was previously initiated by this session or another related
    session.
  warnings: Improper handling of summon responses may lead to players being unable
    to accept or decline summons, potentially causing stuck states or unexpected behavior
    in player movement and quest progression systems. Ensure proper validation of
    packet data before processing.
