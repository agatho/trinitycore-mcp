  class: Battleground
  method: GetWeakPtr
  signature: int Battleground::GetWeakPtr() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the weak pointer identifier for the battleground instance
  description: The GetWeakPtr method retrieves a unique integer identifier that represents
    the battleground's weak pointer reference. This identifier is used internally
    by the TrinityCore framework to track and manage battleground instances within
    the game world. The method provides a way to uniquely identify a battleground
    object without creating a strong reference, which helps prevent circular references
    and memory leaks in the system. This is particularly useful for managing battleground
    lifecycle and ensuring proper cleanup when battlegrounds are destroyed or removed
    from the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the weak pointer identifier of the battleground
    instance. This value serves as a unique reference to identify the battleground
    object within the framework's internal tracking systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to retrieve battleground weak pointer
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sBattlegroundMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      int weakPtr = bg->GetWeakPtr();

      printf("Battleground weak pointer: %d\n", weakPtr);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The weak pointer identifier returned by this method is not the same as the
    battleground's GUID. It's an internal reference used for framework-level object
    management and tracking. This value should not be used for direct object identification
    or comparison outside of the TrinityCore framework's internal systems.
  warnings: This method should only be called on valid battleground instances. Calling
    it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The returned integer value
    is only meaningful within the context of the TrinityCore framework and should
    not be persisted or used for external identification purposes.
