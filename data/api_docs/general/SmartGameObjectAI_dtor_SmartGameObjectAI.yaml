documentation:
  brief: Destroys a SmartGameObjectAI instance and performs necessary cleanup operations.
  description: The destructor for the SmartGameObjectAI class is responsible for cleaning
    up any resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes releasing
    memory, unregistering from event systems, and ensuring that all associated game
    object references are properly handled. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system,
    this method ensures that smart GameObjects do not leave behind dangling pointers
    or unmanaged resources when they are removed from the world. The destructor is
    automatically invoked when a SmartGameObjectAI object goes out of scope or is
    explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: void
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SmartGameObjectAI
    code: "void ExampleFunction()\n{\n    SmartGameObjectAI* ai = new SmartGameObjectAI();\n\
      \    // ... use the AI object ...\n    delete ai; // Destructor is automatically\
      \ called here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing object
    lifetime. It's important to ensure that all references to the GameObject associated
    with this AI are properly invalidated before destruction to prevent use-after-free
    errors.
  warnings: Directly calling the destructor on a SmartGameObjectAI instance can lead
    to undefined behavior if the object is still referenced elsewhere in the system.
    Always use proper memory management practices such as smart pointers or explicit
    deletion via 'delete'.
