documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AdaptiveDifficulty class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the AdaptiveDifficulty
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the adaptive difficulty system exists
    throughout the game server. This method is used to access the global adaptive
    difficulty configuration and behavior settings. The adaptive difficulty system
    adjusts the challenge level of instances based on the player group's average level
    and other factors to maintain an appropriate difficulty curve. This method should
    be called whenever access to the adaptive difficulty functionality is required,
    as it guarantees a consistent and unified system state across all parts of the
    TrinityCore server.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the single AdaptiveDifficulty instance, allowing direct
    access to its methods and properties without creating new objects
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Adaptive Difficulty Settings
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty& difficulty = AdaptiveDifficulty::Instance();

      uint32 avgLevel = difficulty.GetAveragePlayerLevel();

      uint32 adjustedDifficulty = difficulty.CalculateInstanceDifficulty();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Modifying Adaptive Difficulty Configuration
    code: 'AdaptiveDifficulty& diff = AdaptiveDifficulty::Instance();

      diff.SetDifficultyScalingFactor(1.5f);

      diff.EnableAdaptiveScaling(true);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the singleton pattern, so calling it multiple times will
    always return the same object reference. The instance is typically initialized
    during server startup and should not be manually destroyed. This implementation
    assumes thread safety for read operations, but write operations may require additional
    synchronization in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, modifying the returned instance affects all
    parts of the system that use it. Be cautious when changing configuration values
    as it can impact all instances across the server. Avoid calling this method during
    critical sections where thread safety is paramount without proper locking mechanisms.
