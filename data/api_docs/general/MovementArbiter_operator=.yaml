documentation:
  brief: Moves ownership of a MovementArbiter instance to another instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of a MovementArbiter
    object, transferring ownership of resources from the source object to the target
    object. This is typically used in scenarios where temporary or intermediate MovementArbiter
    objects need to be efficiently transferred without copying expensive internal
    state. The operation leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state,
    commonly an empty or default-constructed state. In the context of TrinityCore's
    movement system, this method supports efficient management of movement-related
    data structures during pathfinding and unit movement operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the target MovementArbiter object after the move assignment
    has been completed.
  examples:
  - title: Move Assignment Example
    code: 'MovementArbiter arbiter1;

      // ... initialize arbiter1 ...

      MovementArbiter arbiter2 = std::move(arbiter1); // Uses operator=

      // arbiter1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // arbiter2 contains the moved resources'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics, which is essential for performance
    optimization when dealing with objects that manage expensive resources. The source
    object after move assignment should not be used in a meaningful way until reinitialized.
