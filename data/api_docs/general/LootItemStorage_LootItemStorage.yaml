documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the LootItemStorage class for managing loot
    item data.
  description: The LootItemStorage constructor initializes a new instance of the LootItemStorage
    class, which is responsible for handling and storing loot item information within
    the TrinityCore framework. This class typically manages the collection of items
    that can be dropped by creatures or obtained through other game mechanics such
    as looting. The constructor sets up internal data structures necessary for tracking
    loot items, their quantities, and associated metadata. It prepares the storage
    container to receive loot data from various sources including creature drops,
    quest rewards, and other in-game loot generation systems.

  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LootItemStorage instance
    code: 'LootItemStorage storage;

      // The constructor is automatically called when declaring the object

      // storage now contains initialized loot item storage functionality'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method, so it should be called implicitly when creating
    an instance of the LootItemStorage class. Developers should be aware that this
    class likely manages memory internally and may have specific requirements for
    how loot items are added or retrieved after initialization.
