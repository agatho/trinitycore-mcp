documentation:
  brief: Updates terrain liquid status for the unit
  description: This method processes terrain status updates for a Unit, handling changes
    in liquid levels such as water or lava. It is responsible for updating the unit's
    position and state based on terrain data changes, particularly when the liquid
    status of surrounding environment changes. The method typically occurs during
    movement updates or when terrain data changes are detected.
  parameters:
  - name: oldLiquidStatus
    description: The previous liquid status of the terrain before update
  - name: newLiquidData
    description: Reference to new liquid data that has been updated, containing information
      about current liquid level and type
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit;

      unit->ProcessTerrainStatusUpdate(LIQUID_STATUS_WATER, newLiquidData);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during movement updates and requires proper
    synchronization of terrain data. Implementation may involve checking for changes
    in liquid level and updating unit's position accordingly.
  warnings: Care must be taken when handling liquid status updates as incorrect implementation
    can cause unit positioning issues or movement glitches. This method should only
    be called when terrain data is confirmed to have changed.
