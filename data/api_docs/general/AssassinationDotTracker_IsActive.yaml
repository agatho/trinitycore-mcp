  method: IsActive
  signature: bool AssassinationDotTracker::IsActive(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specified spell is currently active as a dot effect.
  description: The IsActive method determines whether a given spell ID corresponds
    to an active damage-over-time (DoT) effect within the Assassination specialization's
    tracking system. This functionality is crucial for managing combo point generation,
    spell interactions, and ensuring proper cooldown handling in assassination-based
    rogue gameplay. The method typically checks internal state tracking structures
    that maintain information about currently applied DoTs on targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID represents an active dot effect;
    otherwise returns false. This indicates whether the spell is currently ticking
    and applying damage over time to its target.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Rupture is Active
    code: "if (assassinationDotTracker->IsActive(1943)) {\n    // Rupture is currently\
      \ active on the target\n    // Handle combo point generation or other logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Combo Point Generation
    code: "if (!assassinationDotTracker->IsActive(2818) && !assassinationDotTracker->IsActive(1943))\
      \ {\n    // Neither Garrote nor Rupture is active\n    // Allow combo point\
      \ generation for other abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on internal tracking data structures that maintain
    a list or map of active DoT spell IDs. Performance is generally good as it's typically
    implemented with fast lookup mechanisms such as hash maps or bitfields. The implementation
    may be thread-safe depending on how the tracker class manages its state, but this
    should be verified in context of specific usage patterns.
  warnings: Ensure that spell IDs passed to this method are valid DoT spell IDs for
    the assassination specialization; passing incorrect IDs may lead to false negatives.
    Be aware that this method only checks active DoTs and does not account for other
    effects like bleed damage or periodic healing.
