  class: CalendarEvent
  method: SetDate
  signature: void CalendarEvent::SetDate(time_t date)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the date of the calendar event to the specified time value.
  description: The SetDate method updates the internal date timestamp of a CalendarEvent
    object with the provided time_t value. This method is typically used when creating
    or modifying calendar events within the TrinityCore framework, allowing developers
    to assign specific dates and times to events. The date parameter should represent
    a valid Unix timestamp, which corresponds to the number of seconds since January
    1, 1970. Setting an invalid or zero timestamp may result in unexpected behavior
    or display issues within the game's calendar interface.
  parameters:
  - name: date
    description: A time_t value representing the Unix timestamp for the event date
      and time. This should be a positive integer value corresponding to seconds since
      epoch (January 1, 1970). A value of 0 or negative numbers may cause undefined
      behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Event Date to Current Time
    code: "CalendarEvent event;\n time_t now = time(nullptr);\n event.SetDate(now);"
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Event Date to Specific Future Date
    code: "CalendarEvent event;\n struct tm future_date = {0};\n future_date.tm_year\
      \ = 2025 - 1900; // Year 2025\n future_date.tm_mon = 11;           // December\n\
      \ future_date.tm_mday = 25;         // 25th\n future_date.tm_hour = 18;    \
      \     // 6 PM\n future_date.tm_min = 0;\n future_date.tm_sec = 0;\n time_t timestamp\
      \ = mktime(&future_date);\nevent.SetDate(timestamp);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the CalendarEvent object.
    It is recommended to validate the input timestamp before calling this method to
    ensure it represents a meaningful date within the game's calendar system. The
    method does not perform any automatic validation or conversion of the timestamp
    value.
  warnings: Passing an invalid timestamp (e.g., negative values or extremely large
    numbers) may lead to incorrect display in the client or potential crashes. Ensure
    that the provided time_t value is valid and within acceptable ranges for the game's
    calendar system.
