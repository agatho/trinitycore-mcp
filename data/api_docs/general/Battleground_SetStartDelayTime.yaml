  class: Battleground
  method: SetStartDelayTime
  signature: void Battleground::SetStartDelayTime(int Time)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the start delay time for the battleground, determining how long players
    must wait before the match begins.
  description: The SetStartDelayTime method configures the initial countdown delay
    that occurs before a battleground session officially starts. This delay allows
    players to prepare, join the queue, and ensures all necessary setup is complete
    before combat begins. The time value is specified in milliseconds and affects
    the entire battleground instance. This method is typically invoked during battleground
    initialization or when adjusting match timing for specific game mechanics such
    as holiday events or special scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: Time
    description: The delay time in milliseconds before the battleground starts. Valid
      values are non-negative integers representing the duration of the pre-match
      waiting period.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a 30-second start delay
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->SetStartDelayTime(30000); // 30 seconds before match starts'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disabling start delay for immediate battle
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectAccessor->GetBattleground(67890);

      bg->SetStartDelayTime(0); // No delay, match starts immediately'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal start delay timer of the battleground
    instance. It should be called before the battleground is officially started to
    ensure proper timing. The delay value affects all players in the battleground
    and is used in conjunction with other timing-related methods such as GetStartDelayTime()
    and StartBattleground().
  warnings: Setting a very large delay time may cause synchronization issues or player
    disconnects if not handled properly. Ensure that the delay value is reasonable
    for gameplay balance and does not exceed system limits.
