  signature: void Channel::JoinChannel(Player * player, const std::string & pass)
documentation:
  brief: Joins a player to a channel with an optional password.
  description: The JoinChannel method adds a specified player to a channel, optionally
    validating a password if required. This method is typically invoked when a player
    attempts to join a chat channel, such as general, trade, or guild channels. It
    handles the logic for checking permissions, verifying passwords, and updating
    internal channel membership lists. The method ensures that players can only join
    channels they are authorized to access, based on channel settings and player permissions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object attempting to join the channel. Must
      be a valid player instance with an active session.
  - name: pass
    description: Optional password string required to join a protected channel. Empty
      string indicates no password is needed or the channel is public.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Join a public channel
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("General", player->GetTeam());

      channel->JoinChannel(player, "");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Join a password-protected channel
    code: 'Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel("Trade", player->GetTeam());

      channel->JoinChannel(player, "secret123");'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may trigger a network packet to notify other players in the channel
    of the new member. It's expected that the channel object has already been validated
    for existence and proper initialization before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player pointer or without ensuring
    the channel exists can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure the player is authenticated
    and the channel supports joining before invoking this method.
