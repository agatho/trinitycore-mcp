documentation:
  brief: Processes and applies trait configuration changes submitted by the player.
  description: The HandleTraitsCommitConfig method handles the commit of trait configurations
    sent from a client session. This method is typically invoked when a player finalizes
    their trait selections or modifications in the character customization interface.
    It validates the submitted trait data, applies the changes to the player's character,
    and ensures consistency with the game's trait system mechanics. The method operates
    within the WorldSession context, processing packets related to character traits
    and updating internal state accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Session Handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleTraitsCommitConfig(const WorldPackets::Traits::TraitsCommitConfig&\
      \ traitsCommitConfig)\n{\n    // Process the trait configuration commit\n  \
      \  _player->ApplyTraitConfig(traitsCommitConfig);\n    SendTraitConfigResult(TRAIT_CONFIG_SUCCESS);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the character customization system and should only
    be called during active player sessions. It assumes that the packet data has already
    been validated by the client-side trait system before being sent to the server.
  warnings: Improper handling of trait configurations can lead to inconsistent character
    states or invalid trait combinations. Ensure all trait data is properly validated
    before applying changes.
