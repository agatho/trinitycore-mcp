documentation:
  brief: Resets flight master statistics to their default values.
  description: The ResetStatistics method clears and reinitializes all flight master-related
    statistics within the FlightMasterManager. This includes resetting tracking data
    for player flight paths, clearing cached route information, and restoring default
    flight master states. The method is typically invoked during player logout, zone
    changes, or when flight master data needs to be refreshed. It ensures that subsequent
    flight path interactions start with clean state information without carrying over
    outdated or corrupted data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset flight master statistics for a player
    code: "void ResetPlayerFlightStats(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player && player->GetMotionMaster())\n\
      \    {\n        FlightMasterManager* fm = sWorld->GetFlightMasterManager();\n\
      \        if (fm)\n        {\n            fm->ResetStatistics();\n        }\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it may affect active flight path
    tracking for players. It is recommended to call this only during appropriate game
    state transitions such as player logout or zone change events.
