documentation:
  brief: Destroys an AreaTrigger instance and releases its associated resources.
  description: The AreaTrigger destructor is automatically invoked when an AreaTrigger
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of the area trigger's resources, including releasing memory allocated
    for the trigger's data structures and removing any references to the trigger within
    the game world. In TrinityCore, area triggers are used to define regions in the
    world that can activate events when players enter or exit them. The destructor
    performs necessary cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks and maintain the
    integrity of the game state. This method should not be called directly by developers
    unless implementing custom object management logic.

  - title: Automatic destruction of AreaTrigger
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    AreaTrigger* trigger = new AreaTrigger();\n\
      \    // ... use the trigger ...\n    delete trigger; // Destructor called here\n\
      }\n// Or alternatively, automatic destruction:\nAreaTrigger trigger; // Destructor\
      \ called when trigger goes out of scope"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when an object is
    destroyed. Developers should not manually invoke this destructor unless implementing
    custom memory management patterns. AreaTrigger objects are typically managed through
    smart pointers or container classes in TrinityCore, which handle destruction automatically.
