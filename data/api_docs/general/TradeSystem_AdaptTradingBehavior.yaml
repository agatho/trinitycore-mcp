  class: TradeSystem
  method: AdaptTradingBehavior
  signature: void TradeSystem::AdaptTradingBehavior(Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adapts trading behavior for the specified player based on their current trade
    state and system settings.
  description: The AdaptTradingBehavior method adjusts a player's trading behavior
    within the TrinityCore framework. It modifies how the player interacts with the
    trading system, potentially updating their trade window, adjusting item restrictions,
    or modifying trade rules based on in-game conditions such as player level, faction,
    or active quests. This method is typically invoked when a player initiates or
    modifies a trade to ensure that the trading mechanics align with current game
    state and server configuration. The behavior adaptation may include enabling/disabling
    certain trade features, applying trade cooldowns, or enforcing specific trading
    rules depending on the player's context.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Player* player = ...; // Get a valid player reference

      TradeSystem::AdaptTradingBehavior(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal trade state tracking and may be
    called automatically during trade initiation or modification. Developers should
    ensure that the player pointer is valid before calling this method to avoid undefined
    behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null player pointer will result in undefined
    behavior. Ensure proper validation of the player object before invoking this function.
