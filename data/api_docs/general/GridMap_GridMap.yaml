documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new GridMap instance with default values and prepares it for
    use in the game world.
  description: The GridMap constructor initializes a new grid map object, setting
    up internal data structures required for managing terrain, height information,
    and navigation data within a specific zone or map. This method is typically called
    during the server startup process or when loading a new map instance. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary memory is allocated and default values are set for
    map-related properties such as tile dimensions, height resolution, and grid boundaries.
    It also initializes internal state variables needed for efficient lookup and traversal
    operations during pathfinding and collision detection.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new GridMap instance
    code: 'GridMap* map = new GridMap();

      // The map is now initialized and ready for use

      // with terrain data and navigation information.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using GridMap in a map loading context
    code: "class MapManager\n{\npublic:\n    void LoadMap(int mapId)\n    {\n    \
      \    GridMap* newMap = new GridMap();\n        // Additional initialization\
      \ logic here\n        // Load terrain data, height maps, and navigation info\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: The GridMap constructor does not load actual map data - it only initializes
    the object structure. Actual map data loading occurs through separate methods
    like LoadMapData() or similar. This constructor is typically called internally
    by the TrinityCore framework and should not be invoked directly in most user code.
  warnings: Direct instantiation of GridMap objects should generally be avoided unless
    you are implementing custom map management logic. The normal workflow involves
    using the MapManager class to handle GridMap creation and initialization. Improper
    use of this constructor without proper context may lead to memory leaks or undefined
    behavior.
