documentation:
  brief: Sets the Unit's PvP flag status to enable or disable PvP behavior.
  description: The SetPvP method toggles the PvP flag status of a Unit, which determines
    whether the unit can engage in PvP combat. When enabled, the unit will be marked
    as PvP flagged and can participate in PvP battles, while disabling the flag removes
    this status. This method affects the unit's behavior in terms of PvP mechanics
    and is commonly used during player versus player encounters or when setting up
    player characters for PvP activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* target = new Unit();

      target->SetPvP(true);

      // Sets the unit to PvP enabled'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Unit* player = new Unit();

      player->SetPvP(false);

      // Sets the unit to PvP disabled

      // This prevents the player from engaging in PvP combat'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the unit's PvP flag status, which is crucial
    for game mechanics involving player versus player interactions. It should be used
    carefully as it impacts how the unit behaves in PvP scenarios and may influence
    other related flags or states.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in PvP situations,
    especially if the unit is not properly flagged or unflagged. Care should be taken
    when setting this flag for units that are not players, as it may affect their
    ability to engage in combat with other players or NPCs.
