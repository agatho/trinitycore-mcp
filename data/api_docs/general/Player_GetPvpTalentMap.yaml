  class: Player
  method: GetPvpTalentMap
  signature: PlayerPvpTalentMap & Player::GetPvpTalentMap(uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the PvP talent map for the specified spec.
  description: This method retrieves the PvP talent map associated with a specific
    player specialization. The returned reference allows access to the player's PvP
    talents and their current points allocated in each talent tree. This is essential
    for managing player progression in battlegrounds and arenas, particularly when
    handling talent resets or checking available talent points. The method ensures
    that the correct spec-specific talent map is returned, making it crucial for proper
    PvP gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to the PlayerPvpTalentMap structure which contains
    all PvP talents and their allocated points for the specified spec. This reference
    allows direct modification of the talent points and can be used for various PvP-related
    operations including talent resets and validation.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing PvP Talent Map
    code: 'PlayerPvpTalentMap& talentMap = player->GetPvpTalentMap(0); // Get primary
      spec talent map

      int points = talentMap.GetPoints();

      // Use the talentMap for further processing'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is designed to return a reference to avoid unnecessary copying
    of data structures. It should be used carefully as modifications to the returned
    reference affect the actual player's talent points. This method is typically called
    during PvP-related operations such as talent resets or when validating player
    talent choices.
  warnings: This method should not be called without proper context, as it may cause
    issues if used incorrectly in non-PvP scenarios. The returned reference must be
    handled with care to avoid invalid memory access or data corruption.
