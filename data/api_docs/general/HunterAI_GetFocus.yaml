  class: HunterAI
  method: GetFocus
  signature: int HunterAI::GetFocus() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the current focus value of the hunter AI.
  description: The GetFocus method returns the integer value representing the hunter's
    current focus level. In the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, focus
    is a resource used by hunters for certain abilities and spells. This value typically
    ranges from 0 to 100, though exact bounds may vary depending on game mechanics
    or modifications. The method is const, meaning it does not modify any internal
    state of the HunterAI object. It provides access to the focus state for use in
    decision-making logic within the AI behavior system.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the hunter's current focus level, typically ranging
    from 0 to 100.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int focus = hunterAI->GetFocus();\nif (focus >= 50) {\n    // Perform an\
      \ action that requires high focus\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Focus in AI Logic
    code: "void HunterAI::UpdateAI() {\n    int currentFocus = GetFocus();\n    if\
      \ (currentFocus >= 75 && !me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING)) {\n        DoCast(me,\
      \ SPELL_AIMED_SHOT);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system and should be used carefully in performance-sensitive
    contexts. The focus value may change dynamically during combat based on spell
    usage or other game events.
