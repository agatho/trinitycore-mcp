  class: BotSpawnEventBus
  method: ProcessEventsOfType
  signature: void BotSpawnEventBus::ProcessEventsOfType(BotSpawnEventType eventType)
documentation:
  brief: Processes all bot spawn events of the specified type in the event bus.
  description: The ProcessEventsOfType method iterates through all registered bot
    spawn events that match the provided event type and executes their associated
    handlers. This method is typically called during game loop processing to handle
    queued bot spawning operations. It ensures that events are processed in the correct
    order based on their registration time and handles any necessary cleanup after
    execution. The method does not return a value but modifies the state of the event
    bus by removing processed events.
  parameters:
  - name: eventType
    description: The type of bot spawn event to process. This parameter determines
      which events in the bus will be executed. Valid values are defined by the BotSpawnEventType
      enumeration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Process all bot spawn events
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;

      // Assume some events have been registered

      eventBus.ProcessEventsOfType(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_SPAWN);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Process specific type of bot spawn events
    code: 'BotSpawnEventBus eventBus;

      // Process only despawn events

      eventBus.ProcessEventsOfType(BotSpawnEventType::BOT_DESPAWN);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called from the main game thread to ensure thread safety.
    The event bus maintains a queue of events, and this method processes them sequentially.
    Performance may degrade if too many events are queued for processing at once.
  warnings: Calling this method while other threads are modifying the event queue
    can lead to race conditions. Always ensure proper synchronization when using this
    method in multi-threaded environments.
