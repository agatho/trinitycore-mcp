  method: RemoveFromWorld
  signature: void DynamicObject::RemoveFromWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Removes the dynamic object from the game world, making it no longer visible
    or interactable by players.
  description: The RemoveFromWorld method is responsible for removing a DynamicObject
    instance from the active game world. This function typically handles the cleanup
    of the object's presence in the server's world state, ensuring that it is no longer
    processed for updates, collisions, or player interactions. It may also trigger
    necessary cleanup routines such as removing references from spatial partitioning
    systems, notifying nearby players of the object's disappearance, and preparing
    the object for potential reuse or destruction. This method is commonly called
    when a spell effect or area aura expires, or when the dynamic object's duration
    has elapsed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Removing a Dynamic Object After Spell Effect
    code: "void HandleSpellEffect(Spell* spell)\n{\n    if (DynamicObject* dynObj\
      \ = spell->GetCaster()->GetDynObject(SPELL_ID))\n    {\n        dynObj->RemoveFromWorld();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on objects that are currently in the world.
    Calling it on an already removed object may result in undefined behavior or crashes.
    The object's memory is not freed by this call; it must be explicitly deleted if
    no longer needed.
  warnings: Never call RemoveFromWorld on a DynamicObject that has already been removed
    from the world, as this can lead to double-free errors or invalid memory access.
    Ensure that all references to the object are cleared before calling this method.
