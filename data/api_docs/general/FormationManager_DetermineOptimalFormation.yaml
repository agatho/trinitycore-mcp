  signature: FormationType FormationManager::DetermineOptimalFormation(const int &
    members)
documentation:
  brief: Determines the optimal formation type based on the number of members in a
    group.
  description: The DetermineOptimalFormation method evaluates the current number of
    group members and selects the most appropriate formation type for tactical positioning.
    This method is typically used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to
    dynamically adjust group formations during combat or movement scenarios. The selection
    logic considers factors such as group size, member roles, and encounter requirements
    to optimize team effectiveness. The method does not modify any internal state
    but returns a FormationType enum value that indicates the recommended formation
    strategy.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a FormationType enum value representing the optimal formation for
    the current group configuration. Possible values may include SINGLE_LINE, WIDE_SPREAD,
    DEFENSIVE_CIRCLE, or other formation types depending on implementation details
    and group size constraints.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'FormationManager manager;

      FormationType optimal = manager.DetermineOptimalFormation(5);

      // Returns the best formation type for a group of 5 members'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called during group initialization or when member counts
    change. It may cache results for performance optimization in frequently accessed
    scenarios. The actual formation logic should be implemented based on game balance
    requirements and encounter mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the members parameter represents a valid group size (typically
    positive integers). This method assumes that formation types are properly defined
    and available within the FormationManager's scope. Using invalid member counts
    may result in undefined behavior or incorrect formation selection.
