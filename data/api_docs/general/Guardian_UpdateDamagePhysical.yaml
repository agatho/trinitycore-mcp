  class: Guardian
  method: UpdateDamagePhysical
  signature: void Guardian::UpdateDamagePhysical(int attType)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the physical damage statistics for the guardian based on the specified
    attack type.
  description: The UpdateDamagePhysical method recalculates and applies physical damage
    values for a Guardian unit, adjusting its attack power and damage output according
    to the provided attack type. This method is typically invoked during combat updates
    or when the guardian's weapon or stats change. It ensures that the guardian's
    physical attacks reflect current game mechanics such as weapon damage scaling,
    stat modifiers, and attack type-specific adjustments. The method does not directly
    perform damage calculations but rather prepares the internal state for subsequent
    damage application.
  parameters:
  - name: attType
    description: Specifies the attack type that determines how physical damage is
      calculated. Valid values are typically defined by game constants such as ATTACK_TYPE_NORMAL,
      ATTACK_TYPE_OFFHAND, or ATTACK_TYPE_RANGED.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update damage for normal attack
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      guardian->UpdateDamagePhysical(ATTACK_TYPE_NORMAL);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update damage for off-hand attack
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      guardian->UpdateDamagePhysical(ATTACK_TYPE_OFFHAND);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the guardian's equipment or stats
    have changed, as it recalculates damage values. It is often used internally by
    the combat system and may not need to be called directly in most custom scripts.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper context can lead to inconsistent damage
    calculations. Ensure that all relevant stat changes are applied before calling
    this function.
