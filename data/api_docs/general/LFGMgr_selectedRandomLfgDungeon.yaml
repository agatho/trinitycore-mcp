  signature: bool LFGMgr::selectedRandomLfgDungeon(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Selects a random LFG dungeon for the given player GUID.
  description: The selectedRandomLfgDungeon method is responsible for choosing a random
    dungeon from the available LFG (Looking For Group) dungeons for a specified player.
    This method typically integrates with the TrinityCore's LFG system to assign a
    dungeon based on player level, faction, and other relevant criteria. It ensures
    that players are matched with appropriate dungeon content according to game mechanics
    and player preferences. The method is commonly used during group formation or
    when players are looking for random dungeon matches.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player for whom a random LFG
      dungeon should be selected.
  returns: Returns true if a valid random dungeon was successfully selected and assigned
    to the player, false otherwise. This may occur if no suitable dungeons are available
    or if the player GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Selecting a Random LFG Dungeon for a Player
    code: "uint64 playerGuid = 123456;\nbool success = sLFGMgr->selectedRandomLfgDungeon(playerGuid);\n\
      if (success)\n{\n    // Dungeon successfully selected\n    printf(\"Random dungeon\
      \ assigned to player %llu\\n\", playerGuid);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to assign\
      \ dungeon\n    printf(\"Failed to assign random dungeon to player %llu\\n\"\
      , playerGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal LFG queues and dungeon selection
    logic. It may be called during player login, group creation, or when a player
    explicitly requests a random dungeon match. The actual dungeon assignment process
    involves checking player eligibility, faction matching, and available dungeon
    slots.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided GUID is valid before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior. This method might not be thread-safe if called concurrently
    from multiple threads without proper synchronization.
