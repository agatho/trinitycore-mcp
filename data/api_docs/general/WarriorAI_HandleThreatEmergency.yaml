  brief: Handles emergency threat management for warrior AI during combat situations
  description: The HandleThreatEmergency method is responsible for managing critical
    threat scenarios in the WarriorAI class, typically invoked when the warrior's
    threat level becomes dangerously high or when emergency combat conditions arise.
    This method evaluates the current threat situation, potentially triggers defensive
    abilities, and adjusts the AI's combat behavior to prevent the warrior from being
    overwhelmed by enemies. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the warrior's survivability
    during intense combat encounters by dynamically responding to rapidly changing
    threat levels.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage within combat loop
    code: "void WarriorAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim() && me->GetThreatManager().GetThreat(me->GetVictim())\
      \ > 10000)\n    {\n        HandleThreatEmergency();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active combat situations where threat
    management is critical. The implementation likely involves checking current threat
    levels against predefined thresholds and executing appropriate emergency actions
    such as using defensive cooldowns or repositioning.
  warnings: Improper invocation of this method outside of combat conditions may cause
    unexpected behavior or performance issues. Developers should ensure that threat
    level checks are properly validated before calling this method to avoid unnecessary
    processing.
