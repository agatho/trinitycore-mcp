  signature: double BotPerformanceAnalytics::CalculateTrendScore(const std::vector<double>
    & values) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a trend score based on a vector of double values representing
    performance metrics.
  description: The CalculateTrendScore method computes a normalized trend score from
    a sequence of numerical values, typically used to evaluate performance patterns
    over time. It analyzes the input data to determine whether the values are generally
    increasing, decreasing, or stable. This method is commonly employed in bot analytics
    to assess how well a bot's performance metrics (such as efficiency, response times,
    or success rates) are trending. The calculation considers the direction and magnitude
    of changes between consecutive data points to produce a single double value that
    represents the overall trend strength and direction.
  parameters: []
  returns: A double value representing the calculated trend score. Positive values
    indicate an upward trend, negative values indicate a downward trend, and values
    near zero suggest a stable or neutral trend. The magnitude of the value reflects
    the strength of the trend.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'std::vector<double> performanceData = {10.5, 12.3, 14.1, 16.7, 18.2};

      BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      double trendScore = analytics.CalculateTrendScore(performanceData);

      // Returns a positive value indicating upward trend'
    language: cpp
  - title: Evaluating Stability
    code: 'std::vector<double> stableData = {10.0, 10.2, 9.8, 10.1, 9.9};

      BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      double trendScore = analytics.CalculateTrendScore(stableData);

      // Returns a value near zero indicating stable performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input vector contains at least two elements
    for meaningful trend calculation. If fewer than two values are provided, the behavior
    is undefined and may result in an invalid return value or exception. The implementation
    uses a simple linear regression approach to determine the trend direction and
    strength.
  warnings: Ensure that the input data represents consistent time-series measurements
    for accurate trend analysis. Using unrelated or inconsistent data points can lead
    to misleading results. Avoid passing empty vectors or vectors with insufficient
    data points.
