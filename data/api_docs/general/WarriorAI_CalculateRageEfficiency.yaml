  class: WarriorAI
  method: CalculateRageEfficiency
  signature: float WarriorAI::CalculateRageEfficiency()
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the efficiency rating of rage generation for the warrior
    AI.
  description: The CalculateRageEfficiency method computes a float value representing
    how effectively the warrior AI is generating rage during combat. This calculation
    typically takes into account various factors such as attack frequency, ability
    usage, and damage dealt to determine an overall rage efficiency score. The result
    is used by the AI system to make decisions about which abilities to prioritize
    when managing rage resources. The method does not require any parameters and operates
    on the current state of the warrior's combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the efficiency of rage generation,
    where 0.0 indicates no rage efficiency and 1.0 represents maximum possible rage
    efficiency based on the AI's current performance metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float efficiency = warriorAI->CalculateRageEfficiency();\nif (efficiency\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    // Warrior is generating rage very efficiently\n    // Consider\
      \ using high-rage abilities\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: AI Decision Making
    code: "float efficiency = warriorAI->CalculateRageEfficiency();\nif (efficiency\
      \ < 0.5f) {\n    // Low rage efficiency, prioritize rage-generating abilities\n\
      \    if (player->HasSpell(12345)) // Example rage ability\n        player->CastSpell(target,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called periodically during combat to evaluate the AI's
    performance and adjust strategy accordingly. The exact calculation logic may vary
    based on the warrior's specialization (Arms, Fury, Protection) and current gear
    state.
  warnings: The returned value should not be used as an absolute measure of performance
    but rather as a relative indicator for decision-making within the AI system. Changes
    in combat conditions or spell effects may affect the calculation results.
