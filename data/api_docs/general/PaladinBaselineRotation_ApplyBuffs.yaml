documentation:
  brief: Applies buffs to the bot player based on baseline paladin rotation logic.
  description: The ApplyBuffs method is responsible for determining and applying appropriate
    buffs to a bot player within the context of a paladin baseline rotation. This
    method evaluates the current state of the bot, including available spells, cooldowns,
    and resource levels, to decide which buffs should be applied. It typically handles
    self-buffs such as Blessing of Might, Blessing of Wisdom, or other applicable
    paladin auras that enhance the bot's combat effectiveness. The method operates
    within the broader framework of TrinityCore's AI system for class-specific rotations
    and is designed to optimize the bot's performance in both PvE and PvP scenarios.

    code: 'PaladinBaselineRotation rotation;

      int bot = 12345; // Example bot ID

      rotation.ApplyBuffs(&bot);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Paladin baseline AI logic and assumes that the
    bot has been initialized with proper spell data and that the player state is valid.
    It may interact with other methods in the rotation class to determine buff priorities
    and timing.
