documentation:
  brief: Returns the battleground queue index for a specific battleground type.
  description: This method retrieves the queue index associated with a specific battleground
    type ID, allowing players to determine their position in a battleground queue.
    The method is used internally by TrinityCore to manage player queue positions
    and can be useful for determining which battleground a player is queued for. It
    returns a uint32 value representing the queue index, or 0 if the player is not
    queued for that specific battleground type.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the queue index for the specified battleground
    type ID. A value of 0 indicates the player is not queued for that battleground
    type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: uint32 queueIndex = player->GetBattlegroundQueueIndex(1); // Get queue index
      for Alterac Valley
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other battleground-related
    methods to manage player queue states and can be critical for determining queue
    positions during battleground matchmaking.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method as it may return 0 if the player is
    not queued for a specific battleground type, which could lead to incorrect assumptions
    about player status in queues.
