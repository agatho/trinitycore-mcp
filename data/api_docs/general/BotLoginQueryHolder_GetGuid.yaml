  signature: int BotLoginQueryHolder::GetGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot login query holder.
  description: The GetGuid method returns the unique identifier associated with a
    specific bot login query holder instance. This GUID is typically used to distinguish
    between different bot login operations within the TrinityCore framework. The method
    is designed to be a read-only accessor that provides immutable access to the internal
    GUID value stored in the object. It serves as part of the bot management system,
    allowing systems to identify and track individual bot login requests or sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot login query
    holder instance. This value is typically a positive integer used for internal
    tracking and identification purposes within the TrinityCore database or memory
    structures.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLoginQueryHolder queryHolder;

      int guid = queryHolder.GetGuid();

      // guid now contains the unique identifier of this query holder instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented as a simple getter that returns a cached
    or stored GUID value. Since it's marked as const, it does not modify any internal
    state of the object and can be safely called from any context where the object
    is accessible.
