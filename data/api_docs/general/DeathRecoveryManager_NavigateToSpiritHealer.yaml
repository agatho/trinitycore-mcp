documentation:
  brief: Initiates navigation to the nearest spirit healer for a player who has died.
  description: The NavigateToSpiritHealer method is responsible for finding and initiating
    movement toward the closest spirit healer location for a player who has recently
    died. This method typically gets invoked during the death recovery process in
    TrinityCore, allowing players to be automatically transported to the appropriate
    resurrection point. It handles the logic of locating the nearest spirit healer
    based on the player's current zone and faction, then begins the movement pathfinding
    process to reach that location. The method returns true if navigation was successfully
    initiated, or false if no suitable spirit healer could be found or if the player
    is already in the process of being resurrected.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if navigation to the spirit healer was successfully initiated,
    false otherwise. A return value of false may indicate that no spirit healer exists
    in the current zone, the player is already being resurrected, or an error occurred
    during pathfinding.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in death recovery
    code: "if (deathRecoveryManager.NavigateToSpiritHealer()) {\n    // Player navigation\
      \ to spirit healer initiated successfully\n    sLog->outString(\"Player navigation\
      \ to spirit healer started.\");\n} else {\n    // Failed to initiate navigation\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to navigate player to spirit healer.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the death recovery sequence after
    a player's corpse has been processed. It relies on the game's internal spirit
    healer database and pathfinding system. The method does not guarantee immediate
    arrival at the spirit healer, but rather initiates the movement process which
    may involve teleportation or walking depending on the zone and server configuration.
  warnings: This method should only be called when a player is in the death recovery
    state. Calling it outside of this context may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
    Additionally, if multiple players are dying simultaneously in the same area, there
    could be performance implications due to pathfinding calculations.
