  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateQuestAcceptance
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateQuestAcceptance(uint32 questId, Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Validates whether a player can accept a specified quest based on game rules
    and requirements.
  description: The ValidateQuestAcceptance method checks if a given player meets all
    necessary conditions to accept a specific quest in the World of Warcraft game.
    It evaluates various factors such as quest prerequisites, player level, completed
    quest dependencies, faction requirements, and other game-specific constraints.
    This validation ensures that players cannot accept quests they are not qualified
    for, maintaining game balance and progression integrity. The method returns true
    if all validations pass, indicating the quest can be accepted by the player; otherwise,
    it returns false.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to validate for acceptance. Must
      correspond to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player attempting to
      accept the quest. Cannot be null.
  returns: True if the player can accept the specified quest, false otherwise. Returns
    false if any validation check fails, such as level requirements not met, prerequisites
    unfulfilled, or faction restrictions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Acceptance Validation
    code: "if (QuestValidation::ValidateQuestAcceptance(12345, player)) {\n    //\
      \ Proceed with quest acceptance logic\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Inform player they cannot accept the quest\n    player->SendNotification(\"\
      You do not meet the requirements to accept this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Quest Acceptance Flow
    code: "void Player::OnQuestAccept(uint32 questId) {\n    if (!QuestValidation::ValidateQuestAcceptance(questId,\
      \ this)) {\n        SendQuestInvalidReason(QUEST_INVALID_REASON_NOT_ENOUGH_MONEY);\n\
      \        return;\n    }\n    // Continue with normal quest acceptance flow\n\
      \    AcceptQuest(questId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database lookups and checks against player state, so
    it may have performance implications if called frequently. It's recommended to
    cache validation results where possible for repeated checks. The method assumes
    the player object is fully initialized with current quest data and status.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid or uninitialized player object will result in undefined
    behavior. Additionally, this method does not modify the player's state directly;
    it only validates whether acceptance would be allowed.
