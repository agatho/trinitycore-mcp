  method: DetectGuildCliques
  signature: void GuildIntegration::DetectGuildCliques(uint32 guildId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes guild membership data to identify potential cliques or tightly-knit
    groups of players within a specified guild.
  description: The DetectGuildCliques method scans through all members of the specified
    guild and evaluates their interaction patterns, friendship relationships, and
    shared activities to detect clusters of players who form tight social groups or
    cliques. This functionality is typically used for game balance purposes, player
    behavior analysis, or identifying potential issues such as griefing groups. The
    method does not modify any data but rather processes existing guild member information
    to generate insights about group dynamics. It requires that the guild exists and
    has members before execution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Detect cliques in a specific guild
    code: 'GuildIntegration guildIntegration;

      guildIntegration.DetectGuildCliques(12345);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs computationally intensive analysis on guild membership
    data and may have performance implications for large guilds. It should be called
    during off-peak hours or asynchronously to avoid impacting gameplay experience.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an existing guild; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. This function does
    not perform any modifications to the database but relies on read-only access to
    guild data.
