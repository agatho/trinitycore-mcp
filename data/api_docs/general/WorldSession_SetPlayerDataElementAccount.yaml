  class: WorldSession
  method: SetPlayerDataElementAccount
  signature: void WorldSession::SetPlayerDataElementAccount(uint32 dataElementId,
    int64 value)
documentation:
  brief: Sets an account-wide player data element value for the current session's
    player.
  description: This method updates a specific account-wide player data element identified
    by the provided ID with the given integer value. It is typically used to store
    persistent player information that should be accessible across different characters
    or sessions within the same account. The data element ID corresponds to predefined
    constants in the TrinityCore system, and the value is stored in the database for
    persistence. This method does not directly modify the player's in-memory state
    but rather updates the underlying account data structure.
  parameters:
  - name: dataElementId
    description: The unique identifier of the player data element to set. Must correspond
      to a valid predefined data element constant defined in the TrinityCore codebase.
  - name: value
    description: The integer64 value to assign to the specified data element. Can
      be any signed 64-bit integer value, including negative numbers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a player's last login timestamp
    code: 'int64 currentTime = time(nullptr);

      worldSession->SetPlayerDataElementAccount(PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_LAST_LOGIN_TIME,
      currentTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating account-wide achievement progress
    code: 'int64 newProgress = GetAchievementProgress() + 100;

      worldSession->SetPlayerDataElementAccount(PLAYER_DATA_ELEMENT_ACHIEVEMENT_PROGRESS,
      newProgress);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely triggers an asynchronous database update operation. The
    actual data persistence may be deferred until the next database sync cycle or
    when the session is closed. Ensure that the dataElementId parameter corresponds
    to a valid element defined in the player data system.
  warnings: Incorrect dataElementId values may result in silent failures or undefined
    behavior. This method should not be called with invalid or uninitialized data
    element IDs. Be cautious when updating frequently changing data elements as it
    could impact performance.
