  method: UpdateCharacterArenaTeamId
  signature: void CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterArenaTeamId(const int & guid, uint8
    slot, uint32 arenaTeamId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the arena team ID associated with a character for a specific slot
    in the character cache.
  description: The UpdateCharacterArenaTeamId method updates the arena team identifier
    (arenaTeamId) stored for a given character identified by their GUID in a specified
    slot within the character cache. This method is typically used to synchronize
    or modify a character's arena team membership information, which may be required
    when a player joins or leaves an arena team, or when team data is refreshed from
    the database. The slot parameter determines which of the character's arena team
    slots (e.g., 2v2, 3v3, 5v5) is being updated. This method operates on cached data
    and does not directly interact with the database; changes are expected to be persisted
    separately if needed.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the character whose arena
      team information is being updated. This value must correspond to a valid character
      in the game world.
  - name: slot
    description: The arena team slot index indicating which type of arena team (2v2,
      3v3, or 5v5) is being modified. Valid values are typically 0, 1, and 2 representing
      the different arena bracket slots.
  - name: arenaTeamId
    description: The unique identifier of the arena team that the character belongs
      to in the specified slot. A value of 0 indicates the character is not part of
      any arena team for that slot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Update a character's 3v3 arena team ID
    code: 'CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterArenaTeamId(123456, 1, 7890);

      // Updates the character with GUID 123456 to be part of arena team 7890 in their
      3v3 slot.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove a character from an arena team
    code: 'CharacterCache::UpdateCharacterArenaTeamId(123456, 2, 0);

      // Removes the character with GUID 123456 from their 5v5 arena team by setting
      the ID to 0.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method updates only the in-memory cache and does not persist changes
    to the database. It is important that any persistent storage updates are handled
    separately, typically through database queries or other caching mechanisms. The
    slot parameter should be validated against known arena team types to prevent invalid
    data from being stored.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the slot value can result in updating the wrong arena
    team slot, leading to inconsistent character data. Ensure that the arenaTeamId
    is valid and corresponds to an existing arena team in the game world. Setting
    an invalid or non-existent arenaTeamId may cause issues during gameplay or when
    retrieving team information.
