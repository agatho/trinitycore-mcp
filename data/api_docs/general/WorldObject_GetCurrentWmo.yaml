documentation:
  brief: Returns the current Wmo (World Model Object) identifier for the WorldObject.
  description: The GetCurrentWmo method retrieves the unique identifier of the current
    World Model Object that the WorldObject is associated with. This method is typically
    used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework to determine
    which WMO (World Model Object) a given object belongs to, particularly when dealing
    with dynamic world objects or terrain features. The returned value represents
    the Wmo ID which can be used for various game mechanics such as determining collision
    properties, visual representation, or interaction with environment objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an integer representing the current Wmo identifier.
    This value is typically used to identify specific World Model Objects within the
    game world and may be null if no Wmo is currently associated with the object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int wmoId = *worldObject->GetCurrentWmo();\nif (wmoId != 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Process the Wmo ID\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No Wmo is currently active\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the WorldObject class and may be used in conjunction
    with other Wmo-related methods to manage dynamic world objects. Performance considerations
    include avoiding unnecessary calls to this method when the Wmo ID remains constant
    during a session.
