  class: Player
  method: SetSkillTempBonus
  signature: void Player::SetSkillTempBonus(uint32 pos, uint16 bonus)
documentation:
  brief: Sets a temporary bonus for a specific skill level in the player's skill list.
  description: This method allows developers to modify the temporary bonus value associated
    with a particular skill position in the player's skill list. The skill position
    is typically determined by the index of the skill within the player's skill table,
    and the bonus represents an additional value that can be applied to the skill
    level. This functionality is useful for implementing game mechanics such as temporary
    skill boosts, buffs, or modifications to skill progression during gameplay events.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The zero-based index position of the skill within the player's skill
      list. This determines which skill the bonus applies to.
  - name: bonus
    description: The temporary bonus value to be applied to the specified skill position.
      This value is typically a positive integer that modifies the skill level.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Apply temporary skill bonus
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetSkillTempBonus(0, 50);

      // Applies a +50 bonus to the first skill in the list'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other skill-related methods
    and should be called carefully to avoid unintended side effects. The bonus value
    is usually applied during gameplay and may not persist across server resets or
    reloads.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can cause incorrect skill calculations, potentially
    leading to game imbalance or unexpected behavior when the skill is re-evaluated.
    Care should be taken to ensure that the bonus values are within valid ranges for
    the skill being modified.
