documentation:
  brief: Selects implicit line targets for spell effects based on target type and
    index
  description: This method handles the selection of implicit line targets for spell
    effects, determining which targets are valid for a given spell effect based on
    the target type and index. It processes the spell effect information and target
    type to determine appropriate targets for line-based spells, typically used in
    spell casting mechanics where multiple targets need to be selected for a single
    spell effect. The method operates within the context of TrinityCore's spell system
    and handles target selection for various spell effects including those involving
    line targeting.
  parameters:
  - name: spellEffectInfo
    description: Contains information about the spell effect being processed, including
      effect type, radius, and other relevant parameters
  - name: targetType
    description: The implicit target type information that defines how targets should
      be selected for this spell effect
  - name: targetIndex
    description: The index of the target being processed, determining which specific
      target within a group to select
  - name: effMask
    description: The effect mask indicating which effects are being processed, used
      to determine which targets should be selected
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic spell target selection example
    code: 'Spell::SelectImplicitLineTargets(spellEffectInfo, targetType, targetIndex,
      effMask);

      // This method is typically called during spell casting process'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell target selection system and should be used
    in conjunction with other spell target selection methods. The method may be called
    multiple times during a spell's execution depending on the number of targets needed.
    Implementation details include handling of target type information and effect
    mask processing.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code without proper
    context, as it is part of the internal spell system. Incorrect usage can lead
    to invalid target selection or failed spell casting.
