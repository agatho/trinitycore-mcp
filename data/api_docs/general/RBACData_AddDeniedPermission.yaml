  method: AddDeniedPermission
  signature: void RBACData::AddDeniedPermission(uint32 permissionId)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a denied permission ID to the RBAC data structure for player access
    control.
  description: The AddDeniedPermission method adds a specified permission ID to the
    internal list of denied permissions within the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
    data structure. This method is used in TrinityCore's authentication and authorization
    system to define which permissions are explicitly forbidden for a given account
    or character. The denied permissions take precedence over granted ones, ensuring
    that even if a user has been granted access to a specific feature, they will be
    denied access if that permission is listed in the denied set. This mechanism supports
    fine-grained control over player privileges and is integral to the game's security
    model.
  parameters:
  - name: permissionId
    description: The unique identifier of the permission to deny. This ID corresponds
      to a specific permission node defined in the TrinityCore permission system,
      such as 'rbac_permission_1', 'rbac_permission_2', etc.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Deny a specific permission for an account
    code: 'RBACData rbacData;

      rbacData.AddDeniedPermission(1005); // Deny access to the ''teleport'' permission

      rbacData.AddDeniedPermission(2001); // Deny access to the ''gm_ticket'' permission'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding multiple denied permissions in a loop
    code: "RBACData rbacData;\nstd::vector<uint32> deniedPermissions = {1005, 2001,\
      \ 3007};\nfor (uint32 permId : deniedPermissions)\n{\n    rbacData.AddDeniedPermission(permId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal state of the RBACData object. It is typically
    used during account or character initialization, or when updating access permissions
    dynamically. The permission IDs must be valid and defined within the TrinityCore
    permission system; otherwise, the behavior may be undefined.
  warnings: Adding a permission ID that does not exist in the permission tree can
    lead to unexpected behavior or errors during access checks. Always validate permission
    IDs against the known permission list before calling this method.
