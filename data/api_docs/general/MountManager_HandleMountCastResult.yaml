  method: HandleMountCastResult
  signature: void MountManager::HandleMountCastResult(int * player, uint32 spellId,
    bool success)
documentation:
  brief: Processes the result of a mount spell cast attempt, updating player state
    and handling success or failure conditions.
  description: The HandleMountCastResult method is responsible for processing the
    outcome of a player's attempt to cast a mount spell. It takes the player reference,
    spell identifier, and success status as inputs, then updates the player's mount
    state accordingly. This method ensures that appropriate actions are taken whether
    the mount spell succeeds or fails, such as displaying feedback messages, updating
    the player's mount inventory, or triggering related game mechanics like cooldowns
    or achievement tracking. The method is typically invoked by the core game loop
    after a mount spell has been processed and its result determined.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the player object attempting to cast the mount spell.
      This parameter represents the target of the mount action and is used to update
      player state and send relevant messages.
  - name: spellId
    description: Unique identifier for the mount spell being cast. This value determines
      which specific mount effect should be applied or rejected based on the success
      status.
  - name: success
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the mount spell cast was successful.
      True indicates the mount was successfully summoned, false indicates failure
      due to various conditions like cooldowns, restrictions, or invalid targets.
  returns: null

    code: "void example() {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\n \
      \   uint32 spellId = 34090; // Example mount spell ID\n    bool success = true;\
      \ // Assume successful cast\n    \n    MountManager::HandleMountCastResult(player,\
      \ spellId, success);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Failed Mount Cast
    code: "void handleFailedMount() {\n    Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\n\
      \    uint32 spellId = 34090; // Example mount spell ID\n    bool success = false;\
      \ // Assume failed cast\n    \n    MountManager::HandleMountCastResult(player,\
      \ spellId, success);\n    // This would trigger cooldown display or error message\
      \ to player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the mount system's core logic and integrates with
    TrinityCore's spell handling framework. It assumes that the player object is valid
    and properly initialized. The method may interact with other subsystems such as
    cooldown management, achievement tracking, and client communication to ensure
    proper game state synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer passed is not null before calling this
    method. Passing an invalid player reference could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. Also, be aware that this method might trigger additional network messages
    to the client, so performance considerations should be taken into account when
    calling it frequently.
