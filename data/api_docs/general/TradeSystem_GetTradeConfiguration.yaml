api:
  class: TradeSystem
  method: GetTradeConfiguration
  signature: TradeConfiguration TradeSystem::GetTradeConfiguration(uint32 playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the trade configuration settings for a specified player by their
    GUID.
  description: The GetTradeConfiguration method fetches the trade-related settings
    and restrictions for a given player identified by their unique game identifier
    (GUID). This function is typically used within the trading system to determine
    allowable trade behaviors, such as maximum item count, allowed item types, or
    trade cooldowns. The returned TradeConfiguration object encapsulates all relevant
    parameters that define how a specific player can engage in trading activities.
    It's important to note that this method may involve database lookups or cached
    data retrieval depending on the implementation strategy.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique global identifier (GUID) of the player whose trade configuration
      is being retrieved. This value must correspond to a valid player in the game
      database.
  returns: A TradeConfiguration object containing all relevant trade settings for
    the specified player, including limits, restrictions, and behavior parameters.
    Returns an empty or default-initialized configuration if no specific settings
    are found for the player.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nTradeConfiguration config = tradeSystem.GetTradeConfiguration(playerId);\n\
      if (config.IsValid()) {\n    // Process trade configuration\n    uint32 maxItems\
      \ = config.GetMaxTradeItems();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "uint32 playerId = 12345;\nTradeConfiguration config = tradeSystem.GetTradeConfiguration(playerId);\n\
      if (config.IsValid()) {\n    // Apply trade rules\n    if (config.IsTradeAllowed())\
      \ {\n        // Proceed with trade logic\n    }\n} else {\n    // Fallback to\
      \ default settings\n    LOG_ERROR(\"trade\", \"Failed to retrieve trade configuration\
      \ for player {}\", playerId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform database queries or access cached configurations
    depending on the system's implementation. For performance-critical applications,
    consider caching results locally where appropriate. The TradeConfiguration object
    returned should be treated as immutable to prevent unintended side effects during
    trade processing.
  warnings: Ensure that the playerGuid parameter is validated before calling this
    method to avoid invalid database lookups or unexpected behavior. If a player does
    not have any specific trade configuration defined, the method may return a default
    configuration which might differ from expected values in certain edge cases.
