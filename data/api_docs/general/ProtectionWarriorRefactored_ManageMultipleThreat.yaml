documentation:
  brief: Manages threat generation and distribution for multiple targets in a Protection
    Warrior's combat routine.
  description: The ManageMultipleThreat method handles the core logic for how a Protection
    Warrior generates and distributes threat across multiple enemies during combat.
    This includes determining which targets to apply threat to, calculating appropriate
    threat values based on abilities used, and ensuring proper threat management to
    maintain aggro on priority targets. The method integrates with the warrior's defensive
    cooldowns, taunts, and threat-generating abilities to optimize tanking performance
    in multi-target scenarios. It ensures that the warrior maintains control over
    all nearby enemies while avoiding unnecessary threat spikes that could cause threat
    loss.

  - title: Basic Threat Management Call
    code: "void UpdateAI(uint32 diff) override\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n   \
      \ {\n        // Other combat logic...\n        _warrior->ManageMultipleThreat();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat to maintain optimal
    threat distribution. It assumes the warrior has multiple targets within range
    and that threat management is active. The implementation may adjust based on the
    number of enemies present and the warrior's current threat state.
  warnings: Improper use or omission of this method can lead to loss of aggro on important
    targets, potentially causing friendly fire incidents or enemy deaths due to lack
    of proper tanking. Ensure all combat logic properly integrates with this method
    for optimal performance.
