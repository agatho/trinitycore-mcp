  method: AddToWorld
  signature: void Corpse::AddToWorld()
documentation:
  brief: Adds the corpse object to the game world environment, making it visible and
    interactive to players.
  description: The AddToWorld method integrates a Corpse object into the active game
    world by registering it with the appropriate map manager and spatial partitioning
    systems. This allows the corpse to be rendered, interacted with by players (e.g.,
    looting), and managed by the server's object tracking systems. The method typically
    gets called during the initialization or spawning of a corpse after a player has
    died. It ensures that the corpse is properly linked into the game world's data
    structures so that it can be processed by various subsystems such as movement
    detection, visibility calculations, and object cleanup routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in corpse creation
    code: 'Corpse* corpse = new Corpse();

      corpse->Create(playerGuid, mapId, position);

      // ... set corpse data ...

      corpse->AddToWorld();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per corpse instance. Calling it multiple
    times may result in undefined behavior or duplicate entries in the world manager.
    The method assumes that all necessary initialization has already occurred on the
    corpse object, including setting its GUID, position, and associated data.
  warnings: Do not call AddToWorld on a corpse that has already been added to the
    world; doing so can cause memory corruption or double-free errors. Also, ensure
    that the corpse's map and position are valid before calling this method, as invalid
    coordinates may lead to issues with spatial partitioning.
