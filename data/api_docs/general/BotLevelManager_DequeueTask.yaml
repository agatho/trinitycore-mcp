documentation:
  brief: Removes and returns the next bot creation task from the queue
  description: The DequeueTask method retrieves and removes the next available bot
    creation task from an internal queue. This method is typically used by the bot
    management system to process tasks in a first-in-first-out manner. The returned
    task contains all necessary information for creating a new bot, including level
    requirements, class selection, and other configuration parameters. If the queue
    is empty, the method will return a null shared pointer. This operation is thread-safe
    and designed to prevent race conditions during concurrent bot creation processes.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<BotCreationTask> pointing to the next task in the queue,
    or a null pointer if the queue is empty
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DequeueTask
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotCreationTask> task = botLevelManager->DequeueTask();\n\
      if (task)\n{\n    // Process the bot creation task\n    task->Execute();\n}\n\
      else\n{\n    // No tasks available\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"No bot creation\
      \ tasks in queue\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using DequeueTask in a loop to process all pending tasks
    code: "while (true)\n{\n    std::shared_ptr<BotCreationTask> task = botLevelManager->DequeueTask();\n\
      \    if (!task)\n        break;\n    \n    // Execute the task\n    if (task->Validate())\n\
      \    {\n        task->Execute();\n        LOG_DEBUG(\"bot\", \"Executed bot\
      \ creation task for level {}\", task->GetTargetLevel());\n    }\n    else\n\
      \    {\n        LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Invalid bot creation task encountered\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from multiple
    threads concurrently. The internal queue implementation ensures that tasks are
    processed in order without duplication. The returned task object remains valid
    until explicitly destroyed or replaced by another call to DequeueTask.
  warnings: Calling this method on an empty queue will return a null pointer, which
    must be checked before dereferencing. Failure to check for null can lead to segmentation
    faults. Additionally, if multiple threads are dequeuing tasks simultaneously,
    ensure proper synchronization mechanisms are in place to avoid unexpected behavior.
