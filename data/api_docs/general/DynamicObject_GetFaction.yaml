  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetFaction
  signature: int DynamicObject::GetFaction() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the faction ID associated with the dynamic object.
  description: The GetFaction method returns the faction identifier that determines
    the object's relationship with other units in the game world. This value is used
    by the TrinityCore engine to handle faction-based interactions such as hostility,
    friendship, and combat behavior. The returned faction ID corresponds to entries
    in the game's faction database and influences how the dynamic object interacts
    with players and NPCs based on their own faction settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the faction ID of the dynamic object. This value
    maps to a valid faction entry in the game's database, or 0 if no faction is assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;\nint factionId = dynObj->GetFaction();\nif\
      \ (factionId != 0)\n{\n    // Process faction-based logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Dynamic object has faction ID: %d\", factionId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Behavior Check
    code: "DynamicObject* dynObj = ...;\nPlayer* player = ...;\nif (dynObj->GetFaction()\
      \ != player->getFaction())\n{\n    // Object and player are in different factions\n\
      \    // May trigger hostile behavior or interaction\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with faction-based AI logic.
    The faction ID returned should be validated against the game's faction table to
    ensure it corresponds to a valid entry. Dynamic objects may not always have an
    assigned faction, in which case the method returns 0.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned faction ID for combat calculations
    without verifying its validity. Using invalid faction IDs can lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes in faction-based systems.
