  signature: void CharmInfo::LoadPetActionBar(const std::string & data)
documentation:
  brief: Loads and initializes the pet's action bar data from a serialized string.
  description: The LoadPetActionBar method is responsible for parsing and applying
    action bar data to a pet's charm information. This method takes a serialized string
    containing the pet's action bar layout and reconstructs the relevant internal
    state, typically used during pet loading or restoration processes. It ensures
    that the pet's action bar reflects the saved configuration, including spell and
    ability placements. The method is part of the CharmInfo class which manages the
    behavior and state of summoned creatures such as pets.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: A serialized string containing the pet's action bar data. This typically
      includes information about the spells, abilities, and their positions on the
      action bar that were previously saved.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Loading Pet Action Bar Data
    code: 'CharmInfo* charmInfo = player->GetCharmInfo();

      std::string actionBarData = "123 456 789 012 345"; // Example serialized data

      charmInfo->LoadPetActionBar(actionBarData);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during the pet's initialization or restoration
    phase when game state is being loaded. It assumes that the input string is properly
    formatted and contains valid action bar data. The method may internally validate
    or sanitize the data before applying it to the charm info.
  warnings: Incorrectly formatted data strings passed to this method could lead to
    undefined behavior or corruption of the pet's action bar state. Ensure that the
    serialized data matches the expected format before calling this method.
