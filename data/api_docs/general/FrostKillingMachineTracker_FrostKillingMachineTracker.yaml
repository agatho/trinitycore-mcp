  brief: Initializes a new instance of the FrostKillingMachineTracker class
  description: The FrostKillingMachineTracker constructor initializes a new instance
    of the FrostKillingMachineTracker class. This class is likely used to track and
    manage the state of frost-related killing machines or effects within the TrinityCore
    framework. The constructor sets up internal data structures and initializes member
    variables required for tracking frost-based combat mechanics. It ensures that
    the tracker is in a valid initial state before being used in gameplay scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of FrostKillingMachineTracker
    code: 'FrostKillingMachineTracker tracker;

      // Initializes a new FrostKillingMachineTracker instance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This appears to be a constructor method, so it should only be called during
    object creation. The implementation likely initializes internal tracking variables
    and prepares the object for use in combat systems.
