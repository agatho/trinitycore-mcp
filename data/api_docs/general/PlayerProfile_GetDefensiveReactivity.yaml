  class: PlayerProfile
  method: GetDefensiveReactivity
  signature: float PlayerProfile::GetDefensiveReactivity() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player's defensive reactivity value, which influences how aggressively
    the player responds to incoming attacks.
  description: The GetDefensiveReactivity method retrieves a floating-point value
    that represents the player's defensive reactivity. This value is used in combat
    calculations to determine how effectively a player can respond to incoming attacks,
    such as dodge chances or mitigation effectiveness. The defensive reactivity is
    typically influenced by factors like player class, equipped armor, talents, and
    buffs. It is a core component in calculating combat outcomes during player-versus-environment
    encounters. This method does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the player's defensive reactivity. The exact
    range depends on game mechanics but typically falls within a normalized scale
    where higher values indicate better defensive responsiveness.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'float reactivity = playerProfile->GetDefensiveReactivity();

      printf("Player''s defensive reactivity: %.2f\n", reactivity);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat Analysis
    code: "PlayerProfile* profile = player->GetPlayerProfile();\nfloat reactivity\
      \ = profile->GetDefensiveReactivity();\nif (reactivity > 1.0f)\n{\n    // Player\
      \ has enhanced defensive capabilities\n    printf(\"Enhanced defensive reactivity\
      \ detected\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the PlayerProfile class and should only be called
    on valid player profile instances. Defensive reactivity may vary based on active
    buffs, debuffs, or temporary stat modifiers applied during gameplay.
  warnings: Ensure that the PlayerProfile instance is valid before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior or crashes. The returned value might change dynamically
    during combat if buffs or debuffs are applied.
