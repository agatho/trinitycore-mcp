  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: RecordAchievement
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::RecordAchievement(uint32 achievementId)
documentation:
  brief: Records an achievement for the player associated with the behavior manager.
  description: The RecordAchievement method is used to grant or record a specific
    achievement for the player controlled by this behavior manager. This method typically
    interfaces with the game's achievement system to update the player's progress
    and unlock rewards. It is commonly used in custom AI behaviors, quest completions,
    or event triggers where an achievement should be awarded. The method does not
    validate if the achievement exists or if the player has already earned it; it
    simply records the achievement as if it were earned by the player.
  parameters:
  - name: achievementId
    description: The unique identifier of the achievement to record. This value must
      correspond to a valid achievement entry in the game's database. Achievement
      IDs are typically defined in the dbc files or through the achievement system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Awarding a Basic Achievement
    code: "void MyCustomAI::OnPlayerKilled() {\n    // Award the 'First Blood' achievement\n\
      \    m_behaviorManager->RecordAchievement(12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Achievement Recording
    code: "void MyCustomAI::OnEventTriggered() {\n    if (player->GetLevel() >= 80)\
      \ {\n        m_behaviorManager->RecordAchievement(67890); // 'Level 80 Hero'\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the behavior manager is associated with a valid
    player object. If called without an active player context, it may silently fail
    or produce undefined behavior. The achievement must already be defined in the
    game's database for this to have any effect.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid achievement ID may cause issues in
    the achievement system or lead to unexpected behavior. Always verify that the
    achievement ID exists before calling this method. Also, ensure that the player
    context is valid to avoid potential crashes or data corruption.
