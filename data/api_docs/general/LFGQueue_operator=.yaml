  brief: Moves the contents of another LFGQueue instance to this instance
  description: The move assignment operator transfers all resources and state from
    the right-hand side LFGQueue object to the current object. This operation is typically
    used in scenarios where an LFGQueue object needs to be reassigned to another LFGQueue
    object, such as when returning from a function or assigning temporary objects.
    The moved-from object will be left in a valid but unspecified state, and should
    not be used after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's LFG system,
    this operator is essential for efficient resource management during queue operations
    and player group matching.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current LFGQueue object after the move assignment has
    been completed
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment Usage
    code: 'LFGQueue queue1;

      LFGQueue queue2 = std::move(queue1); // Move-assigns queue1 to queue2

      // queue1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Function Return with Move Assignment
    code: "LFGQueue createQueue() {\n    LFGQueue queue;\n    // ... populate queue\
      \ ...\n    return queue; // Move semantics used for efficient return\n}\n\n\
      LFGQueue mainQueue = createQueue(); // Move assignment in action"
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator leverages C++11 move semantics to efficiently transfer ownership
    of resources without deep copying. The implementation should ensure that the moved-from
    object is left in a valid state, typically by resetting internal pointers or clearing
    containers. In TrinityCore's LFG system, this is particularly important for performance
    when handling frequent queue updates and player group formations.
  warnings: After move assignment, the right-hand side object must not be used, as
    its resources have been transferred. Attempting to access members of the moved-from
    object may result in undefined behavior or crashes. This operator should only
    be used with rvalue expressions (temporary objects) for optimal performance.
