documentation:
  brief: Destroys an instance of the IBotSpawnerCallback interface, releasing all
    associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the IBotSpawnerCallback interface is responsible
    for cleaning up any resources allocated during the lifetime of a bot spawner callback
    object. This method ensures proper memory management and prevents resource leaks
    when instances of classes implementing this interface are destroyed. In the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system, this callback interface likely handles events related
    to bot spawning operations, such as notifying when bots are created or destroyed.
    The destructor should be called automatically by the C++ runtime when the object
    goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted, and it typically performs cleanup
    tasks like releasing memory, closing handles, or unregistering from event systems.

  - title: Basic Destructor Usage
    code: 'IBotSpawnerCallback* callback = new MyBotSpawnerCallback();

      // ... use the callback ...

      delete callback; // Triggers ~IBotSpawnerCallback()'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a virtual destructor, which means it's designed to be overridden
    in derived classes. When implementing this interface, ensure that any derived
    destructors properly call the base class destructor to maintain correct object
    destruction order.
