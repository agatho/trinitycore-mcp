  brief: Processes incoming emote chat messages from players in the World of Warcraft
    client
  description: The HandleChatMessageEmoteOpcode method is responsible for handling
    emote chat messages sent by players through the WorldSession. This method processes
    the emote data received from the client, validates it against game rules and permissions,
    and broadcasts the emote to appropriate recipients within the player's vicinity
    or specified target. The method ensures that emotes are properly formatted and
    comply with server restrictions such as cooldowns, permissions, and channel limitations.
    It integrates with the broader chat system to maintain consistency in how emotes
    are displayed across the game world.

  - title: Basic Emote Handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleChatMessageEmoteOpcode(WorldPackets::Chat::ChatMessageEmote&\
      \ chatMessageEmote)\n{\n    // Validate emote type and player permissions\n\
      \    if (!CanSendEmote(chatMessageEmote.emoteId))\n        return;\n    \n \
      \   // Broadcast the emote to nearby players\n    SendEmoteToNearbyPlayers(chatMessageEmote);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core chat handling system and is invoked automatically
    when a client sends an emote packet. It relies on the player's current state,
    including location, permissions, and cooldown timers. The method does not directly
    modify the database but may trigger other systems such as achievement tracking
    or reputation updates based on the emote content.
  warnings: Improper handling of emote packets can lead to exploits such as spamming
    invalid emotes or bypassing cooldown restrictions. Developers should ensure proper
    validation and sanitization of emote data before broadcasting to prevent abuse.
    Also, be cautious about performance impact when broadcasting emotes in densely
    populated areas.
