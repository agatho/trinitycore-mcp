documentation:
  brief: Returns the movement speed rate for a specified move type
  description: The GetSpeedRate method retrieves the speed multiplier for a given
    UnitMoveType, which determines how fast a unit moves relative to its base speed.
    This method is commonly used in World of Warcraft client-server interactions to
    calculate movement speeds for different movement types such as walk, run, swim,
    and fly. The returned value represents a multiplier that can be applied to base
    movement speeds to determine actual movement rates.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the speed rate multiplier for the specified
    move type. A value of 1.0 indicates normal speed, while values greater than 1.0
    indicate faster movement and less than 1.0 indicate slower movement.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'float speed = unit->GetSpeedRate(UnitMoveType::RUN);

      // This returns the run speed rate multiplier'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with movement calculations and
    may be affected by buffs, debuffs, or other game mechanics that modify movement
    speed. The method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context.
  warnings: Be aware that the returned value may vary based on the unit's current
    state (such as being in combat or having movement modifiers). Also note that different
    move types may have different base speeds, so this method should be used carefully
    when comparing different movement types.
