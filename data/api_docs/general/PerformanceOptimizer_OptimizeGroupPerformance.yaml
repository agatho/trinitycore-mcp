  class: PerformanceOptimizer
  method: OptimizeGroupPerformance
  signature: void PerformanceOptimizer::OptimizeGroupPerformance(const int & botGuids)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes performance for a group of bots by adjusting their behavior and
    resource allocation.
  description: The OptimizeGroupPerformance method is designed to enhance the efficiency
    of a group of AI-controlled bots within the TrinityCore framework. It analyzes
    the current state of the bot group, including their roles, tasks, and resource
    usage, and applies optimizations to improve overall performance. This may involve
    redistributing responsibilities among bots, adjusting behavior parameters, or
    modifying resource allocation strategies. The method is typically invoked when
    a significant change occurs in the group's composition or environment that could
    affect performance. It operates on a collection of bot GUIDs provided as input,
    ensuring that all members of the specified group are considered during optimization.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuids
    description: A reference to an integer representing the unique identifiers (GUIDs)
      of the bots in the group. These GUIDs are used to identify and optimize specific
      bots within the performance group.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceOptimizer optimizer;

      int botGroupGuids[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      optimizer.OptimizeGroupPerformance(botGroupGuids);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided GUIDs correspond to valid bot entities
    within the TrinityCore environment. The optimization process may involve temporary
    resource locking or state changes that could affect real-time performance if called
    during active gameplay. It is recommended to call this method during idle periods
    or when the group is not actively engaged in critical tasks.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid or non-existent bot GUIDs can result
    in undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure all GUIDs are validated before passing
    them to the method. Additionally, frequent calls to this method may cause performance
    degradation due to overhead from optimization calculations.
