  signature: void Player::RemoveQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(uint16 slot, int8 objectiveIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a quest objective flag from a specific slot in the player's quest
    log.
  description: This method removes a specified quest objective flag from the given
    quest slot. It is used to clear flags that indicate progress toward completing
    a quest objective. The method operates on the player's quest log, specifically
    targeting a particular slot and objective index within that slot. This functionality
    is typically used when a quest objective is completed or when a player needs to
    reset certain quest progress flags.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The quest slot number where the objective flag should be removed.
      This represents the position in the player's quest log, typically ranging from
      0-63.
  - name: objectiveIndex
    description: The index of the specific objective within the slot to remove the
      flag from. This is usually a negative value indicating the objective position
      within the slot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->RemoveQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(0, 0);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: '// Remove a specific objective flag from a quest slot

      uint16 slot = 5;

      int8 objectiveIndex = -1;

      player->RemoveQuestSlotObjectiveFlag(slot, objectiveIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal quest tracking system and should be used
    carefully when modifying quest progress flags. It does not directly interact with
    the game world or player's actual quest objectives but rather manages the flag
    state within the player's quest log.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect quest progression tracking,
    potentially causing quests to appear incomplete or preventing proper completion.
    This method should only be called when a quest objective has been fully completed
    or when resetting flags is required.
