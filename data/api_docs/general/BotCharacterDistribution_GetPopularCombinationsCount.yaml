  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: GetPopularCombinationsCount
  signature: uint32 BotCharacterDistribution::GetPopularCombinationsCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of popular character combinations stored in the distribution.
  description: The GetPopularCombinationsCount method retrieves the total number of
    character combinations that have been identified as popular within the bot character
    distribution system. This count typically reflects how many unique class-race
    combinations or other character configurations are considered statistically significant
    or frequently used by bots in the game environment. The method is commonly used
    to determine the size of internal data structures that store these popular combinations,
    which may be utilized for generating realistic bot characters or analyzing player
    behavior patterns. This value is usually populated during initialization or when
    the distribution data is updated based on observed gameplay trends.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of popular character combinations
    currently stored in the BotCharacterDistribution instance. Returns zero if no
    combinations have been identified or loaded yet.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution distribution;

      uint32 count = distribution.GetPopularCombinationsCount();

      printf("There are %u popular combinations in the distribution.\n", count);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Conditional Logic
    code: "BotCharacterDistribution distribution;\nuint32 popularCount = distribution.GetPopularCombinationsCount();\n\
      if (popularCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Distribution contains %u popular combinations.\\\
      n\", popularCount);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No popular combinations found in\
      \ the distribution.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically a read-only accessor that does not modify internal
    state. It may involve iterating through internal data structures to count valid
    entries, so performance could be impacted if the distribution contains a large
    number of combinations. The returned value should be considered immutable until
    the next update to the distribution.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotCharacterDistribution instance has been properly initialized
    before calling this method, as it may return unexpected values if internal data
    structures are not correctly populated. This method does not validate the integrity
    of the stored combinations, so calling code should ensure the distribution is
    in a consistent state.
