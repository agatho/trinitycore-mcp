documentation:
  brief: Casts the Mage Armor spell on the current target.
  description: The CastMageArmor method is responsible for casting the Mage Armor
    spell, which provides a significant increase to the mage's armor value. This method
    typically operates within the context of an AI behavior system where it determines
    when and how to apply the armor buff. The spell enhances the mage's defensive
    capabilities by increasing their physical armor, making them more resilient against
    melee attacks. It is generally used in combat situations where the mage needs
    to survive longer or when the AI decides that armor is beneficial for the current
    tactical scenario.

  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI Context
    code: "void MageAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->GetVictim())\n    {\n\
      \        // Cast Mage Armor when health is low\n        if (me->GetHealthPct()\
      \ < 30.0f)\n        {\n            CastMageArmor();\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks for existing Mage Armor buffs before casting to
    avoid redundant spell casts. The AI system may also consider factors such as mana
    availability, combat state, and target threat level before executing this action.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI context has a valid target before calling this method,
    as casting without a proper target might result in unexpected behavior or failure
    to cast the spell.
