  class: LfgPlayerData
  method: GetTicket
  signature: const int & LfgPlayerData::GetTicket() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the LFG ticket identifier associated with the player.
  description: The GetTicket method returns a constant reference to an integer representing
    the player's current Looking for Group (LFG) ticket. This ticket is used by the
    TrinityCore server to track and manage group matching requests for dungeons, raids,
    and other player activities. The returned value uniquely identifies the player's
    LFG request within the system. This method does not modify any internal state
    and can be called safely during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an integer that represents the unique LFG ticket
    identifier assigned to the player. A value of -1 typically indicates no active
    ticket, while positive integers represent valid ticket IDs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "LfgPlayerData* playerData = ...;\nint ticketId = playerData->GetTicket();\n\
      if (ticketId != -1)\n{\n    // Player has an active LFG ticket\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Active ticket ID: \" << ticketId << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking for Active LFG Request
    code: "LfgPlayerData* playerData = ...;\nconst int& ticket = playerData->GetTicket();\n\
      if (ticket > 0)\n{\n    // Player is queued for a group\n    // Use ticket ID\
      \ to query group status or cancel request\n}\nelse if (ticket == -1)\n{\n  \
      \  // No active LFG request\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns a reference to an internal member variable, so the returned
    value should not be modified directly. The ticket ID is managed by the LFG system
    and may change when a player joins or leaves a group. This method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from immutable data.
  warnings: Do not modify the returned reference as it points to an internal member
    variable. Be aware that the ticket ID can be reset to -1 when a player leaves
    a group or cancels their LFG request, so always validate the return value before
    using it in operations that require a valid ticket.
