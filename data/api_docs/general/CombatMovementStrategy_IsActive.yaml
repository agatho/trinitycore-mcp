  class: CombatMovementStrategy
  method: IsActive
  signature: bool CombatMovementStrategy::IsActive(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the combat movement strategy is currently active for the
    specified bot AI.
  description: The IsActive method checks if the CombatMovementStrategy is currently
    enabled and applicable for the given BotAI instance. This strategy typically controls
    how bots move during combat situations, such as maintaining distance from enemies
    or closing to melee range. The method evaluates internal state flags and conditions
    to determine if movement behavior should be active. It's commonly used by the
    AI system to decide whether to apply movement logic during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the combat movement strategy is currently active and ready
    to influence bot movement behavior; returns false otherwise. The method may return
    false if the strategy has been disabled, the bot is not in combat, or other preconditions
    are not met.
  examples:
  - title: Check if combat movement strategy is active
    code: "if (strategy->IsActive(ai)) {\n    // Apply combat movement logic\n   \
      \ ai->SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_COMBAT);\n} else {\n    // Fall back to\
      \ default movement\n    ai->SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_DEFAULT);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during AI update cycles. The implementation
    likely checks internal flags and state variables rather than performing expensive
    operations. It's important to note that IsActive may return false even when a
    bot is in combat if the strategy has been temporarily disabled or if specific
    conditions are not met.
