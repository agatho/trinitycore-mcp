documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the ActionFactory class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the ActionFactory
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the factory exists throughout the application
    lifecycle. This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's AI and action handling
    systems to retrieve the global action factory responsible for creating and managing
    various game actions. The returned pointer should be used directly without attempting
    to delete or manage its lifetime, as it represents a globally managed singleton
    object.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single globally shared instance of the ActionFactory class.
    The method never returns NULL in normal operation, as the singleton is typically
    initialized during system startup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ActionFactory* factory = ActionFactory::instance();\n// Use the factory\
      \ to create actions\nif (factory)\n{\n    // Perform action creation or management\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "class CustomAI : public CreatureAI\n{\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32\
      \ diff) override\n    {\n        ActionFactory* factory = ActionFactory::instance();\n\
      \        if (factory)\n        {\n            // Create and execute actions\
      \ using the singleton factory\n            // Example: factory->CreateAction(...);\n\
      \        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe in TrinityCore's implementation as it typically
    uses a static local variable or similar thread-safe initialization technique.
    The singleton instance is created on first access and persists for the entire
    application lifetime, making it suitable for global state management.
  warnings: Do not attempt to manually delete or destroy the returned pointer, as
    it is managed by the singleton pattern. Using this method in multithreaded contexts
    should be safe, but ensure that any actions created through this factory are properly
    synchronized if they modify shared game state.
