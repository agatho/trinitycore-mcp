  method: operator()
  signature: void RespawnDo::operator()(const int * param0) const
documentation:
  brief: Respawns all game objects and creatures in the specified area.
  description: The RespawnDo::operator() method is a functor used to trigger the respawning
    of all game objects and creatures within a defined zone or area. This method is
    typically invoked during world updates or specific event triggers to restore entities
    that have been despawned due to time limits, player actions, or system resets.
    It operates on a provided integer parameter that usually represents a zone ID
    or instance identifier. The method ensures all relevant entities are properly
    respawned according to their spawn rules and reset timers.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: An integer parameter representing the zone or instance identifier
      for which objects and creatures should be respawned. This value typically corresponds
      to a valid map ID or instance context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Respawn all entities in a specific zone
    code: 'RespawnDo respawner;

      int zoneId = 1234;

      respawner(&zoneId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using RespawnDo with instance context
    code: 'RespawnDo respawner;

      int instanceId = 5678;

      respawner(&instanceId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's world update loop and event
    handling systems. It may be called from multiple threads, so thread safety considerations
    should be taken into account when implementing custom logic. Performance can vary
    depending on the number of entities in the specified area.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid zone ID or instance identifier may
    result in undefined behavior or no respawning occurring. Ensure that the parameter
    value corresponds to a valid map or instance before invoking this method.
