  class: DB2Manager
  method: GetAreasForGroup
  signature: int DB2Manager::GetAreasForGroup(uint32 areaGroupId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the number of areas associated with a specified area group ID.
  description: The GetAreasForGroup method returns the count of areas that belong
    to a given area group in the TrinityCore database. This functionality is primarily
    used for managing and querying hierarchical area data structures within the game
    world. The method accesses internal DB2 data structures to determine how many
    areas are linked to the specified group ID, which can be useful for various game
    systems such as zone-based quest tracking, area-based event management, or UI
    display logic that requires knowing the size of an area group. It is important
    to note that this method does not return the actual area IDs themselves, but rather
    the count of areas in the group.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of areas associated with the specified
    area group ID. Returns 0 if no areas are found for the given group ID or if the
    group ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int areaCount = sDB2Manager->GetAreasForGroup(1234);\nif (areaCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Area group 1234 contains %d areas\\n\", areaCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on pre-loaded DB2 data structures and assumes that the
    DB2Manager has been properly initialized with area group information. The returned
    count may be zero if no areas are assigned to the specified group or if the group
    ID does not exist in the database.
