documentation:
  brief: Returns the corpse type enumeration indicating the kind of corpse this object
    represents.
  description: The GetType method retrieves the CorpseType enumeration value that
    identifies the specific category or type of corpse this Corpse object represents.
    In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, corpses can be classified into different types
    such as normal player corpses, bones, and other specialized corpse variants. This
    method is commonly used during corpse processing, loot distribution, and gameplay
    logic to determine how a corpse should behave or be handled by the game system.
    The returned value directly corresponds to predefined constants in the CorpseType
    enum which are used throughout the server's core systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A CorpseType enumeration value indicating the specific type of corpse.
    Possible values include normal corpses, bones, and other specialized types depending
    on the game state and player actions. The method will always return a valid CorpseType
    value as long as the object is properly initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Checking corpse type for loot handling
    code: "Corpse* corpse = player->GetCorpse();\nif (corpse && corpse->GetType()\
      \ == CORPSE_BONES)\n{\n    // Handle bones differently from regular corpses\n\
      \    // Bones typically cannot be looted by players\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Determining corpse behavior based on type
    code: "Corpse* corpse = GetPlayerCorpse();\nswitch (corpse->GetType())\n{\n  \
      \  case CORPSE_NORMAL:\n        // Normal player corpse - can be looted\n  \
      \      break;\n    case CORPSE_BONES:\n        // Bones - cannot be looted,\
      \ only despawned\n        break;\n    default:\n        // Handle other types\
      \ or unknown cases\n        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a constant getter and does not modify the corpse object. It's
    typically called during gameplay events such as player death, corpse despawn,
    or loot processing. The CorpseType enumeration values are defined in the core
    server code and should not be modified without understanding their impact on game
    mechanics.
  warnings: Ensure that the Corpse object is valid before calling this method, as
    calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The returned CorpseType
    value should be checked against expected values in your logic to prevent unexpected
    behavior during corpse handling.
