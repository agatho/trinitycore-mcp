  class: SummonPropertiesEntry
  method: GetFlags
  signature: int SummonPropertiesEntry::GetFlags() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flag bits associated with summon properties for determining
    summon behavior and restrictions.
  description: The GetFlags method returns an integer value representing the bitmask
    of flags defined for a specific summon properties entry. These flags control various
    aspects of how summons behave, such as their duration, faction, control type,
    and other summon-specific attributes within the World of Warcraft game mechanics.
    The returned value is typically used by the core engine to determine valid summon
    operations and enforce restrictions based on the summon's properties. This method
    does not require any parameters and always returns a consistent integer value
    for the given summon properties entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the bitmask of flags associated with this summon
    properties entry. Each bit in the integer corresponds to a specific summon behavior
    or restriction, such as whether the summon can be dismissed, if it's a pet or
    minion, its faction relationship, and other summon-specific attributes.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Summon Flags
    code: "SummonPropertiesEntry* entry = sObjectMgr->GetSummonProperties(12345);\n\
      if (entry)\n{\n    int flags = entry->GetFlags();\n    if (flags & SUMMON_FLAG_PET)\n\
      \        printf(\"This summon is a pet\\n\");\n    if (flags & SUMMON_FLAG_CONTROL)\n\
      \        printf(\"This summon can be controlled by the player\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are typically defined in constants such
    as SUMMON_FLAG_PET, SUMMON_FLAG_CONTROL, etc., which are used throughout the TrinityCore
    codebase to determine summon behavior. The integer value is a bitmask, so multiple
    flags can be checked using bitwise AND operations.
