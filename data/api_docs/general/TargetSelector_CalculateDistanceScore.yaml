  class: TargetSelector
  method: CalculateDistanceScore
  signature: float TargetSelector::CalculateDistanceScore(Unit * target, const SelectionContext
    & context)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates a distance-based score for a target unit within the selection
    context.
  description: The CalculateDistanceScore method evaluates and returns a float value
    representing how desirable a given target unit is based on its distance from the
    selector's current position. This score is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes to prioritize targets that are closer or farther away depending on the
    specific behavior logic. The method considers the selection context which may
    include factors like range limits, threat levels, or targeting preferences. It
    is commonly invoked during target selection phases where units must choose between
    multiple viable candidates based on proximity metrics.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the potential target for
      which the distance score will be calculated.
  - name: context
    description: Reference to a SelectionContext object containing contextual data
      such as range constraints, threat levels, or other selection parameters that
      influence how distance affects scoring.
  returns: A float value indicating the calculated distance score for the target.
    Higher values generally represent more desirable targets based on proximity, though
    exact interpretation depends on the implementation logic and context.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Target Selection
    code: "float score = selector.CalculateDistanceScore(targetUnit, selectionContext);\n\
      if (score > bestScore) {\n    bestScore = score;\n    bestTarget = targetUnit;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Distance Score for AI Behavior
    code: "float distanceScore = targetSelector.CalculateDistanceScore(enemy, context);\n\
      if (distanceScore > 0.5f) {\n    // Prefer closer enemies\n    DoAttack(enemy);\n\
      } else {\n    // Consider other factors if enemy is too far\n    SelectAlternativeTarget();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both the target unit and context are valid objects.
    The returned score may vary depending on whether the target is within acceptable
    range limits defined in the context. Performance-wise, this method should be lightweight
    since it primarily involves distance calculations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before calling this method,
    as dereferencing a null pointer will cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that the scoring logic might change based on different AI behaviors or game modes.
