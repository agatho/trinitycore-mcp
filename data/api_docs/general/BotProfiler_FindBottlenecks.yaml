  class: BotProfiler
  method: FindBottlenecks
  signature: int BotProfiler::FindBottlenecks(HotspotCategory category, uint64_t sessionId)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and identifies performance bottlenecks in bot behavior for a specified
    hotspot category and session.
  description: The FindBottlenecks method is designed to evaluate and locate performance
    issues within the bot system, specifically focusing on areas where bot operations
    may be inefficient or causing delays. It takes a HotspotCategory parameter to
    determine which type of bottlenecks to analyze and uses a sessionId to scope the
    analysis to a specific session context. This method likely processes profiling
    data collected during bot execution and returns an integer indicating the number
    of identified bottlenecks or an error code if the operation fails. The method
    is part of the BotProfiler class, which is responsible for monitoring and optimizing
    bot performance in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: category
    description: Specifies the HotspotCategory to analyze for bottlenecks. This determines
      which type of performance issues to focus on, such as AI decision-making, movement
      patterns, or resource usage.
  - name: sessionId
    description: A unique identifier for the session being analyzed. This allows the
      method to scope its bottleneck detection to a specific bot session, enabling
      targeted profiling and optimization.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of bottlenecks found during
    analysis. A value of 0 indicates no bottlenecks were detected, while a positive
    integer indicates the count of performance issues identified. Negative values
    may indicate errors or invalid parameters.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int bottleneckCount = botProfiler.FindBottlenecks(HotspotCategory::AI,\
      \ 123456789ULL);\nif (bottleneckCount > 0) {\n    // Process identified bottlenecks\n\
      \    printf(\"Found %d bottlenecks in AI category\\n\", bottleneckCount);\n\
      } else if (bottleneckCount == 0) {\n    // No bottlenecks detected\n    printf(\"\
      No bottlenecks found in AI category\\n\");\n} else {\n    // Error occurred\
      \ during analysis\n    printf(\"Error analyzing bottlenecks: %d\\n\", bottleneckCount);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other profiling tools to provide
    comprehensive performance analysis. It may require prior data collection or profiling
    sessions to be effective. The HotspotCategory enum should be defined elsewhere
    in the codebase, and the sessionId must correspond to an active bot session for
    meaningful results.
  warnings: Ensure that the HotspotCategory parameter is valid before calling this
    method, as invalid categories may result in undefined behavior or no analysis
    being performed. Session IDs must be valid and correspond to existing sessions;
    otherwise, the method may return error codes or fail silently.
