  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: LoadBattlegroundStrategies
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::LoadBattlegroundStrategies()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads all battleground strategy configurations for AI behavior
    management.
  description: The LoadBattlegroundStrategies method is responsible for loading and
    initializing all predefined battleground strategies within the AdvancedBehaviorManager.
    This method ensures that AI-controlled entities are equipped with appropriate
    tactical behaviors specific to various battleground scenarios. It typically reads
    configuration data from internal databases or configuration files, sets up strategy
    mappings, and prepares the behavior system for dynamic strategy selection during
    battleground events. The method is usually invoked during server initialization
    or when a new battleground instance is created to ensure that all AI participants
    have access to their respective strategic behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Server Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBattlegroundAI()\n{\n    AdvancedBehaviorManager* behaviorMgr\
      \ = sAdvancedBehaviorManager;\n    behaviorMgr->LoadBattlegroundStrategies();\n\
      \    // AI strategies are now loaded and ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during initialization to avoid duplicate
    strategy loading. The method may perform database queries or file I/O operations,
    so calling it excessively can impact performance. It's recommended to call this
    method before any battleground instances are created.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup may result in
    memory leaks or duplicate strategy registrations. Ensure that the method is not
    called concurrently from multiple threads as it might lead to race conditions
    in strategy loading.
