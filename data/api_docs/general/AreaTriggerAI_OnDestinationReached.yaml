documentation:
  brief: Called when an area trigger reaches its destination
  description: The OnDestinationReached method is a virtual callback function in the
    AreaTriggerAI class that is invoked when an area trigger has successfully moved
    to and reached its designated destination. This method serves as a hook for custom
    AI behavior when the area trigger completes its movement path. It is typically
    used to execute specific actions, such as spawning creatures, activating events,
    or triggering other game mechanics upon arrival. The method is called by the core
    AI system after the area trigger has finished moving and has arrived at its target
    location.

    code: "class MyAreaTriggerAI : public AreaTriggerAI\n{\npublic:\n    MyAreaTriggerAI(Creature*\
      \ creature) : AreaTriggerAI(creature) {}\n\n    void OnDestinationReached()\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Spawn a creature when the area trigger reaches\
      \ its destination\n        GetCreature()->SummonCreature(12345, GetCreature()->GetPositionX(),\
      \ GetCreature()->GetPositionY(), GetCreature()->GetPositionZ(), 0, TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN,\
      \ 30000);\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the area trigger AI system and is only called when
    the area trigger has completed its movement path. It should not be used to perform
    heavy operations as it may impact performance. The method is called from the game's
    main update loop, so any long-running tasks should be handled asynchronously.
  warnings: Do not call methods that modify the area trigger's state or movement directly
    within this function unless you are certain about the implications. This method
    is meant for triggering events rather than controlling movement itself. Avoid
    performing operations that could cause the area trigger to be destroyed or removed
    during execution.
