  class: IBotSessionManager
  method: GetActiveSessions
  signature: int IBotSessionManager::GetActiveSessions() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of currently active bot sessions managed by the session
    manager.
  description: The GetActiveSessions method returns an integer representing the total
    number of active bot sessions currently being managed by the IBotSessionManager
    instance. This count includes all sessions that are in an active state, meaning
    they are either running, paused, or otherwise engaged in bot operations. The method
    provides a quick way to monitor the current load or resource usage of bot sessions
    within the system. It is typically used for debugging, monitoring, or administrative
    purposes to understand how many bots are currently operational.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the number of active bot sessions. A return
    value of zero indicates no active sessions, while positive values indicate the
    count of active sessions.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Active Sessions
    code: "int activeCount = sessionManager->GetActiveSessions();\nif (activeCount\
      \ > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"There are \" << activeCount << \" active bot sessions.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No active bot sessions found.\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically a read-only operation and should not modify any
    internal state. The returned count may change between calls if bot sessions are
    started or stopped concurrently. It's recommended to use this method in a thread-safe
    context when dealing with concurrent access.
