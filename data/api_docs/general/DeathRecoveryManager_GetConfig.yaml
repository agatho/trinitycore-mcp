  class: DeathRecoveryManager
  method: GetConfig
  signature: const DeathRecoveryConfig & DeathRecoveryManager::GetConfig() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration settings for the death recovery system.
  description: The GetConfig method returns a constant reference to the DeathRecoveryConfig
    object that holds all configuration parameters for the death recovery system.
    This configuration includes settings such as recovery chances, item loss rates,
    experience penalties, and other mechanics related to character death and resurrection
    within the TrinityCore framework. The returned reference is immutable, ensuring
    that external code cannot modify the configuration directly through this accessor.
    This method is typically called during initialization or when processing death-related
    events to determine how a player should be handled upon death.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to the DeathRecoveryConfig object containing all current
    configuration settings for the death recovery system. The reference remains valid
    for the lifetime of the DeathRecoveryManager instance and should not be stored
    or used beyond that scope.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Death Recovery Configuration
    code: 'const DeathRecoveryConfig& config = deathRecoveryManager.GetConfig();

      uint32 recoveryChance = config.RecoveryChance;

      bool allowCorpseRecovery = config.AllowCorpseRecovery;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Configuration in Death Handling Logic
    code: "void OnPlayerDeath(Player* player) {\n    const DeathRecoveryConfig& config\
      \ = sDeathRecoveryManager->GetConfig();\n    if (config.RecoveryChance > urand(0,\
      \ 100)) {\n        // Attempt death recovery based on configured chance\n  \
      \      player->HandleDeathRecovery();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it only returns a constant reference to an
    immutable configuration object. The DeathRecoveryConfig should be initialized
    during server startup and not modified at runtime through this interface. The
    returned reference is valid only while the DeathRecoveryManager instance exists.
  warnings: Do not attempt to modify the configuration through the returned reference,
    as it is const. Modifications should be made through dedicated setter methods
    or configuration files. Be aware that accessing this method during server shutdown
    may result in undefined behavior if the manager has already been destroyed.
