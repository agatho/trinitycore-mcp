  signature: uint32 Quest::GetCompleteEmote() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the emote ID that is played when a quest is completed.
  description: The GetCompleteEmote method retrieves the emote ID associated with
    a quest's completion. This emote is typically used to display visual effects or
    animations when players finish a quest, providing feedback on the quest's completion
    status. The method returns an integer value representing the emote ID, which can
    be used for various game mechanics including quest completion animations and player
    feedback. The emote ID is usually defined in the quest's database entry and may
    vary based on the specific quest being completed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the emote ID that should be played when the
    quest is completed. This value corresponds to an emote defined in the game's database,
    typically used for visual feedback during quest completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint32 emoteId = quest->GetCompleteEmote();\nif (emoteId > 0)\n{\n    //\
      \ Play the emote\n    player->PlayEmote(emoteId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is part of the Quest class and returns a value that should be
    used in conjunction with other quest-related methods. The emote ID returned by
    this method may vary based on the quest's configuration and could potentially
    be zero if no emote is defined for the specific quest.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context; it's
    typically used within quest completion handling code. Be aware that some quests
    may not have a complete emote defined, which could result in a return value of
    zero.
