documentation:
  brief: Validates the integrity and readiness of a bot session before allowing further
    operations.
  description: The ValidateSession method checks whether a given bot session is in
    a valid state for processing. It ensures that all required components of the session
    are properly initialized and that the session meets the criteria necessary for
    safe execution within the TrinityCore framework. This validation typically includes
    checking for null pointers, verifying session state consistency, and confirming
    that underlying resources such as connection handles or data structures are correctly
    set up. The method is commonly used during session activation or before executing
    commands to prevent runtime errors due to malformed or uninitialized sessions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the session passes all validation checks and is ready for
    use; otherwise, returns false if any validation fails, indicating that the session
    should not be processed further.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Validation
    code: "std::shared_ptr<IBotSession> session = botSessionFactory->CreateSession();\n\
      if (botSessionFactory->ValidateSession(session)) {\n    // Proceed with session\
      \ operations\n    session->ExecuteCommand(\"move forward\");\n} else {\n   \
      \ // Handle invalid session\n    LOG_ERROR(\"bot\", \"Session validation failed\
      \ for session ID: {}\", session->GetId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may perform lightweight checks only and does not guarantee full
    operational readiness. It is recommended to call this method before any substantial
    interaction with the session object, especially in multi-threaded environments
    where session state might change concurrently.
  warnings: Calling ValidateSession on a session that has already been closed or destroyed
    can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure that the session object remains
    valid and accessible when invoking this method.
