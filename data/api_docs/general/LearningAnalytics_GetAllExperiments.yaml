documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of all experiment results stored within the learning analytics
    system
  description: The GetAllExperiments method returns a vector containing all experiment
    results currently available in the LearningAnalytics system. This method provides
    access to the complete dataset of experiments that have been recorded, allowing
    developers to analyze or process all stored experimental data. The returned vector
    contains objects of type ExperimentResult which represent individual experiment
    records with their associated metrics and metadata. This method is typically used
    for reporting, data analysis, or generating comprehensive experiment summaries
    across the entire system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<ExperimentResult> containing all experiment results currently
    stored in the LearningAnalytics system. Each ExperimentResult object represents
    a complete experiment record with its associated data and metrics.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve All Experiments
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<ExperimentResult> experiments\
      \ = analytics.GetAllExperiments();\nfor (const auto& experiment : experiments)\
      \ {\n    // Process each experiment result\n    std::cout << \"Experiment ID:\
      \ \" << experiment.GetId() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Processing All Experiments for Analysis
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<ExperimentResult> allExperiments\
      \ = analytics.GetAllExperiments();\nint totalExperiments = allExperiments.size();\n\
      float averageSuccessRate = 0.0f;\nfor (const auto& experiment : allExperiments)\
      \ {\n    averageSuccessRate += experiment.GetSuccessRate();\n}\nif (totalExperiments\
      \ > 0) {\n    averageSuccessRate /= totalExperiments;\n    std::cout << \"Average\
      \ success rate: \" << averageSuccessRate << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a complete retrieval of all stored experiment data,
    which may have performance implications if the dataset is large. The returned
    vector is a copy of the internal data structure, so modifications to the returned
    vector will not affect the original data. This method should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method with large datasets as it may cause
    memory pressure or performance degradation. The returned vector contains copies
    of experiment data, so modifying elements within the vector will not affect the
    original stored experiments. Consider caching results if this method is called
    frequently.
