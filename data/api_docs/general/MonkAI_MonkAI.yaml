  class: MonkAI
  method: MonkAI
  signature: void MonkAI::MonkAI(int * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the Monk AI behavior for a bot character with specified parameters.
  description: The MonkAI constructor initializes the artificial intelligence system
    for a monk class bot in TrinityCore. This method sets up the core behavior patterns,
    ability usage logic, and combat strategies specific to the monk class. It configures
    the bot's decision-making process based on its current health, mana levels, and
    target status. The initialization includes setting up spell priorities, cooldown
    tracking, and movement behaviors that align with standard monk gameplay mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's unique identifier or
      index within the AI system. This parameter is used to associate the AI behavior
      with a specific bot instance in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Monk AI Initialization
    code: 'int botId = 12345;

      MonkAI* ai = new MonkAI(&botId);

      // The AI is now initialized and ready to control the monk bot'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing Multiple Monk Bots
    code: "int botIds[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n   \
      \ MonkAI* ai = new MonkAI(&botIds[i]);\n    // Each bot AI is initialized with\
      \ its respective ID\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per bot instance during initialization.
    The bot parameter must point to a valid integer identifier that corresponds to
    an existing bot in the TrinityCore system. Memory management for the bot pointer
    is the responsibility of the caller.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer or invalid bot identifier may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the bot identifier is unique and properly registered
    within the AI subsystem before calling this constructor.
