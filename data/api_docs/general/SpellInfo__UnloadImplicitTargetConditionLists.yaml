documentation:
  brief: Clears all implicit target condition lists associated with the spell.
  description: The _UnloadImplicitTargetConditionLists method is responsible for releasing
    memory and clearing any cached condition lists that are associated with implicit
    target conditions for a spell. This method is typically invoked during spell data
    cleanup or reloading processes to ensure that no stale or dangling references
    remain in memory. It helps maintain the integrity of spell targeting logic by
    ensuring that condition checks are performed against fresh data. The method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations, acting purely as a
    cleanup utility.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Spell Data Cleanup
    code: "void MySpellHandler::OnSpellUnload()\n{\n    spellInfo->_UnloadImplicitTargetConditionLists();\n\
      \    // Other cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is an internal utility and should not be called directly by external
    code. It's usually invoked automatically during spell data reloading or destruction
    phases. The method assumes that all related condition lists have been properly
    initialized before being loaded.
  warnings: Calling this method manually may lead to undefined behavior if the spell
    data is still in use elsewhere. It should only be used during controlled cleanup
    scenarios such as server shutdown or spell reload operations.
