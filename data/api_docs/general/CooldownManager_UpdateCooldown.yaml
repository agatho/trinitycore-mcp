  signature: void CooldownManager::UpdateCooldown(CooldownInfo & cooldown, uint32
    diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown timer for a specified cooldown entry by the given time
    difference.
  description: The UpdateCooldown method is responsible for advancing the internal
    cooldown timer of a given CooldownInfo object by a specified time interval. This
    method is typically called during game loop updates to decrement active cooldowns,
    allowing abilities or items to become available again. It modifies the cooldown's
    remaining time based on the provided delta time (diff), which usually represents
    milliseconds elapsed since the last update. The method ensures that cooldowns
    are properly tracked and managed within the context of player actions, spell casting,
    and item usage in World of Warcraft.
  parameters:
  - name: cooldown
    description: Reference to a CooldownInfo object representing the specific cooldown
      to be updated. This structure holds information about the cooldown state including
      remaining time, start time, and associated identifier.
  - name: diff
    description: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing the time difference in milliseconds
      since the last cooldown update. This value is used to advance the internal timer
      of the cooldown entry.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cooldown Update
    code: 'CooldownInfo myCooldown;

      myCooldown.remainingTime = 5000; // 5 seconds

      uint32 deltaTime = 1000; // 1 second passed

      cooldownManager.UpdateCooldown(myCooldown, deltaTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Multiple Cooldowns in a Loop
    code: "for (auto& cooldown : playerCooldowns)\n{\n    uint32 deltaTime = 50; //\
      \ 50ms passed\n    cooldownManager.UpdateCooldown(cooldown, deltaTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core cooldown management system in TrinityCore.
    It assumes that the CooldownInfo object has been properly initialized with valid
    data before calling. The implementation likely handles edge cases such as negative
    time differences or zero delta times gracefully.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly on uninitialized CooldownInfo objects,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the diff parameter reflects
    actual elapsed game time for accurate cooldown tracking.
