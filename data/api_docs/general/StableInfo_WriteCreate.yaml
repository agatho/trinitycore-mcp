  signature: void StableInfo::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Writes stable information to a packet buffer for client synchronization
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the stable information of a player's
    pet into a ByteBuffer, preparing it for transmission to either the owner or a
    receiver player. This method is typically used when sending pet stable data to
    clients during login sequences or when transferring pets between players. The
    serialization includes all relevant stable slot information, pet identifiers,
    and associated metadata required for client-side display and interaction with
    stabled pets.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized stable information
      will be written
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object who owns the stable information being
      written
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the stable information
      in the packet
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet preparation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      stableInfo.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to client

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the StableInfo object contains valid stable slot
    data and that both owner and receiver pointers are valid. The method does not
    perform any validation of the input parameters beyond basic null checks. It is
    typically called during packet construction for player login or pet transfer operations.
  warnings: Ensure that the ByteBuffer 'data' has sufficient capacity before calling
    this method to avoid buffer overflows. The method may throw exceptions if serialization
    fails due to invalid data in the StableInfo object.
