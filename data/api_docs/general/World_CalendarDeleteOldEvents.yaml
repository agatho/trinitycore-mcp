  brief: Deletes old calendar events from the world database
  description: The CalendarDeleteOldEvents method removes expired or outdated calendar
    events from the World of Warcraft database. This function is typically called
    periodically by the server to maintain database cleanliness and performance. It
    ensures that old events which have passed their expiration date are purged from
    the system, preventing accumulation of stale data. The method operates on the
    global calendar system and affects all players' event data across the entire realm.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: World::instance()->CalendarDeleteOldEvents();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the server's maintenance
    routines. It may cause temporary database locking during execution, especially
    on servers with a large number of calendar events. The deletion process respects
    event expiration rules and does not remove events that are still active or have
    future dates.
  warnings: Calling this method manually may interfere with the normal maintenance
    schedule. It should only be invoked when necessary for debugging or specific server
    maintenance tasks. Frequent manual calls could impact database performance.
