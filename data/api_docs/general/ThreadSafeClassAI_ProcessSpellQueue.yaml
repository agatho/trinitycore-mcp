  method: ProcessSpellQueue
  signature: void ThreadSafeClassAI::ProcessSpellQueue()
documentation:
  brief: Processes the queued spells for the AI-controlled unit, executing them in
    order based on priority and cooldowns.
  description: The ProcessSpellQueue method handles the execution of spells that have
    been added to the AI's spell queue. This method is typically called during the
    AI's update cycle to ensure that queued spells are cast according to their priority,
    cooldown timers, and other conditions. It manages spell casting logic including
    checking for valid targets, verifying spell readiness, and handling spell-specific
    restrictions such as line of sight or mana requirements. The method ensures thread
    safety when accessing shared spell queues across multiple threads in a multi-threaded
    environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic spell queue processing
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n  \
      \  ProcessSpellQueue();\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should only be called from
    within the AI update loop. It assumes that spell queue management has already
    been handled by other methods such as AddSpellToQueue or RemoveSpellFromQueue.
    The method does not directly manage spell cooldowns but relies on internal state
    tracking of spell readiness.
  warnings: Do not call this method outside of the AI update context, as it may lead
    to race conditions or inconsistent spell execution states. Ensure that all spell
    queue modifications are properly synchronized if accessed from multiple threads.
