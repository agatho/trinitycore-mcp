  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: GetConfig
  signature: FollowConfig & LeaderFollowBehavior::GetConfig()
documentation:
  brief: Returns a reference to the follow configuration settings for the leader-follower
    behavior.
  description: The GetConfig method provides access to the current configuration settings
    that define how a follower behaves in relation to its leader. This includes parameters
    such as follow distance, formation type, and movement restrictions. The returned
    reference allows direct modification of these settings, which can affect the behavior
    of the AI-controlled unit immediately. This method is typically used within the
    context of AI decision-making loops where dynamic adjustments to follower behavior
    are required based on environmental conditions or combat state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to a FollowConfig object containing all current configuration
    parameters for the leader-follower behavior. Modifications to this reference directly
    affect the behavior settings of the associated follower unit.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing and modifying follow configuration
    code: 'FollowConfig& config = leaderFollowBehavior.GetConfig();

      config.followDistance = 5.0f;

      config.formationType = FollowFormation::LINE;'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reading current follow configuration values
    code: "const FollowConfig& config = leaderFollowBehavior.GetConfig();\nif (config.followDistance\
      \ > 10.0f)\n{\n    // Handle special case for distant following\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to an internal configuration object managed
    by the LeaderFollowBehavior instance. Changes made through this reference are
    immediately reflected in the behavior of the follower unit. This method should
    be used carefully in multi-threaded contexts as direct access to shared configuration
    data may lead to race conditions.
  warnings: Modifying the configuration returned by this method affects the behavior
    of all followers using that configuration. Be cautious when making changes during
    active combat or movement scenarios, as sudden changes might cause unexpected
    behavior in AI units.
