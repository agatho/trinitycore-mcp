  class: GroupIntegration
  method: RemoveBotFromGroup
  signature: void GroupIntegration::RemoveBotFromGroup(Group * group, uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified bot from a group in the World of Warcraft instance.
  description: The RemoveBotFromGroup method is responsible for removing a bot character,
    identified by its GUID, from a specified group within the TrinityCore framework.
    This function ensures that the bot is properly ejected from the group, updating
    internal group structures and notifying relevant systems. It is typically used
    in automated bot management systems where bots need to be dynamically added or
    removed from player groups. The method assumes that the group exists and contains
    the specified bot; otherwise, behavior may be undefined. This operation affects
    group composition and can trigger updates to group loot settings, roles, and other
    group-related mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object from which the bot will be removed. Must
      be a valid group instance; null pointer results in undefined behavior.
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character to be removed from
      the group. Must correspond to an existing bot within the group, otherwise the
      operation may fail silently or cause inconsistencies.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);

      uint32 botGuid = 123456;

      GroupIntegration::RemoveBotFromGroup(myGroup, botGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe Removal with Validation
    code: "if (Group* group = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId))\n{\n    if (group->IsMember(botGuid))\n\
      \    {\n        GroupIntegration::RemoveBotFromGroup(group, botGuid);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal group state and should be called carefully
    to avoid race conditions in multi-threaded environments. Ensure that the group
    pointer is valid before calling this function. The removal process may also trigger
    updates to group loot settings or roles, so it's important to ensure proper synchronization
    if other systems depend on these values.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or a botGuid not present
    in the group can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate inputs
    before invoking this function. Additionally, removing bots from groups may affect
    gameplay mechanics such as loot distribution or quest progression if the bot was
    participating in those activities.
