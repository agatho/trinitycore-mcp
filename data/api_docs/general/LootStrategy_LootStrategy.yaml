  brief: Initializes a new LootStrategy instance with default settings and configurations.
  description: The LootStrategy constructor initializes a new loot strategy object,
    setting up internal data structures and default parameters for determining how
    loot should be distributed among players in a group or raid. This method is typically
    called when creating a new loot system instance, such as during the initialization
    of a creature's loot table or when establishing a new group loot policy. The constructor
    ensures that all necessary variables are properly initialized before any loot
    distribution logic can be executed. It sets up default values for loot rules,
    priority systems, and distribution methods that govern how items are awarded to
    players.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new LootStrategy instance
    code: 'LootStrategy strategy;

      // This creates a new loot strategy with default settings

      // The constructor initializes internal state for loot distribution'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a constructor method, so it does not return a value but rather initializes
    the object's state. Developers should be aware that this constructor may perform
    initialization operations that could impact performance if called frequently in
    tight loops. The initialized strategy will contain default loot distribution rules
    that can be modified through other methods after construction.
