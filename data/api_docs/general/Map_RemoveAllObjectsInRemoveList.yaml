  signature: void Map::RemoveAllObjectsInRemoveList()
documentation:
  brief: Removes all objects from the map's remove list, cleaning up entities marked
    for deletion.
  description: The RemoveAllObjectsInRemoveList method processes and removes all game
    objects that have been marked for removal from the map. This typically occurs
    during the map's update cycle when objects such as creatures, game objects, or
    dynamic objects that are scheduled for deletion are actually removed from the
    world. The method iterates through the internal remove list, which contains pointers
    to objects flagged for destruction, and performs necessary cleanup operations
    including removing them from spatial partitioning systems, clearing references,
    and invoking destruction callbacks. This is a core part of TrinityCore's object
    lifecycle management system and ensures that memory is properly freed and world
    state remains consistent.

  - title: Basic usage in map update loop
    code: "void Map::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n \
      \   RemoveAllObjectsInRemoveList();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the map's update loop and should
    not be invoked manually in most cases. It's important to understand that objects
    are only marked for removal during the update cycle, and this method actually
    executes the removal process. The operation is generally fast but can be more
    expensive if many objects are pending removal.
