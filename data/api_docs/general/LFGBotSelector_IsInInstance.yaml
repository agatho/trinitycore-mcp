  class: LFGBotSelector
  method: IsInInstance
  signature: bool LFGBotSelector::IsInInstance(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified bot player is currently inside an instance
    world.
  description: The IsInInstance method checks if the provided Player object, representing
    a bot character, is located within an instance zone rather than in a regular world
    area. This function is crucial for LFG (Looking For Group) bot logic to ensure
    that bots are only considered for group activities when they are in appropriate
    locations. The method evaluates the player's current map and zone context to make
    this determination. It returns true if the bot is inside an instance, such as
    a dungeon, raid, or battleground, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: A pointer to the Player object representing the bot character whose
      instance status needs to be checked. This parameter must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the specified bot player is currently inside an instance
    world (such as a dungeon, raid, or battleground), and false if the bot is in a
    regular world area or not in any valid location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot is in instance
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Assume this points to a valid bot player\nif (LFGBotSelector::IsInInstance(myBot))\
      \ {\n    // Bot is in an instance, proceed with instance-specific logic\n  \
      \  LOG_DEBUG(\"lfg\", \"Bot {} is in an instance.\", myBot->GetName());\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Bot is not in an instance\n    LOG_DEBUG(\"lfg\", \"Bot {} is not\
      \ in an instance.\", myBot->GetName());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state of the player's current map and
    zone information. It may be affected by map loading or teleportation events that
    occur during gameplay. The implementation likely uses internal TrinityCore APIs
    to determine if a player is in an instance context.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as passing a null pointer could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Also
    note that the result of this check may change dynamically during gameplay if the
    bot teleports between zones.
