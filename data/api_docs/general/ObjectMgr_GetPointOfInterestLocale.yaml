documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the locale-specific data for a point of interest by its identifier.
  description: The GetPointOfInterestLocale method fetches the localized information
    associated with a specific point of interest (POI) from the database. Points of
    interest are used in World of Warcraft to mark locations such as quest givers,
    vendors, or notable landmarks. This method returns a const pointer to a PointOfInterestLocale
    structure which contains string data localized for different languages. The method
    performs a lookup based on the provided ID and is typically used when displaying
    POI names or descriptions in the player's current language. It is thread-safe
    as it accesses read-only data structures within the ObjectMgr singleton.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const pointer to a PointOfInterestLocale structure containing localized
    strings for the specified point of interest ID, or nullptr if no matching POI
    is found in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and Display POI Locale Data
    code: "const PointOfInterestLocale* poiLocale = sObjectMgr->GetPointOfInterestLocale(1234);\n\
      if (poiLocale)\n{\n    printf(\"POI Name: %s\\n\", poiLocale->IconName.c_str());\n\
      \    printf(\"POI Description: %s\\n\", poiLocale->Description.c_str());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal data structures that are populated during server
    startup from the 'points_of_interest_locale' database table. It is recommended
    to cache results if frequently accessed to improve performance, especially in
    high-frequency operations like UI updates.
