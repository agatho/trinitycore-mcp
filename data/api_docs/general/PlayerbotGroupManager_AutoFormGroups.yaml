documentation:
  brief: Automatically forms player groups based on configured criteria and bot behavior
    settings.
  description: The AutoFormGroups method is responsible for automatically creating
    and managing player groups within the TrinityCore playerbot system. It evaluates
    the current state of available bots, their roles, and configured group formation
    rules to form logical groups that optimize gameplay efficiency. This method typically
    runs during bot initialization or when new bots join the system, ensuring that
    players are organized into appropriate teams based on factors such as level ranges,
    class distribution, and group objectives. The method does not require explicit
    parameters as it operates on internal bot manager state and configuration settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Manager Initialization
    code: "void InitializeBotManager()\n{\n    // ...\n    playerbotGroupManager->AutoFormGroups();\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on the internal state of the PlayerbotAI system
    and configuration files. It should only be called after all bots have been initialized
    and configured properly. The actual group formation logic may vary depending on
    the specific playerbot AI implementation and server settings.
  warnings: Calling this method before bots are fully initialized may result in empty
    or improperly formed groups. Avoid calling it repeatedly in tight loops as it
    may cause performance issues due to frequent group reevaluation.
