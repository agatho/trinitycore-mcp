  class: QuestCompletion
  method: GetHighestPriorityQuest
  signature: uint32 QuestCompletion::GetHighestPriorityQuest(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines and returns the quest ID with the highest priority for a given
    player bot.
  description: The GetHighestPriorityQuest method evaluates all available quests for
    a specified player bot and identifies the one with the highest priority based
    on game logic. This typically involves checking quest completion status, prerequisites,
    level requirements, and other factors that determine quest priority within the
    TrinityCore framework. The method is commonly used in AI systems or quest management
    modules to guide bot behavior by selecting the most appropriate quest to pursue
    next. It assumes the player bot has a valid session and active quest data within
    the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the unique identifier (ID) of the highest
    priority quest for the specified player bot. If no suitable quest is found, it
    may return 0, indicating no valid quest exists or an error occurred during evaluation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is initialized\nuint32 highestQuestId\
      \ = QuestCompletion::GetHighestPriorityQuest(bot);\nif (highestQuestId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with quest handling logic\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"player.quest\"\
      , \"Bot %u has highest priority quest ID: %u\", bot->GetGUID().GetCounter(),\
      \ highestQuestId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may
    cache results for performance. It's designed to be called within the context of
    a player's active session and assumes valid player data structures are present.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing an invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior or
    crashes. The method may return 0 even when quests exist if they do not meet priority
    criteria.
