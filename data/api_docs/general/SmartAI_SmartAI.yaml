  class: SmartAI
  method: SmartAI
  signature: void SmartAI::SmartAI(Creature * creature, uint32 scriptId)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a SmartAI instance for a creature with the specified script ID.
  description: The SmartAI constructor initializes the AI system for a Creature object,
    associating it with a specific script ID. This method sets up the internal state
    and data structures required for the SmartAI to function properly. It is typically
    called during creature creation or loading from the database. The script ID determines
    which set of smart scripts will be executed by this AI instance. This initialization
    process ensures that the creature's behavior is governed by the defined smart
    AI logic rather than default AI behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to the Creature object that will be controlled by this SmartAI
      instance. Must not be null and must represent a valid creature in the game world.
  - name: scriptId
    description: Unique identifier for the smart script associated with this creature.
      This ID maps to a set of AI actions defined in the smart_scripts table. Must
      be a valid script ID that exists in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic SmartAI Initialization
    code: 'Creature* myCreature = ...; // Valid creature pointer

      uint32 scriptId = 12345;

      SmartAI* ai = new SmartAI(myCreature, scriptId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing SmartAI with Dynamic Script ID
    code: 'Creature* npc = player->SummonCreature(12345, position, TEMPSUMMON_CORPSE_DESPAWN);

      uint32 dynamicScriptId = GetScriptIdForNpc(npc->GetEntry());

      SmartAI* ai = new SmartAI(npc, dynamicScriptId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per creature instance. The SmartAI
    system relies on the script ID to determine which actions to perform, so it's
    important that this ID correctly maps to existing smart scripts in the database.
    The creature parameter must remain valid for the lifetime of the SmartAI object.
  warnings: Passing a null creature pointer or an invalid script ID can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the creature is properly initialized and registered
    with the world before calling this constructor. Avoid creating multiple SmartAI
    instances for the same creature as it may cause memory leaks or conflicting AI
    states.
