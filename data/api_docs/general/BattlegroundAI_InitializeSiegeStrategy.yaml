  method: InitializeSiegeStrategy
  signature: void BattlegroundAI::InitializeSiegeStrategy()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the siege strategy for the battleground, setting up core mechanics
    and behavior for siege-based objectives.
  description: The InitializeSiegeStrategy method is responsible for setting up the
    foundational logic and state management required for siege-based battleground
    mechanics. This includes initializing siege object states, configuring objective
    behaviors, and preparing the AI for handling siege-related events such as tower
    captures, wall repairs, and resource management. The method ensures that all necessary
    data structures are properly initialized before the battleground begins active
    gameplay, establishing the groundwork for dynamic siege interactions between teams.
    It typically runs during battleground initialization and prepares internal systems
    to handle siege-specific game mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: "void MyBattleground::HandleBGInit()\n{\n    m_bgAI->InitializeSiegeStrategy();\n\
      \    // Other initialization code\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during battleground setup phases and not
    during active gameplay. It's typically invoked once at the beginning of a battleground
    instance to prepare all siege-related systems.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of proper initialization context may lead
    to undefined behavior or system instability. Ensure that all prerequisite systems
    are ready before invoking this method.
