  brief: Sets the player's homebind location and area ID
  description: The SetHomebind method configures a player's homebind location, which
    determines where they will be teleported when dying. This method is typically
    used during character creation or when changing homebind locations. The method
    updates both the location coordinates and area ID for the player's homebind, ensuring
    proper game mechanics behavior for resurrection and teleportation.
  parameters:
  - name: loc
    description: The location coordinates where the player's homebind is set. This
      represents the X, Y, Z coordinates of the bind location.
  - name: areaId
    description: The area ID associated with the homebind location. This determines
      the zone or area where the player will be teleported upon death.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetHomebind(1234, 5678);

      // Sets homebind to coordinates 1234 with area ID 5678'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method updates the player's homebind information in the database and
    client-side data structures. It should be called only when necessary, as it affects
    game mechanics related to resurrection and teleportation.
  warnings: This method should not be used during active gameplay sessions unless
    specifically required. Improper use can cause incorrect teleportation behavior
    upon death.
