  class: Unit
  method: SetModTimeRate
  signature: void Unit::SetModTimeRate(float timeRate)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the time rate modifier for the unit, affecting movement and animation
    speed.
  description: This method modifies the time rate of a Unit, which controls how fast
    or slow movement and animations occur. It's commonly used to adjust the speed
    of creatures or players during gameplay, such as when applying effects like slow
    or haste. The time rate is typically a value between 0.0 and 2.0, where values
    less than 1.0 slow down movement and greater than 1.0 speed up movement. This
    method affects all movement-related behaviors including walking, running, and
    casting speeds.
  parameters:
  - name: timeRate
    description: The new time rate value to set for the unit. Valid range is typically
      0.0 to 2.0, where values less than 1.0 slow down movement and values greater
      than 1.0 speed up movement.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetModTimeRate(1.5f);

      // This will increase the unit''s movement speed by 50%'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage with effect application
    code: 'Unit* unit = new Unit();

      unit->SetModTimeRate(0.5f);

      // This will halve the unit''s movement speed

      // Useful for applying "slow" effects or similar gameplay mechanics'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other time-related modifiers
    and should be carefully managed to avoid unintended side effects. The change affects
    all movement behaviors including walking, running, and casting speeds. Performance
    considerations include potential impact on client-side calculations when applied
    to player units.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to unexpected behavior in movement
    speed or animation timing. It's important to ensure that time rate values are
    within valid ranges (0.0 to 2.0) to avoid game-breaking effects.
