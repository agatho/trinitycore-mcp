  class: WarriorAI
  method: GetNearbyEnemyCount
  signature: uint32 WarriorAI::GetNearbyEnemyCount(float range) const
documentation:
  brief: Counts the number of nearby enemy units within a specified range.
  description: The GetNearbyEnemyCount method calculates and returns the total number
    of hostile units (enemies) that are currently within the specified range of the
    warrior AI's unit. This method is typically used by AI logic to make tactical
    decisions, such as determining whether to use certain abilities or engage in combat.
    The range parameter defines the maximum distance from the AI unit at which enemies
    will be counted. This method does not consider line-of-sight or other environmental
    factors; it simply checks proximity.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum distance (in yards) from the warrior AI's unit to consider
      for enemy detection. Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the number of enemy units found within the
    specified range. Returns 0 if no enemies are detected.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 nearbyEnemies = warriorAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Tactical Decision Making
    code: "if (warriorAI->GetNearbyEnemyCount(5.0f) >= 3)\n{\n    // Use a AoE ability\n\
      \    warriorAI->DoAction(WARRIOR_ACTION_USE_WHIRLWIND);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may be computationally expensive if called frequently or with
    large ranges, as it iterates through all units in the vicinity. It is recommended
    to cache results when possible and avoid calling this method every tick unless
    necessary.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is positive; negative values may lead
    to undefined behavior or incorrect counts. This method does not account for obstacles
    or line-of-sight, so it may include enemies that are visually blocked.
