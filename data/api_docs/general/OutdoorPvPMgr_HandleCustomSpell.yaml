  brief: Processes a custom spell cast by a player on a game object within an outdoor
    PvP area
  description: The HandleCustomSpell method is responsible for managing custom spell
    interactions within Outdoor PvP zones. It validates whether a player's spell cast
    on a specific game object should trigger special outdoor PvP mechanics or events.
    This method typically handles spells that are unique to outdoor PvP environments,
    such as capturing territories, triggering objectives, or activating special game
    mechanics tied to the outdoor PvP system. The method checks if the provided spell
    ID and game object combination is valid for outdoor PvP processing and returns
    true if the spell was successfully handled, false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object who cast the spell. Must be a valid
      player instance within an outdoor PvP zone.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell being cast. Should correspond to a custom outdoor
      PvP spell defined in the game's spell database.
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to the GameObject on which the spell was cast. Must be a
      valid game object within the outdoor PvP area.
  returns: Returns true if the custom spell was successfully processed and handled
    by the outdoor PvP system, false if the spell could not be processed or is not
    a valid outdoor PvP spell.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sOutdoorPvPMgr->HandleCustomSpell(player, 12345, gameObject)) {\n \
      \   // Spell was handled by outdoor PvP system\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"\
      Spell processed by Outdoor PvP\");\n} else {\n    // Spell was not handled\n\
      \    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"Spell not valid for Outdoor PvP\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: "void Player::HandleOutdoorPvPSpellCast(uint32 spellId, GameObject* go)\
      \ {\n    if (sOutdoorPvPMgr->HandleCustomSpell(this, spellId, go)) {\n     \
      \   // Update outdoor PvP state\n        UpdateOutdoorPvPState();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from the core spell handling system when
    a player casts a spell on a game object within an outdoor PvP zone. The method
    assumes that the player and game object are already validated to be in the correct
    outdoor PvP area. It's important to note that this method only processes spells
    specifically designed for outdoor PvP mechanics, not regular player spells.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly with invalid player or game object pointers
    as it may lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Ensure that the spell ID corresponds
    to a valid outdoor PvP spell before calling this method. The method does not perform
    any validation on the player's current zone or outdoor PvP status, so external
    checks should be performed.
