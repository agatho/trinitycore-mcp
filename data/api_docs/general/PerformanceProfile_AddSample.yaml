  class: PerformanceProfile
  method: AddSample
  signature: void PerformanceProfile::AddSample(const PerformanceSample & sample)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a performance sample to the profile for tracking and analysis.
  description: The AddSample method is used to record a PerformanceSample within a
    PerformanceProfile instance. This allows developers to track various performance
    metrics such as execution times, memory usage, or other relevant data points during
    runtime. The method typically stores the provided sample in an internal collection
    or buffer that can later be analyzed for profiling purposes. It's commonly used
    in debugging and optimization efforts within the TrinityCore framework to monitor
    subsystem performance.
  parameters:
  - name: sample
    description: The PerformanceSample object containing timing or metric data to
      be added to the profile. This parameter must be a valid PerformanceSample instance
      with properly initialized data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'PerformanceProfile profile;

      PerformanceSample sample;

      sample.SetDuration(100); // Set duration in milliseconds

      profile.AddSample(sample);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adding Multiple Samples
    code: "PerformanceProfile profile;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n{\n    PerformanceSample\
      \ sample;\n    sample.SetDuration(i * 10);\n    profile.AddSample(sample);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in performance-critical sections of code where
    timing measurements are needed. The samples added may be stored in a circular
    buffer or similar structure to prevent memory overflow, depending on the implementation
    details of PerformanceProfile.
  warnings: Ensure that the PerformanceSample object passed to this method is properly
    initialized before calling AddSample, as invalid data could lead to incorrect
    profiling results or runtime errors.
