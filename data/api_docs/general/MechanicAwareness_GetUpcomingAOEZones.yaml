  method: GetUpcomingAOEZones
  signature: int MechanicAwareness::GetUpcomingAOEZones(uint32 timeWindow) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of upcoming AoE zones within a specified
    time window for mechanic awareness.
  description: The GetUpcomingAOEZones method determines how many area-of-effect (AoE)
    spell zones are expected to occur within a given time frame. This functionality
    is crucial for AI-driven character behavior, particularly in scenarios where players
    or NPCs need to anticipate dangerous environmental effects. The method evaluates
    the internal tracking of mechanic events and returns a count based on the provided
    time window parameter. It's typically used by AI systems to make informed decisions
    about movement, positioning, or spell casting to avoid incoming AoE attacks.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of upcoming AoE zones detected within
    the specified time window. A return value of zero indicates no imminent AoE threats,
    while a positive integer signifies the count of expected AoE events.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check for Immediate AoE Threats
    code: "int upcomingZones = mechanicAwareness->GetUpcomingAOEZones(5000); // Check\
      \ for AoEs in next 5 seconds\nif (upcomingZones > 0)\n{\n    // Player should\
      \ prepare to move away from potential AoE zones\n    // Implement avoidance\
      \ behavior here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using the Result for Strategic Decision Making
    code: "uint32 timeWindow = 10000; // 10 seconds\nint zones = mechanicAwareness->GetUpcomingAOEZones(timeWindow);\n\
      if (zones >= 3)\n{\n    // High threat level - consider using defensive cooldowns\
      \ or fleeing\n    player->CastSpell(player, SPELL_DIVINE_SHIELD, true);\n}\n\
      else if (zones >= 1)\n{\n    // Moderate threat - prepare for movement\n   \
      \ player->SetMovementFlag(MOVEFLAG_BACKWARD);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal tracking of mechanic events and may not reflect
    real-time changes if the underlying event system isn't updated frequently. The
    accuracy of the returned count depends on how well the game's AI system maintains
    its awareness of upcoming AoE mechanics.
  warnings: The method assumes that all relevant AoE zones have been properly registered
    with the MechanicAwareness system. If certain mechanics are not tracked, the result
    may be inaccurate or incomplete. Additionally, this method should not be called
    excessively in performance-critical code paths due to potential internal processing
    overhead.
