  class: NeuralNetwork
  method: Softmax
  signature: int NeuralNetwork::Softmax(const int & input) const
documentation:
  brief: Applies the softmax activation function to the neural network's input layer
    and returns the index of the highest probability output.
  description: The Softmax method computes the softmax activation function across
    the neural network's input layer, transforming raw scores into probabilities that
    sum to one. This is commonly used in machine learning models for multi-class classification
    tasks where the output represents the probability distribution over possible classes.
    In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this method likely serves as a decision-making
    mechanism for NPC behavior or pathfinding algorithms. The method takes no parameters
    and returns an integer representing the index of the highest probability value
    from the softmax computation. The neural network must be properly initialized
    before calling this method; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the index of the highest probability output
    after applying the softmax function. This typically corresponds to the predicted
    class or action in a classification task.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'int result = neuralNetwork.Softmax();

      // Returns the index of the highest probability output

      // e.g., if outputs are [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], returns 1'
    language: cpp
  notes: The Softmax method assumes that the neural network's input layer has been
    properly initialized with valid data. The implementation may involve floating-point
    arithmetic which could introduce precision errors in certain edge cases. Performance
    is dependent on the size of the input layer and the computational complexity of
    the softmax function.
  warnings: This method should only be called after ensuring that the neural network
    has been properly trained or initialized with valid weights and biases. Calling
    Softmax on an uninitialized or improperly configured neural network may result
    in incorrect outputs or runtime errors.
