documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the group bonus multiplier for quest rewards based
    on the number of players in the group.
  description: The CalculateGroupBonus method determines the reward multiplier applied
    to quest rewards when a player completes a quest while in a group. This multiplier
    is calculated based on the size of the group and ensures that larger groups receive
    proportionally smaller individual rewards, maintaining game balance. The method
    takes into account the current quest being evaluated and returns a float value
    representing the bonus multiplier. A return value of 1.0 indicates no group bonus,
    while values greater than 1.0 indicate an increased reward for solo play, and
    values less than 1.0 represent reduced individual rewards for group play.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the group bonus multiplier. Values typically
    range from 0.5 to 2.0, where 1.0 indicates no bonus, values below 1.0 indicate
    reduced rewards for group play, and values above 1.0 indicate increased rewards
    for solo play.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in quest completion
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, Quest const* quest)\n{\n    float\
      \ bonus = sObjectMgr->GetQuestManager()->CalculateGroupBonus(quest);\n    //\
      \ Apply bonus to reward calculations\n    uint32 goldReward = quest->GetRewMoney()\
      \ * bonus;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest completion processing to adjust
    reward values. The calculation considers the current group size and applies predefined
    multipliers that are configurable in the game's configuration files. The method
    does not modify any internal state and is purely a calculation function.
  warnings: The returned bonus value may vary significantly based on group composition,
    so reward calculations should account for potential non-linear scaling effects.
    This method assumes the player is in a valid group context when called.
