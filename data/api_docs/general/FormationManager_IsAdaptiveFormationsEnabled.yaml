  signature: bool FormationManager::IsAdaptiveFormationsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether adaptive formations are enabled in the FormationManager.
  description: The IsAdaptiveFormationsEnabled method returns a boolean value indicating
    if the adaptive formations feature is currently active within the FormationManager.
    This feature typically controls dynamic group positioning and formation adjustments
    based on combat conditions, player behavior, or other game mechanics. The method
    performs no side effects and simply queries the internal state of the FormationManager
    to determine this configuration setting.
  parameters: []
  returns: 'A boolean value: true if adaptive formations are enabled, false otherwise.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (formationManager.IsAdaptiveFormationsEnabled()) {\n    // Adaptive\
      \ formations are active\n    // Perform actions accordingly\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logic Based on Setting
    code: "bool adaptiveEnabled = formationManager.IsAdaptiveFormationsEnabled();\n\
      if (adaptiveEnabled) {\n    // Enable dynamic formation adjustments\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Use static formations only\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other formation-related
    methods to control how creatures or players dynamically adjust their positioning
    during combat. It's a read-only query that does not modify any internal state.
