  class: BotSpellCastRequest
  method: BotSpellCastRequest
  signature: void BotSpellCastRequest::BotSpellCastRequest(int spell, int * tgt)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a bot spell casting request for the specified spell and target.
  description: The BotSpellCastRequest method is used to queue or initiate a spell
    cast action by a bot character. This method takes a spell ID and a pointer to
    a target, which could be a unit or object in the game world. The method likely
    handles the logic required to prepare and execute the spell casting sequence,
    including validation of the spell, target, and caster state. It is typically used
    within AI systems for bots to perform actions like attacking, healing, or buffing
    based on their programmed behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: spell
    description: The ID of the spell to be cast. This corresponds to the Spell ID
      defined in the game's spell database.
  - name: tgt
    description: Pointer to the target unit or object for the spell. Can be null if
      the spell targets self or is area-of-effect.
  returns: None. This method performs an action and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Spell Cast Request
    code: BotSpellCastRequest(12345, &targetUnit);
    language: cpp
  - title: Self-Cast Spell with Null Target
    code: BotSpellCastRequest(67890, nullptr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI system and should only be called from within
    a bot's AI logic. The target pointer must be valid when the spell requires a specific
    target, otherwise it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID exists in the database and that the target pointer
    is properly initialized before calling this method. Incorrect usage can cause
    the bot to perform invalid actions or crash the game server.
