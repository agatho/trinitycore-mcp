  brief: Clears all text repeat groups for a creature
  description: This method clears all text repeat groups associated with a creature,
    effectively removing any previously set text group entries from the creature's
    AI. It is used to reset the creature's text repeat behavior, allowing for new
    text groups to be assigned or ensuring that existing text groups are properly
    cleared before reassigning them. The method operates on the creature's internal
    text repeat group data structure, which is part of the creature's AI system.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Clear text repeat group for a creature
    code: 'Creature* creature = GetCreature();

      creature->ClearTextRepeatGroup(0);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it affects the creature's AI behavior.
    The method is typically called during creature initialization or when resetting
    text groups to ensure proper behavior.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect text group behavior
    in creature AI, potentially causing unexpected NPC behavior or missing text entries.
