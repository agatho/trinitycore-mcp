documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit has a crowd control aura that can be broken by damage.
  description: This method determines whether the current unit possesses any crowd
    control auras that are susceptible to being broken by incoming damage. It is commonly
    used in game mechanics to identify when a target can be disrupted by damage-based
    effects, such as those from spells like 'Shattering' or 'Sundering'. The method
    returns true if any breakable crowd control aura exists on the unit, and false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for determining whether certain abilities
    can interrupt or break existing crowd control effects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit has a breakable crowd control aura that can be
    broken by damage, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "if (unit->HasBreakableByDamageCrowdControlAura()) {\n    // Unit can be\
      \ disrupted by damage\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method typically checks for specific types of crowd control effects
    such as those from spells like 'Fear', 'Stun', 'Root', or 'Silence'. It is important
    to note that the method does not consider all possible crowd control types, but
    rather focuses on those that can be broken by damage.
  warnings: This method may not account for all possible crowd control effects in
    the game mechanics. Developers should ensure that this method is used in conjunction
    with other relevant methods to fully understand a unit's crowd control status.
