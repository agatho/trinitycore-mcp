  method: GetCurrentPhaseConfig
  signature: const PhaseConfig * StartupSpawnOrchestrator::GetCurrentPhaseConfig()
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configuration data for the current phase of startup spawning.
  description: The GetCurrentPhaseConfig method returns a pointer to the PhaseConfig
    object that defines the current phase of the startup spawn orchestration process.
    This configuration includes settings such as spawn timing, groupings, and conditional
    logic that govern how game objects or creatures are initialized during server
    startup. The returned pointer is const, ensuring that the configuration data cannot
    be modified through this interface. This method is typically used by the TrinityCore
    server's initialization system to determine how to proceed with spawning entities
    based on the current phase settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to a PhaseConfig object representing the current phase's
    configuration settings, or nullptr if no phase configuration is active or available.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Current Phase Configuration
    code: "const PhaseConfig* config = orchestrator.GetCurrentPhaseConfig();\nif (config\
      \ != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use config->SpawnDelay, config->GroupSize, etc.\n \
      \   LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Current spawn delay: {}\", config->SpawnDelay);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned PhaseConfig pointer is valid only during the lifetime of the
    StartupSpawnOrchestrator instance and should not be stored or used beyond that
    scope. The method does not perform any locking or synchronization internally,
    so access should be coordinated if used from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method when no phase configuration is active may return a
    nullptr, which must be checked to avoid null pointer dereference errors. Additionally,
    because the returned object is const, attempting to modify its contents through
    this interface will result in compilation errors.
