documentation:
  brief: Handles client requests for quest completion NPC data, retrieving and sending
    relevant quest-related NPC information to the player.
  description: The HandleQueryQuestCompletionNPCs method processes incoming client
    packets requesting information about NPCs associated with quest completions. This
    method is part of the WorldSession's packet handling system and responds to queries
    from the game client for quest-related NPC data, typically used when a player
    interacts with quest givers or checks quest progress. The method retrieves relevant
    quest completion NPC entries from the database and sends them back to the client
    in a structured format. It ensures that players can see which NPCs they need to
    interact with to complete specific quests, supporting core gameplay mechanics
    related to quest progression and NPC interaction.

  - title: Basic usage in packet handling
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueryQuestCompletionNPCs(WorldPackets::Query::QueryQuestCompletionNPCs&\
      \ queryQuestCompletionNPCs)\n{\n    // Process the incoming quest completion\
      \ NPC query\n    // Retrieve relevant NPC data from database\n    // Send response\
      \ back to client\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of TrinityCore's core packet handling system and operates
    within the context of WorldSession. It requires proper database connectivity to
    fetch quest completion NPC information. The method likely interacts with the quest
    system's internal data structures to determine which NPCs are relevant for quest
    completion.
