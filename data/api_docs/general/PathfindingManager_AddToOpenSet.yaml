  method: AddToOpenSet
  signature: void PathfindingManager::AddToOpenSet(PathNode * node, int & openSet)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a pathfinding node to the open set for path exploration
  description: The AddToOpenSet method is responsible for inserting a PathNode into
    the open set data structure used by the pathfinding algorithm. This operation
    is crucial for the A* pathfinding implementation, where nodes in the open set
    represent potential paths to explore. The method updates the open set index reference
    and ensures proper node ordering based on heuristic values. It plays a fundamental
    role in the pathfinding process by managing which nodes are considered next during
    the search.
  parameters:
  - name: node
    description: Pointer to the PathNode object to be added to the open set. This
      node represents a position in the navigation mesh that is being considered for
      path exploration.
  - name: openSet
    description: Reference to an integer representing the current size or index of
      the open set. This parameter is updated by the method to reflect the new state
      of the open set after adding the node.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pathfinding
    code: 'PathNode* newNode = new PathNode(x, y, z);

      int openSetSize = m_openSet.size();

      pathfindingManager->AddToOpenSet(newNode, openSetSize);

      m_openSet.push_back(newNode);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with A* pathfinding loop
    code: "while (!openSet.empty()) {\n    PathNode* currentNode = GetLowestFValueNode(openSet);\n\
      \    if (currentNode->IsGoal()) break;\n    \n    // Process neighbors\n   \
      \ for (auto& neighbor : currentNode->GetNeighbors()) {\n        int openSetSize\
      \ = openSet.size();\n        pathfindingManager->AddToOpenSet(neighbor, openSetSize);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of A* pathfinding.
    The openSet parameter should be properly managed to maintain accurate indexing.
    The method assumes that node memory management is handled externally and does
    not perform automatic allocation or deallocation.
  warnings: Ensure that the node pointer passed is valid and properly initialized
    before calling this method. Improper handling of the openSet reference can lead
    to incorrect pathfinding behavior or memory corruption. This method should only
    be called during active pathfinding operations.
