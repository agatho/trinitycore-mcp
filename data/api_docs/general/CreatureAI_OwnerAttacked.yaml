  class: CreatureAI
  method: OwnerAttacked
  signature: void CreatureAI::OwnerAttacked(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when the creature's owner is attacked by a target.
  description: The OwnerAttacked method is invoked in CreatureAI to notify the AI
    that the creature's owner has been attacked. This method typically triggers defensive
    behaviors or responses from the creature, such as aggroing the attacker or initiating
    combat actions. It is part of the AI system's event handling mechanism and is
    called when the owner's health decreases due to an attack. The method does not
    directly perform any action but rather serves as a callback for custom AI implementations
    to define how the creature should react to its owner being attacked.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target that attacked the creature's
      owner. This value can be used to identify or process the attacking entity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Override in Custom AI
    code: "class MyCreatureAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void OwnerAttacked(int*\
      \ target) override {\n        // Example: Make the creature attack the target\n\
      \        if (target && *target > 0) {\n            AttackStart(*target);\n \
      \       }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within the core AI logic when an event
    occurs that affects the creature's owner. It should be overridden in custom AI
    implementations to define specific behaviors. The parameter 'target' may not always
    contain a valid value, so checking for null or zero values is recommended.
  warnings: Ensure that any override of this method does not cause infinite loops
    or unintended behavior. Be cautious when using the target pointer directly without
    validation, as it could lead to undefined behavior if improperly initialized.
