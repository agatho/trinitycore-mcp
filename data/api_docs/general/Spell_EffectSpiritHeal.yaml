  brief: Executes spirit heal effect to restore health points
  description: The EffectSpiritHeal method performs the spirit heal effect implementation
    within the Spell class, which restores health points to the target player using
    spirit-based healing mechanics. This method is typically invoked during spell
    execution when a spirit heal effect is applied, and it handles the calculation
    and distribution of healing values based on the caster's spirit attributes and
    the target's current health status. The method ensures that healing is properly
    applied according to game mechanics rules, including potential healing modifiers
    and spirit-based calculations.

  notes: This method is typically called during spell execution and requires proper
    initialization of the spell object. Implementation details include handling of
    spirit-based healing calculations, potential healing modifiers, and ensuring correct
    application of healing effects to target player.
  warnings: Improper implementation can lead to incorrect healing values or failure
    to properly restore health points. Care must be taken to ensure that the method
    is called only when appropriate for spirit heal effects.
