  method: CreateCallbackTimer
  signature: std::unique_ptr<class IBotPerformanceTimer> IBotPerformanceMonitor::CreateCallbackTimer()
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a new callback timer instance for performance monitoring.
  description: The CreateCallbackTimer method instantiates a new IBotPerformanceTimer
    object that can be used to measure execution time of specific callbacks or code
    sections within the TrinityCore environment. This timer is designed to integrate
    with the bot performance monitoring system, allowing developers to track how long
    certain operations take and identify potential bottlenecks in bot behavior. The
    returned timer object provides methods to start, stop, and retrieve timing measurements
    for precise performance analysis.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::unique_ptr to an IBotPerformanceTimer instance that can be used
    to monitor the execution time of callback functions or code blocks. The pointer
    is guaranteed to be valid upon successful creation, and will be null if the timer
    could not be initialized due to system constraints or resource limitations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Timer Usage
    code: "auto timer = performanceMonitor->CreateCallbackTimer();\ntimer->Start();\n\
      // Some bot logic here\n timer->Stop();\nstd::cout << \"Execution time: \" <<\
      \ timer->GetElapsedMilliseconds() << \" ms\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned IBotPerformanceTimer instance is designed to be used in a scoped
    manner. It's recommended to call Start() before the code section you want to time
    and Stop() immediately after. The timer automatically handles internal state management
    and provides accurate timing measurements using high-resolution clocks available
    on the system.
