  class: InteractionValidator
  method: CheckLevel
  signature: bool InteractionValidator::CheckLevel(::Player * bot, uint32 minLevel,
    uint32 maxLevel) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player's level is within the specified minimum and maximum bounds.
  description: The CheckLevel method validates whether a given player's current level
    falls within the provided range. It takes a Player object and two level boundaries
    (minimum and maximum) as inputs, returning true if the player's level is inclusively
    between these values, or false otherwise. This validation is commonly used in
    game mechanics such as quest requirements, NPC interactions, or item usage restrictions
    where certain actions are only available to players within specific level ranges.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose level will be checked. Must not
      be null.
  - name: minLevel
    description: The minimum allowed level for the player. Must be a non-negative
      integer.
  - name: maxLevel
    description: The maximum allowed level for the player. Must be a non-negative
      integer and greater than or equal to minLevel.
  returns: Returns true if the player's level is within the inclusive range [minLevel,
    maxLevel], false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Level Check
    code: "if (validator.CheckLevel(player, 10, 20)) {\n    // Player is between levels\
      \ 10 and 20\n    player->SendAreaTriggerMessage(\"You are in the correct level\
      \ range!\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Requirement Validation
    code: "uint32 requiredMinLevel = 15;\nuint32 requiredMaxLevel = 30;\nif (!validator.CheckLevel(player,\
      \ requiredMinLevel, requiredMaxLevel)) {\n    player->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      You must be between levels %u and %u to complete this quest.\", requiredMinLevel,\
      \ requiredMaxLevel);\n    return false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the Player object passed in is valid and has a properly
    initialized level. The method performs no additional checks beyond level validation,
    so it's important to ensure that minLevel <= maxLevel before calling this function.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is not null before invoking this method.
    Passing invalid or uninitialized player objects may lead to undefined behavior.
    Also, be cautious when using very large level ranges as performance could be affected
    in high-frequency validation scenarios.
