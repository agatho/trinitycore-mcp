  class: Map
  method: ResetGridExpiry
  signature: void Map::ResetGridExpiry(int & grid, float factor) const
documentation:
  brief: Resets the grid expiry timer for a specified grid on the map.
  description: The ResetGridExpiry method resets the expiry timer associated with
    a given grid on the map, effectively preventing the grid from being unloaded or
    cleared due to inactivity. This is typically used during player movement or object
    interactions to ensure that relevant grid data remains resident in memory. The
    factor parameter influences how long the grid will remain active before expiring
    again. Grid expiry management is crucial for maintaining performance and memory
    efficiency in the game world, particularly in areas with high player activity
    or frequent object interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: grid
    description: Reference to an integer representing the grid identifier that needs
      its expiry timer reset. This value typically corresponds to a specific grid
      within the map's grid system.
  - name: factor
    description: A float value that modifies the expiry duration of the grid. Higher
      values extend the time before the grid expires, while lower values reduce it.
      A factor of 1.0 maintains the default expiry time.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Grid Expiry for Player Movement
    code: 'int currentGrid = player->GetGridX();

      float expiryFactor = 2.0f;

      map->ResetGridExpiry(currentGrid, expiryFactor);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Grid Expiry with Dynamic Factor Based on Activity
    code: 'int gridId = object->GetGridX();

      float activityLevel = object->GetActivityLevel();

      float factor = 1.0f + (activityLevel * 0.5f);

      map->ResetGridExpiry(gridId, factor);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the map's grid management system and should be called
    whenever a player or object interacts with a specific grid to prevent premature
    unloading. The grid expiry mechanism helps balance memory usage and performance
    by only keeping active grids in memory.
  warnings: Incorrectly using this method or passing invalid grid identifiers may
    result in undefined behavior or memory corruption. Ensure that the grid parameter
    refers to an actual existing grid within the map's grid system.
