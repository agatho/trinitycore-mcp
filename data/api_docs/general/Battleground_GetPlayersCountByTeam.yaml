  class: Battleground
  method: GetPlayersCountByTeam
  signature: int Battleground::GetPlayersCountByTeam(int team) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the number of players on a specified team within the battleground.
  description: The GetPlayersCountByTeam method retrieves the count of players currently
    participating in the battleground who belong to the specified team. This method
    is commonly used during battleground operations to determine team sizes, check
    for balanced teams, or enforce game rules based on player counts. The method accepts
    a team identifier as input and returns an integer representing the number of players
    on that team. It's important to note that this method only considers active players
    in the battleground and does not include spectators or inactive participants.
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier for which to count players. Valid values are
      typically TEAM_ALLIANCE (0) or TEAM_HORDE (1) depending on the battleground
      implementation.
  returns: An integer representing the number of players currently on the specified
    team in the battleground. Returns 0 if no players are found on the team or if
    an invalid team identifier is provided.
  examples:
  - title: Count Players on Alliance Team
    code: "int alliancePlayers = bg->GetPlayersCountByTeam(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\nif (alliancePlayers\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Process alliance team players\n    sLog->outString(\"Alliance\
      \ has %d players\", alliancePlayers);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Team Balance in Battleground
    code: "int allianceCount = bg->GetPlayersCountByTeam(TEAM_ALLIANCE);\nint hordeCount\
      \ = bg->GetPlayersCountByTeam(TEAM_HORDE);\n\nif (abs(allianceCount - hordeCount)\
      \ > 1)\n{\n    // Teams are unbalanced, consider kicking or adding players\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Teams are unbalanced: Alliance=%d, Horde=%d\", allianceCount,\
      \ hordeCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in battleground management code and may be
    called frequently during gameplay. It's important to understand that the returned
    count reflects only players who are actively participating in the battleground,
    not those who have been spectating or are in a different state. The implementation
    likely uses internal tracking structures for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the team parameter passed is valid (typically TEAM_ALLIANCE
    or TEAM_HORDE) to avoid unexpected behavior. This method should not be used during
    battleground initialization or cleanup phases where player lists might be incomplete
    or inconsistent.
