  class: AuraApplication
  method: AuraApplication
  signature: void AuraApplication::AuraApplication(Unit * target, Unit * caster, Aura
    * base, uint32 effMask)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new AuraApplication instance with specified target, caster,
    base aura, and effect mask.
  description: The AuraApplication constructor initializes a new aura application
    object that links a target unit, caster unit, base aura, and effect mask. This
    class represents the application of an aura to a specific unit in the game world.
    The target parameter specifies the unit receiving the aura, the caster parameter
    identifies the unit applying the aura, the base parameter points to the underlying
    aura template, and effMask defines which effects of the aura are active. This
    constructor is typically called internally by the TrinityCore aura system when
    an aura is applied to a unit, ensuring proper linkage between all necessary components
    for aura functionality.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will receive the aura application.
      Must be a valid unit instance or nullptr.
  - name: caster
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that is applying the aura. Can be nullptr
      if the aura has no caster (e.g., passive auras).
  - name: base
    description: Pointer to the Aura object representing the base aura template being
      applied. Must not be nullptr for valid application.
  - name: effMask
    description: Bitmask indicating which effects of the aura are active. Each bit
      corresponds to an effect index, allowing selective activation of aura effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic AuraApplication Initialization
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      Unit* caster = mob;

      Aura* baseAura = new Aura(target, caster, spellInfo);

      uint32 effectMask = 0x01; // Activate first effect

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target, caster, baseAura, effectMask);'
    language: cpp
  - title: AuraApplication with Multiple Effects
    code: 'Unit* target = player;

      Unit* caster = nullptr; // Passive aura

      Aura* baseAura = new Aura(target, caster, spellInfo);

      uint32 effectMask = 0x07; // Activate first three effects (bits 0,1,2)

      AuraApplication* app = new AuraApplication(target, caster, baseAura, effectMask);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is part of the internal aura management system and should
    not typically be called directly by external code. The AuraApplication object
    manages the lifecycle of aura applications and automatically handles linking with
    the target unit's aura list. The effect mask parameter allows for granular control
    over which effects are active, enabling partial application of multi-effect auras.
  warnings: Do not call this constructor directly unless you understand the internal
    aura system architecture. Improper initialization can lead to memory leaks or
    invalid aura states. Always ensure that the base aura pointer is valid and properly
    initialized before creating an AuraApplication instance.
