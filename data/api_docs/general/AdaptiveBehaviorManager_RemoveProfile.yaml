  class: AdaptiveBehaviorManager
  method: RemoveProfile
  signature: void AdaptiveBehaviorManager::RemoveProfile(BehaviorProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specified behavior profile from the adaptive behavior manager's
    collection.
  description: The RemoveProfile method removes a given BehaviorProfile object from
    the internal collection managed by the AdaptiveBehaviorManager. This operation
    typically invalidates any references to the removed profile and may trigger updates
    in AI decision-making logic that relied on the profile. The method assumes the
    profile is valid and has been previously added to the manager. It does not perform
    any validation checks on whether the profile exists before attempting removal.
  parameters:
  - name: profile
    description: Reference to the BehaviorProfile object that should be removed from
      the manager's collection. The profile must have been previously registered with
      the AdaptiveBehaviorManager.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AdaptiveBehaviorManager* behaviorManager = sObjectAccessor->GetPlayer(playerGuid)->GetAI()->GetAdaptiveBehaviorManager();

      BehaviorProfile profile;

      // ... populate profile with data ...

      behaviorManager->RemoveProfile(profile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal data structures such as maps or lists
    that store behavior profiles. Ensure the profile reference is still valid after
    removal to avoid dangling pointer issues. The manager may internally track profile
    usage counts or dependencies, which could affect how removal impacts other systems.
  warnings: Calling RemoveProfile on a profile not previously added to the manager
    may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that the profile exists
    in the manager before calling this method.
