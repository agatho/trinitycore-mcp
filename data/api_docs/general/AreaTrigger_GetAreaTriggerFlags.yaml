documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the flags associated with an area trigger.
  description: The GetAreaTriggerFlags method returns the integer value representing
    the flags set on an area trigger. These flags define various properties and behaviors
    of the area trigger, such as whether it's active, if it should be triggered by
    players or creatures, or if it has specific activation conditions. The returned
    value is typically a bitmask that can be checked against predefined flag constants
    to determine the trigger's behavior. This method is commonly used in custom scripts
    or modifications to control how area triggers interact with game entities and
    events.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the bitmask of flags set on the area trigger.
    Each bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific flag that defines the
    trigger's behavior, such as activation type, visibility, or interaction rules.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an area trigger is active
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...; // Assume this is a valid area trigger\nint\
      \ flags = trigger->GetAreaTriggerFlags();\nif (flags & AREA_TRIGGER_FLAG_ACTIVE)\n\
      {\n    // The area trigger is currently active\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Debug area trigger flags
    code: 'AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;

      int flags = trigger->GetAreaTriggerFlags();

      TC_LOG_DEBUG("area.trigger", "Area Trigger Flags: %d", flags);

      // Output all flag values for debugging purposes'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned integer is a bitmask, so multiple flags can be active simultaneously.
    Developers should use bitwise operations to check individual flags rather than
    direct equality comparisons. The exact meaning of each bit in the flag set depends
    on the game's internal definitions and may vary between different versions or
    custom modifications.
  warnings: Be cautious when modifying area trigger flags directly, as incorrect flag
    values can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Always validate flag values
    before applying them, especially when working with custom scripts that modify
    trigger properties at runtime.
