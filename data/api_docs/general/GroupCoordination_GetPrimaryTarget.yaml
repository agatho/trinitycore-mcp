  class: GroupCoordination
  method: GetPrimaryTarget
  signature: int GroupCoordination::GetPrimaryTarget() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the unique identifier of the group's primary target.
  description: The GetPrimaryTarget method returns the GUID (Global Unique Identifier)
    of the primary target associated with the group coordination. This identifier
    typically represents the main enemy or objective that the group is focused on
    engaging. The method is commonly used in group-based AI logic to determine which
    entity should be prioritized for attacks, targeting, or strategic decisions within
    a group context. It ensures that all group members are aligned on a single primary
    target, which is essential for coordinated gameplay mechanics such as tanking,
    AoE targeting, or quest-related objectives.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer value representing the GUID of the primary target. If no primary
    target is set, the method may return 0 or a special invalid GUID value depending
    on implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int primaryTargetGuid = groupCoordination->GetPrimaryTarget();\nif (primaryTargetGuid\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Process the primary target\n    printf(\"Primary target GUID:\
      \ %d\\n\", primaryTargetGuid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other group coordination
    functions to maintain synchronized targeting behavior across multiple group members.
    The returned value should be validated before use, as it may represent an invalid
    or non-existent target.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupCoordination object is properly initialized and not
    null before calling this method. Improper handling of the returned GUID could
    lead to targeting incorrect entities or accessing invalid memory.
