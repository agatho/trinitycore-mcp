  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: GeneratePerformanceReport
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::GeneratePerformanceReport(std::string &
    report, uint32_t botGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Generates a performance report for a specified bot GUID and stores it in
    the provided string reference.
  description: The GeneratePerformanceReport method creates a detailed performance
    analytics report for a specific bot identified by its GUID. This method collects
    various metrics related to the bot's behavior, such as action execution times,
    resource usage, and performance bottlenecks. The generated report is stored in
    the provided string reference parameter, which should be pre-allocated or empty
    before calling this method. The method operates on the assumption that the bot
    exists within the game world and has active performance data available for analysis.
    This functionality is typically used by administrators or developers to monitor
    and optimize bot behavior in TrinityCore environments.
  parameters:
  - name: report
    description: Reference to a string where the generated performance report will
      be stored. The string is modified in-place with the formatted report content.
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot for which the performance report
      is being generated. Must correspond to an existing bot in the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'std::string report;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      botPerformanceAnalytics.GeneratePerformanceReport(report, botGuid);

      printf("Performance Report:\n%s\n", report.c_str());'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Error Handling
    code: "std::string report;\nuint32_t botGuid = 12345;\ntry {\n    botPerformanceAnalytics.GeneratePerformanceReport(report,\
      \ botGuid);\n    if (!report.empty()) {\n        // Process the generated report\n\
      \        std::cout << \"Report generated successfully:\" << std::endl;\n   \
      \     std::cout << report << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cerr <<\
      \ \"Warning: Empty report generated for bot GUID \" << botGuid << std::endl;\n\
      \    }\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    std::cerr << \"Error generating\
      \ performance report: \" << e.what() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and can be called from multiple
    threads simultaneously without data corruption. The performance report generation
    may involve I/O operations and could have slight delays depending on the amount
    of collected data. It's recommended to call this method during maintenance windows
    or when bot activity is low to minimize impact on server performance.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid actually corresponds to an existing bot
    in the game world, otherwise the behavior is undefined. The report string reference
    should not be null and should be properly initialized before calling this method.
    Repeated calls to this method for the same bot GUID may overwrite previous reports
    without explicit handling.
