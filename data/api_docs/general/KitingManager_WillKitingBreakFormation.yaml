documentation:
  brief: Determines whether kiting movement will cause a unit to break formation
  description: The WillKitingBreakFormation method evaluates if a unit's kiting behavior,
    typically used in combat scenarios where a unit moves while attacking, would result
    in the unit leaving its current formation. This is particularly relevant for AI-controlled
    creatures or player characters that maintain group formations during combat. The
    method considers factors such as distance from formation center, movement speed,
    and formation boundaries to make this determination.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if kiting movement would cause the unit to break formation,
    false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that the current kiting behavior
    is not compatible with maintaining the existing formation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (kitingManager.WillKitingBreakFormation()) {\n    // Switch to a different\
      \ movement strategy\n    unit->SetMovementType(MOVEMENT_TYPE_CHASE);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with formation management
    code: "void UnitAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (kitingManager.IsKiting()\
      \ && kitingManager.WillKitingBreakFormation()) {\n        // Reassess formation\
      \ and potentially reposition\n        formationManager->RealignUnit(unit);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles to dynamically adjust
    movement behavior based on formation requirements. The implementation may consider
    the unit's current position, target location, and formation constraints to make
    decisions.
  warnings: Developers should be cautious when relying on this method in high-frequency
    update contexts as it might involve expensive calculations. Additionally, ensure
    that kiting and formation systems are properly synchronized to avoid inconsistent
    behavior.
