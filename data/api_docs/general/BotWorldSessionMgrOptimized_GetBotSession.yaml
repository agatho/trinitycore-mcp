  class: BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized
  method: GetBotSession
  signature: std::shared_ptr<BotSession> BotWorldSessionMgrOptimized::GetBotSession(int
    playerGuid) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a bot session associated with the specified player GUID.
  description: The GetBotSession method retrieves a shared pointer to a BotSession
    object that corresponds to the given player GUID. This method is used in the context
    of TrinityCore's bot system to manage and access individual bot sessions. The
    returned session can be used to interact with or control the specific bot instance
    associated with the player. The method performs a lookup in an internal data structure
    that maps player GUIDs to their respective bot sessions. If no session exists
    for the provided GUID, the method will return a null shared pointer.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose bot session is to
      be retrieved. This value must correspond to an existing player in the game world.
  returns: A std::shared_ptr<BotSession> pointing to the bot session associated with
    the specified player GUID. Returns a null pointer if no session exists for the
    given GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use a bot session
    code: "std::shared_ptr<BotSession> session = botWorldSessionMgr->GetBotSession(12345);\n\
      if (session)\n{\n    // Use the session to control or query the bot\n    session->DoSomething();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for valid session before usage
    code: "auto session = botWorldSessionMgr->GetBotSession(playerGuid);\nif (session\
      \ && session->IsAlive())\n{\n    // Safe to use the session\n    session->MoveToTarget(target);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid or dead session\n    LogError(\"Invalid or\
      \ inactive bot session\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used within the context of bot AI logic and player
    interaction systems. The internal lookup mechanism may involve hash tables or
    similar data structures for performance optimization. Ensure that the player GUID
    passed to this method corresponds to a valid player in the game world, otherwise
    the returned pointer will be null.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent player GUID will result
    in returning a null shared pointer. Always check for null before using the returned
    session object to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, since this is part of a
    bot management system, ensure thread safety if accessing from multiple threads
    simultaneously.
