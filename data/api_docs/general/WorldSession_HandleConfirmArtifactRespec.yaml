documentation:
  brief: Processes the confirmation of an artifact respec action for a player character.
  description: The HandleConfirmArtifactRespec method handles the client's confirmation
    packet when a player chooses to respec their artifact traits. This method is part
    of the artifact system in World of Warcraft, allowing players to reset their artifact
    power specializations and redistribute their artifact trait points. The method
    validates the player's state, checks if they have sufficient artifact power, and
    applies the respec changes to their character. It ensures that the respec operation
    is only allowed under valid conditions, such as having enough artifact power and
    being in a valid game state. This method directly interacts with the player's
    artifact data and updates their trait points accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: confirmArtifactRespec
    description: The packet containing the artifact respec confirmation data from
      the client, including the artifact GUID and any relevant flags or identifiers.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Artifact Respec Confirmation
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleConfirmArtifactRespec(WorldPackets::Artifact::ConfirmArtifactRespec&\
      \ confirmArtifactRespec)\n{\n    Player* player = GetPlayer();\n    if (!player\
      \ || !player->GetGUID())\n        return;\n\n    // Process the artifact respec\
      \ confirmation\n    player->GetArtifactMgr()->ConfirmRespec(confirmArtifactRespec);\n\
      }"

  notes: This method is typically called when a player clicks 'Confirm' on the artifact
    respec interface. The method assumes that all validation has been performed by
    the client and focuses on applying the changes server-side. It's important to
    note that this operation consumes artifact power, which is a limited resource
    in the game.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method could lead to players gaining unlimited
    artifact power or bypassing respec restrictions. Ensure proper validation and
    state checks before applying any changes to player artifact data. This method
    should only be called when the player has sufficient artifact power and is in
    a valid state for respec operations.
