  class: ReactorAI
  method: UpdateAI
  signature: void ReactorAI::UpdateAI(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the reactor AI behavior based on the elapsed time delta.
  description: The UpdateAI method is responsible for executing the core logic of
    the ReactorAI class, which governs the behavior of certain game objects or creatures
    that react to environmental stimuli or player actions. This method is called periodically
    by the game engine's update loop and receives a time delta (diff) parameter indicating
    how much time has passed since the last execution. It processes reactions, updates
    internal states, and may trigger events or actions based on the current game context
    and conditions. The method typically handles logic such as detecting nearby players,
    responding to damage, or executing scripted behaviors that are part of the reactor's
    programmed response system.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to determine how much time has passed and affects timing-sensitive behaviors
      such as reaction delays, cooldowns, or animation progress.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateAI Call
    code: "void MyCreature::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateAI(diff))\n    \
      \    return;\n    // Custom AI logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: ReactorAI with Reaction Timing
    code: "void ReactorAI::UpdateAI(int diff)\n{\n    if (m_reactTimer <= 0)\n   \
      \ {\n        // Perform reaction logic\n        DoReaction();\n        m_reactTimer\
      \ = REACTION_DELAY;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_reactTimer -= diff;\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the creature's main update loop and
    should not block or perform heavy computations that could affect game performance.
    The 'diff' parameter represents real-time elapsed milliseconds, making it suitable
    for precise timing of AI behaviors.
  warnings: Do not modify the 'diff' parameter directly as it may cause incorrect
    behavior in time-sensitive reactions. Ensure all internal timers are properly
    reset or updated when transitioning between different states.
