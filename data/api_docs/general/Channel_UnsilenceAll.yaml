  class: Channel
  method: UnsilenceAll
  signature: void Channel::UnsilenceAll(const Player * player, const std::string &
    name)
documentation:
  brief: Removes all muted players from a specified channel, allowing them to speak
    again.
  description: The UnsilenceAll method removes all players who have been silenced
    (muted) in a specific channel. This action effectively unmutes all previously
    muted members of the channel, restoring their ability to send messages. The method
    requires a player reference and the name of the channel to operate on. It is typically
    used by channel moderators or administrators when they wish to restore communication
    privileges for all muted users at once. The operation affects only the specified
    channel and does not impact other channels or global chat settings.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object who is requesting the unmute action.
      This player must have appropriate permissions (such as channel moderator status)
      to perform this operation on the specified channel.
  - name: name
    description: The name of the channel from which all muted players will be unmuted.
      This string should match an existing channel name exactly, including case sensitivity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"General\", player);\nif (channel)\n\
      {\n    channel->UnsilenceAll(player, \"General\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Permission Check
    code: "if (player->GetSession()->GetSecurity() >= SEC_MODERATOR)\n{\n    Channel*\
      \ channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"Trade\", player);\n    if (channel &&\
      \ channel->HasFlag(CHANNEL_FLAG_MUTE))\n    {\n        channel->UnsilenceAll(player,\
      \ \"Trade\");\n        player->SendNotification(\"All muted players have been\
      \ unmuted in Trade channel.\");\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the calling player has sufficient permissions to
    manage the channel's mute list. It does not validate whether the channel actually
    exists or if any players are currently muted; it simply clears all mute entries
    for the given channel. The implementation may involve iterating through a list
    of muted users and removing them from the internal mute state.
  warnings: Using this method without proper permission checks can lead to unintended
    access to channel management features. It should only be called by trusted administrators
    or moderators. Additionally, calling this on a non-existent channel will likely
    result in no-op behavior or potential errors depending on implementation details.
