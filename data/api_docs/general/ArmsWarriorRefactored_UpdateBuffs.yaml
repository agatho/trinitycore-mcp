  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void ArmsWarriorRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates all active buff states and applies relevant combat effects for the
    Arms Warrior class.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buffs and debuffs that affect an Arms Warrior character during combat.
    This method ensures that the warrior's current stat modifiers, such as increased
    attack power, critical strike chance, or damage multipliers, are properly applied
    based on their current equipped items, spell effects, and class abilities. It
    typically runs during each update cycle of the game loop to maintain accurate
    state representation of the warrior's combat readiness. The method may also handle
    cooldowns, aura expiration, and the application of temporary combat enhancements
    specific to the Arms specialization.

  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void GameLoop::UpdatePlayerCombat(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->IsArmsWarrior())\n\
      \    {\n        ArmsWarriorRefactored* warrior = static_cast<ArmsWarriorRefactored*>(player);\n\
      \        warrior->UpdateBuffs();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to ensure accurate
    buff state management. It may internally iterate through active auras and apply
    stat modifications, so performance considerations are important for frequent calls.
