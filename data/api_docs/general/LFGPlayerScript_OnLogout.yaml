documentation:
  brief: Handles player logout event for LFG (Looking for Group) functionality
  description: The OnLogout method is invoked when a player logs out of the game,
    specifically designed to manage and clean up LFG (Looking for Group) related data
    and states. This method ensures that any active LFG queues, roles, or group memberships
    are properly handled during the logout process. It typically removes the player
    from LFG queues, clears their LFG state, and may update internal tracking systems
    to reflect the player's offline status. The method is part of the LFGPlayerScript
    class which extends the standard PlayerScript functionality to provide custom
    behavior for LFG-related events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Implementation Example
    code: "class MyLFGScript : public LFGPlayerScript\n{\npublic:\n    MyLFGScript()\
      \ : LFGPlayerScript(\"MyLFGScript\") {}\n    \n    void OnLogout(Player* player)\
      \ override\n    {\n        // Clear LFG data on logout\n        if (player)\n\
      \        {\n            sLFGMgr->ClearPlayerQueue(player->GetGUID());\n    \
      \        // Additional cleanup logic here\n        }\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the player logout sequence, so it should avoid
    heavy operations that might delay the logout process. The Player object passed
    to this method may have limited data available as the player's session is being
    terminated.
  warnings: Do not perform operations that require active network communication or
    database access within this method, as the player session is already in the process
    of being closed. Avoid modifying data structures that might be accessed by other
    threads during logout processing.
