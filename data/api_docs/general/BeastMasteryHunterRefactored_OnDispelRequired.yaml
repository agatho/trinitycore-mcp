  method: OnDispelRequired
  signature: void BeastMasteryHunterRefactored::OnDispelRequired(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the required dispel event for the Beast Mastery hunter ability
  description: The OnDispelRequired method is invoked when a dispel effect is needed
    on the Beast Mastery hunter's pet or summon. This method typically manages the
    cleanup and state transitions of the hunter's beast companion when an external
    dispel mechanic is triggered, ensuring proper synchronization between the pet's
    status and the hunter's active abilities. The method may adjust the pet's duration,
    remove debuffs, or trigger specific visual effects depending on the game context
    and current spell states.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier or index
      for the dispel operation. This value is used to determine which pet or summon
      should be affected by the dispel event.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OnDispelRequired
    code: 'int targetId = 12345;

      beastMasteryHunter->OnDispelRequired(&targetId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when a dispel event is explicitly required
    by the game engine or spell system. It assumes that the target parameter points
    to a valid pet or summon entity within the hunter's control.
  warnings: Improper use of this method with invalid or null target pointers may lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes in the game client. Ensure that the target is
    properly validated before calling this method.
