documentation:
  brief: Determines whether two professions form a beneficial combination in the game.
  description: The IsBeneficialPair method evaluates if two given profession types
    form a beneficial pairing, which is typically used to determine if players can
    gain bonuses or synergies when combining certain professions. This method likely
    checks predefined rules or relationships between professions within the TrinityCore
    framework. The implementation may consider factors such as crafting synergy, resource
    sharing, or gameplay balance mechanics. It's commonly used in systems that manage
    profession interactions, crafting recipes, or player progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the two profession types form a beneficial combination
    according to game rules; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Alchemy and Enchanting are Beneficial Pair
    code: "if (professionManager.IsBeneficialPair(PROFESSION_ALCHEMY, PROFESSION_ENCHANTING))\
      \ {\n    // Apply bonus effects or notify player\n    printf(\"Alchemy and Enchanting\
      \ provide synergistic benefits\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal lookup tables or rule definitions to determine
    beneficial combinations. It's important to note that the actual implementation
    details depend on how TrinityCore defines profession relationships and synergy
    mechanics.
