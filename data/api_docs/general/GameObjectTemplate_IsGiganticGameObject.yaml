documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the game object is classified as a gigantic game object.
  description: The IsGiganticGameObject method checks if the current GameObjectTemplate
    instance represents a gigantic game object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore,
    certain game objects are flagged as 'gigantic' to indicate they have special scaling
    or rendering properties that differ from standard objects. This flag is typically
    used during client-side rendering and collision detection logic to handle these
    large-scale objects appropriately. The method performs a simple boolean check
    against an internal flag set during the object template loading process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the game object is classified as gigantic, false otherwise.
    This indicates whether special handling for large-scale rendering or interaction
    should be applied to this object type.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "GameObjectTemplate* goTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetGameObjectTemplate(12345);\n\
      if (goTemplate && goTemplate->IsGiganticGameObject()) {\n    // Handle gigantic\
      \ game object logic\n    sLog->outString(\"Found a gigantic game object with\
      \ ID: %u\", goTemplate->entry);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Rendering Logic
    code: "void HandleGameObjectSpawn(GameObject* go) {\n    GameObjectTemplate const*\
      \ goInfo = go->GetGOInfo();\n    if (goInfo->IsGiganticGameObject()) {\n   \
      \     // Apply special scaling or rendering for gigantic objects\n        go->SetFloatValue(OBJECT_FIELD_SCALE_X,\
      \ 2.0f);\n        go->SetUInt32Value(GAMEOBJECT_FLAGS, GO_FLAG_GIGANTIC);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal flags that are set during GameObjectTemplate
    initialization from database entries. Developers should be aware that the 'gigantic'
    flag is not automatically populated for all game objects and must be explicitly
    defined in the game object template data.
  warnings: The method assumes that the GameObjectTemplate has been properly initialized
    with valid data from the database. Calling this method on an uninitialized or
    invalid GameObjectTemplate may lead to undefined behavior.
