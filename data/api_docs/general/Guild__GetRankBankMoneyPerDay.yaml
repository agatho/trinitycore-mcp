documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the maximum amount of gold that can be withdrawn from the guild
    bank per day for a specified rank.
  description: This method returns the daily gold withdrawal limit for a given guild
    rank. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore implementation, guilds have different
    ranks with varying permissions and limitations. The guild bank allows members
    to deposit and withdraw gold, but each rank has a specific daily cap on how much
    gold they can withdraw. This function fetches that value for the specified rank
    ID. The returned value represents the maximum amount in copper coins (as is standard
    in WoW's currency system). This method is typically used internally by the guild
    management system to enforce withdrawal limits based on player rank.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum daily gold withdrawal limit for
    the specified rank, expressed in copper coins. Returns 0 if the rank ID is invalid
    or no limit is set for that rank.
  examples:
  - title: Get Daily Withdrawal Limit for Guild Master Rank
    code: 'uint32 maxWithdrawal = guild->_GetRankBankMoneyPerDay(GUILD_RANK_GUILD_MASTER);

      // Returns the maximum daily gold withdrawal amount for the guild master rank
      (typically 0, meaning no limit)'
    language: cpp
  - title: Check Withdrawal Limit for a Regular Member Rank
    code: "uint32 limit = guild->_GetRankBankMoneyPerDay(GUILD_RANK_MEMBER);\nif (limit\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    printf(\"Regular members can withdraw up to %u copper per day.\\\
      n\", limit);\n}\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No daily withdrawal limit for this rank.\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal guild bank system and likely called during
    transactions to validate whether a player's withdrawal request exceeds their rank's
    daily limit. It does not perform any validation on the input parameter, so calling
    with an invalid rank ID may return unexpected results or zero. The actual implementation
    depends on the guild rank configuration stored in the database.
  warnings: Do not assume that all ranks have a non-zero limit; some ranks (like Guild
    Master) may have unlimited withdrawals. Calling this method without proper validation
    of the rank ID can lead to incorrect behavior if an invalid ID is passed.
