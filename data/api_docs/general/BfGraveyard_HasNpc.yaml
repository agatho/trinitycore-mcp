  class: BfGraveyard
  method: HasNpc
  signature: bool BfGraveyard::HasNpc(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific NPC exists within the graveyard.
  description: The HasNpc method determines whether a particular NPC with the specified
    GUID is currently present in the graveyard. This functionality is crucial for
    battlefield systems where NPCs are dynamically spawned and removed based on control
    states and objectives. The method typically performs a lookup within the graveyard's
    internal NPC tracking system to verify existence.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the NPC to check for existence in
      the graveyard.
  returns: Returns true if an NPC with the specified GUID is currently present in
    the graveyard, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if a specific NPC exists in the graveyard
    code: "if (graveyard->HasNpc(12345)) {\n    // NPC with GUID 12345 is present\n\
      \    printf(\"NPC found in graveyard\\n\");\n} else {\n    // NPC with GUID\
      \ 12345 is not present\n    printf(\"NPC not found in graveyard\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses an internal data structure such as a map or set to
    efficiently track active NPCs. It may be called frequently during battlefield
    updates, so performance is important for large-scale deployments.
