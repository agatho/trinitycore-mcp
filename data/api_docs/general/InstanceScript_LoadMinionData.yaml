  class: InstanceScript
  method: LoadMinionData
  signature: void InstanceScript::LoadMinionData(const MinionData * data)
documentation:
  brief: Loads minion data for an instance script, initializing tracked minions and
    their associated GUIDs.
  description: The LoadMinionData method is used to initialize and register minion
    data within an InstanceScript. This method typically takes a pointer to an array
    of MinionData structures which contain information about minions that should be
    tracked by the instance script. It's commonly used in dungeon and raid encounters
    where specific NPCs (minions) need to be monitored for events such as death, respawn,
    or other state changes. The method iterates through the provided data and registers
    each minion with the instance script, allowing the script to track their status
    and respond accordingly during the encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Pointer to an array of MinionData structures containing information
      about minions to be tracked by the instance script. Each structure typically
      includes a creature entry ID and a GUID for the minion.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in a dungeon encounter
    code: "class BossInstanceScript : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    BossInstanceScript(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n\n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n \
      \       // Load minion data for boss encounter\n        LoadMinionData(minionData);\n\
      \    }\n\nprivate:\n    static const MinionData minionData[] =\n    {\n    \
      \    {12345, 67890},  // creature entry, guid\n        {12346, 67891},\n   \
      \     {12347, 67892}\n    };\n};"

  notes: This method is typically called during the initialization phase of an instance
    script. It's important to ensure that the MinionData array passed to this method
    remains valid for the lifetime of the instance script, as it's not copied internally.
    The method assumes that all GUIDs in the data are valid and unique within the
    context of the instance.
  warnings: Do not call this method with a null pointer for the data parameter, as
    it will likely cause a crash or undefined behavior. Also, ensure that MinionData
    structures contain valid creature entries and GUIDs to prevent runtime errors
    during minion tracking operations.
