documentation:
  brief: Queues a packet for transmission to the client
  description: The QueuePacket method in BotSession is responsible for adding a network
    packet to the outgoing packet queue for a specific bot session. This method prepares
    packets for delivery to the connected client, typically used during bot behavior
    execution or when sending game state updates. The packet parameter represents
    a raw network packet buffer that will be queued for transmission. This method
    is part of the TrinityCore's bot system architecture and handles packet queuing
    without immediate transmission, deferring to the session's send mechanism.
  parameters:
  - name: packet
    description: Pointer to an integer array representing the raw network packet data
      to be queued for transmission. The packet should contain properly formatted
      network protocol data suitable for the client connection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic packet queuing
    code: 'int packetData[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04};

      botSession->QueuePacket(packetData);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Queuing a prepared packet buffer
    code: 'uint8 packetBuffer[1024];

      // ... populate packetBuffer with network data ...

      botSession->QueuePacket(reinterpret_cast<int*>(packetBuffer));'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not immediately send the packet; it only queues it for later
    transmission. The actual sending occurs through the session's send mechanism.
    Developers should ensure that the packet data pointed to by 'packet' remains valid
    until the packet is actually sent. This method is typically used internally by
    bot behavior systems.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or null pointer to the packet parameter may cause undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the packet data is properly formatted according
    to the client's expected protocol structure before queuing.
