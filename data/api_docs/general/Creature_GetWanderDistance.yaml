  class: Creature
  method: GetWanderDistance
  signature: float Creature::GetWanderDistance() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the wander distance of the creature, determining how far it can move
    from its initial position.
  description: The GetWanderDistance method retrieves the maximum distance a creature
    can wander from its original spawn position. This value is crucial for defining
    the movement range of NPCs during AI behavior, particularly for creatures that
    are set to wander or roam within a specific area. The method returns a float value
    representing this distance in yards, which directly influences how far the creature
    will move from its initial location during pathfinding and wandering behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the wander distance in yards. This value
    indicates how far the creature can move from its spawn position before returning
    to its original location.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "float wanderDistance = creature->GetWanderDistance();\nif (wanderDistance\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Use the distance for pathfinding\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other AI-related methods
    to determine creature behavior. The value returned is usually set during creature
    initialization or through database configuration, and it affects how far a creature
    can wander from its spawn point.
  warnings: The value returned by this method should be interpreted carefully as it
    directly impacts the creature's movement behavior. If set too low, the creature
    may not wander far enough; if set too high, it could potentially move outside
    of intended boundaries.
