documentation:
  brief: Initializes role definitions for the TrinityCore server instance
  description: The Initialize method sets up and configures the role-based access
    control system within TrinityCore. This method is typically called during server
    startup to load and validate role definitions, permissions, and access levels
    for different user groups. It ensures that all role-related systems are properly
    initialized before the server begins processing player requests or administrative
    commands. The initialization process may involve loading configuration files,
    validating role hierarchies, and preparing internal data structures for fast lookup
    of role-based permissions.

  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: RoleDefinitions::Initialize();
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization. Repeated
    calls may result in undefined behavior or resource leaks. The method is typically
    invoked by the core server initialization sequence before any player connections
    are accepted.
  warnings: Calling this method after the server has started processing requests may
    cause race conditions or inconsistent permission states. Ensure all configuration
    files are properly formatted and accessible before calling this method.
