  method: IsInCriticalState
  signature: bool BotPriorityManager::IsInCriticalState(Player * bot) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot is in a critical state requiring immediate attention
    or intervention.
  description: The IsInCriticalState method evaluates the current condition of a specified
    bot player to determine if it has reached a critical threshold that necessitates
    urgent action. This typically involves checking for low health, mana, or other
    vital attributes that could lead to the bot's incapacitation or inability to perform
    its assigned tasks effectively. The method is used by the AI system to prioritize
    bot management and resource allocation. It returns true when the bot's state meets
    predefined critical conditions, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose critical
      state is being evaluated. Must not be null.
  returns: True if the bot is in a critical state requiring immediate attention, false
    otherwise. A critical state may include low health, mana, or other vital parameters
    falling below predetermined thresholds.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if bot needs rescue
    code: "if (botPriorityManager->IsInCriticalState(playerBot)) {\n    // Initiate\
      \ emergency response protocol\n    botAI->EmergencyRescue();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using in a loop to monitor multiple bots
    code: "for (auto& bot : botList) {\n    if (botPriorityManager->IsInCriticalState(bot))\
      \ {\n        LOG_INFO(\"ai.bot\", \"Bot {} is in critical state!\", bot->GetName());\n\
      \        // Trigger priority handling\n        HandleCriticalBot(bot);\n   \
      \ }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs multiple checks on the bot's current status including
    health percentage, mana levels, and possibly combat state. The exact thresholds
    for what constitutes a 'critical' state are implementation-specific and may vary
    based on bot type or mission context.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed to this method is valid and not
    null, as dereferencing an invalid pointer will cause undefined behavior. This
    method should only be called during active bot gameplay scenarios where the bot's
    status is relevant.
