  class: Group
  method: SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID
  signature: void Group::SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID(int difficulty)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the legacy raid difficulty ID for the group.
  description: This method assigns a specific legacy raid difficulty identifier to
    the group, which determines the default difficulty level for instance encounters.
    The difficulty ID corresponds to predefined values used in World of Warcraft's
    legacy raid systems. This setting affects how instances are configured for group
    members and is typically used when managing raid content compatibility or when
    transitioning groups between different difficulty modes. The method does not validate
    the input difficulty value, so callers should ensure the provided value is a valid
    legacy raid difficulty ID.
  parameters:
  - name: difficulty
    description: The legacy raid difficulty ID to set for the group. Valid values
      typically correspond to standard WoW raid difficulties such as 10-player normal
      (0), 25-player normal (1), 10-player heroic (2), and 25-player heroic (3).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Group to 25-Man Normal Difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID(1);\
      \ // 25-player normal\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Group Difficulty Based on Player Role
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group && player->GetRole() == PLAYER_ROLE_TANK)\n\
      {\n    group->SetLegacyRaidDifficultyID(3); // 25-player heroic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal group state and may affect instance entry behavior.
    It is recommended to call this before entering a raid instance to ensure proper
    difficulty settings are applied. The method does not trigger any UI updates or
    notifications to players.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid difficulty ID may result in unexpected
    behavior when entering instances. Ensure that the difficulty value corresponds
    to valid legacy raid difficulties used by the game client.
