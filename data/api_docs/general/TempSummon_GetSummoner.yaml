  signature: int * TempSummon::GetSummoner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns a pointer to the summoner's unique identifier (GUID) for this temporary
    summon.
  description: The GetSummoner method retrieves a pointer to the unique identifier
    (GUID) of the creature or player that summoned this TempSummon instance. In World
    of Warcraft's TrinityCore framework, summons are often created by players or creatures
    and maintain a reference back to their summoner. This method allows access to
    that reference, which can be used for various game logic purposes such as tracking
    ownership, determining faction relationships, or managing summon-specific behavior.
    The returned pointer is typically valid only during the lifetime of the summon
    and should not be dereferenced beyond the summon's active state.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an integer representing the GUID of the summoner. Returns
    nullptr if no summoner exists or if the summon has been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check summoner existence
    code: "if (TempSummon* summon = dynamic_cast<TempSummon*>(unit)) {\n    int* summonerGuid\
      \ = summon->GetSummoner();\n    if (summonerGuid != nullptr) {\n        // Summoner\
      \ exists, use *summonerGuid to get the actual GUID\n        uint32 summonerId\
      \ = *summonerGuid;\n        // Perform actions based on summoner ID\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using summoner GUID for faction checks
    code: "TempSummon* summon = ...; // obtained from some summon logic\nint* summonerGuid\
      \ = summon->GetSummoner();\nif (summonerGuid != nullptr) {\n    uint32 guid\
      \ = *summonerGuid;\n    if (Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(guid)))\
      \ {\n        // Check if the summoner is friendly or hostile\n        if (player->IsFriendlyTo(summon))\
      \ {\n            // Handle friendly summon logic\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned pointer may be null if the summon was created without a valid
    summoner, or if the summoner has been destroyed. The value pointed to should not
    be modified directly as it represents an internal GUID managed by the game engine.
    This method is commonly used in AI behavior scripts and summon management systems.
  warnings: Do not dereference the returned pointer beyond the lifetime of the TempSummon
    object, as this may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify that
    the returned pointer is not null before attempting to access its value.
