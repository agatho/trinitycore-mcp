documentation:
  brief: Checks if an item is locked and cannot be used or modified.
  description: The IsLocked method determines whether an item has been locked, typically
    through a lock or key, preventing it from being used or modified by players. This
    method is commonly used in World of Warcraft to check the lock status of items
    such as keys, locks, or other items that require specific conditions to be unlocked.
    The method returns true if the item is locked and false if it is not locked. This
    functionality is crucial for game mechanics involving key-based locks, item usage
    restrictions, and player interaction with locked objects.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is locked, false otherwise. A locked item cannot
    be used or modified by players until it is unlocked through appropriate means
    such as key usage or lock removal.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\nif (item && item->IsLocked())\
      \ {\n    // Item is locked, cannot be used\n}\nelse {\n    // Item is not locked,\
      \ can be used\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal lock flags or
    state in the item''s data structure. Performance considerations: The method involves
    simple boolean checks and does not require complex operations or database queries.
    Thread safety: Since this is a const method, it does not modify any data and is
    thread-safe.'
  warnings: 'This method should be used carefully when checking item lock status,
    as incorrect assumptions about lock status may lead to game mechanics issues.
    Common mistake: Assuming that locked items are always unlocked by default, which
    is not true in all cases.'
