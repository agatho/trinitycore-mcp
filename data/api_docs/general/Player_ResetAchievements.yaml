  brief: Resets all achievements for the player, clearing progress and rewards
  description: The ResetAchievements method clears all achievement progress and rewards
    for the player, resetting their achievement data to its initial state. This method
    is typically used during character resets or when implementing game mechanics
    that require resetting achievement progress. It removes all completed achievements
    and resets the achievement system to allow players to start fresh with new achievements.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method affects the entire achievement system and should be used carefully
    during character resets or when implementing game mechanics. The method is typically
    called internally by TrinityCore's achievement system and may not be directly
    accessible to regular players.
