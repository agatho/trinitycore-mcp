  class: ArcaneMageRefactored
  method: ExecuteAoERotation
  signature: void ArcaneMageRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int * target, uint32 enemyCount)
documentation:
  brief: Executes the arcane mage's AoE rotation strategy based on enemy count and
    target selection.
  description: The ExecuteAoERotation method implements the core logic for an arcane
    mage's area-of-effect spell casting routine. It evaluates the current combat situation,
    including the number of enemies present and the selected target, to determine
    the optimal sequence of spells to cast. This method typically prioritizes high-damage
    AoE abilities such as Arcane Explosion or Blizzard while considering mana efficiency
    and cooldowns. The implementation may adjust spell priorities based on enemy density
    and player resource levels.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target entity for spell targeting. Should point to
      a valid GameObject or Unit object representing the primary enemy in the AoE
      area.
  - name: enemyCount
    description: Integer value indicating the number of enemies within the AoE casting
      range. Used to determine spell selection and rotation priority.
  returns: null

  - title: Basic AoE Rotation Execution
    code: "void ArcaneMageRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int* target, uint32 enemyCount)\n\
      {\n    if (enemyCount >= 3)\n        CastSpell(ArcaneExplosion);\n    else if\
      \ (enemyCount >= 2)\n        CastSpell(Blizzard);\n    else\n        CastSpell(ArcaneBlast);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced AoE Rotation with Resource Management
    code: "void ArcaneMageRefactored::ExecuteAoERotation(int* target, uint32 enemyCount)\n\
      {\n    if (GetManaPercentage() < 20)\n        return;\n    \n    if (enemyCount\
      \ >= 5 && IsSpellReady(StarFire))\n        CastSpell(StarFire);\n    else if\
      \ (enemyCount >= 3)\n        CastSpell(ArcaneExplosion);\n    else if (enemyCount\
      \ >= 2)\n        CastSpell(Blizzard);\n    else\n        CastSpell(ArcaneBlast);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the target parameter points to a valid entity and
    that enemyCount is accurately calculated. The rotation logic may be extended with
    additional conditions such as debuff presence, player buffs, or environmental
    factors in more complex implementations.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is not null before dereferencing it. The
    method does not handle cases where enemyCount might be zero or negative, which
    could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly validated by calling code.
