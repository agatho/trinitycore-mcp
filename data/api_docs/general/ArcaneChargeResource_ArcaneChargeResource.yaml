documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the ArcaneChargeResource class with default
    values.
  description: The ArcaneChargeResource constructor initializes a new instance of
    the ArcaneChargeResource class. This method sets up the internal state of the
    arcane charge resource, typically configuring default values for arcane charge
    levels, cooldowns, or related game mechanics. In the context of World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore framework, this constructor is likely used to prepare an arcane charge
    resource object that can be managed by the player's spell system or aura effects.
    The initialization process ensures that all member variables are properly set
    to their initial states before being used in gameplay logic.

  - title: Creating a new ArcaneChargeResource instance
    code: 'ArcaneChargeResource arcaneResource;

      // The arcaneResource object is now initialized with default values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called automatically when creating a new ArcaneChargeResource
    object. Developers should be aware that the default initialization may not represent
    a fully functional resource state, and additional setup might be required before
    using it in gameplay scenarios.
