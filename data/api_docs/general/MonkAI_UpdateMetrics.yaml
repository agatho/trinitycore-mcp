documentation:
  brief: Updates the Monk AI metrics based on the time difference since last update.
  description: The UpdateMetrics method is responsible for recalculating and refreshing
    various performance and behavior-related metrics within the MonkAI class. It typically
    processes time-based changes, such as cooldowns, energy regeneration, or combat
    statistics, using the provided time delta (diff) to ensure accurate state updates.
    This method is commonly called during the AI update cycle in TrinityCore's game
    loop to maintain synchronization between the AI logic and the current game state.
    The method does not require any specific preconditions but assumes that the AI
    instance has been properly initialized.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ...\n    if (monkAI)\n        monkAI->UpdateMetrics(diff);\n\
      \    // ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from within the main AI update loop and
    should be called regularly to ensure that all metrics remain synchronized with
    real-time game events. The 'diff' parameter represents milliseconds since last
    update, which is standard in TrinityCore's time management system.
