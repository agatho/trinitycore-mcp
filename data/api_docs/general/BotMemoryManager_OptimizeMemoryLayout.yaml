documentation:
  brief: Reorganizes and optimizes the memory layout of bot data structures for improved
    performance and reduced memory fragmentation.
  description: The OptimizeMemoryLayout method is designed to restructure and rearrange
    the internal memory allocation of bot-related data within the BotMemoryManager
    class. This method aims to reduce memory fragmentation, improve cache locality,
    and optimize overall memory usage patterns for bot instances. It typically involves
    compacting allocated memory blocks, reallocating data structures, and potentially
    rebuilding internal indexes or lookup tables to ensure efficient memory access
    patterns. The operation is usually performed during idle periods or when significant
    changes occur in the bot population to maintain optimal performance without impacting
    active gameplay.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'BotMemoryManager* memoryManager = BotMemoryManager::Instance();

      memoryManager->OptimizeMemoryLayout();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called sparingly as it may cause temporary performance
    degradation during execution. It's recommended to schedule this operation during
    low-activity periods or server maintenance windows. The optimization process might
    involve locking internal data structures, so concurrent access to bot memory operations
    should be avoided during execution.
  warnings: Calling this method while bots are actively processing AI decisions or
    performing actions may lead to inconsistent behavior or temporary unresponsiveness
    of those bots. Ensure that no active bot operations are occurring before invoking
    this optimization routine.
