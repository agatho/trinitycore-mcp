  method: CanSpawnInZone
  signature: bool BotSpawnerAdapter::CanSpawnInZone(uint32 zoneId) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot can be spawned in the specified zone based on zone
    restrictions and configuration settings.
  description: The CanSpawnInZone method evaluates if it is permissible to spawn a
    bot within a given zone. This check typically considers various factors such as
    zone type (e.g., battlegrounds, sanctuaries, or normal zones), player count limits,
    and server-side configurations that may restrict bot spawning in certain areas.
    The method returns true if the zone allows bot spawning, and false otherwise.
    It is commonly used during bot initialization or spawn requests to ensure compliance
    with game rules and server settings.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified zone permits bot spawning; otherwise, returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (botSpawner->CanSpawnInZone(1234)) {\n    // Proceed with bot spawn\
      \ logic\n    botSpawner->SpawnBot();\n} else {\n    // Zone does not allow spawning\n\
      \    sLog->outString(\"Cannot spawn bot in zone 1234\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs a lookup against internal zone data structures
    or configuration tables. It may be called frequently during bot management operations,
    so performance is important. The implementation might cache results for efficiency.
