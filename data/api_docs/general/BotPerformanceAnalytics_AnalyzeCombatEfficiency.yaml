  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: AnalyzeCombatEfficiency
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::AnalyzeCombatEfficiency(uint32_t botGuid,
    BotPerformanceProfile & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes and records combat efficiency metrics for a specified bot character.
  description: The AnalyzeCombatEfficiency method evaluates the performance of a bot
    character during combat encounters, collecting data such as damage dealt, healing
    done, resource usage, and overall effectiveness. This method is typically invoked
    at the end of a combat session or when a bot's performance needs to be assessed
    for optimization purposes. It updates the provided BotPerformanceProfile with
    detailed metrics that can be used for tuning bot behavior, identifying performance
    bottlenecks, or generating reports on bot effectiveness in various combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot character whose combat efficiency
      is to be analyzed. This value must correspond to a valid bot entry in the game
      world.
  - name: profile
    description: A reference to a BotPerformanceProfile object that will be updated
      with combat efficiency metrics. The profile stores historical performance data
      and is modified in-place by this method.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      BotPerformanceProfile profile;

      botAnalytics.AnalyzeCombatEfficiency(botGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Performance Logging
    code: "uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();\nBotPerformanceProfile\
      \ profile;\nbotAnalytics.AnalyzeCombatEfficiency(botGuid, profile);\n// Log\
      \ performance metrics\nTC_LOG_INFO(\"bot\", \"Bot %u combat efficiency: DPS=%f,\
      \ HPS=%f\", \n    botGuid, profile.GetAverageDPS(), profile.GetAverageHPS());"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot has completed a combat session and that
    relevant combat data is available in memory. It may perform calculations based
    on accumulated combat events, so calling this method before combat ends may result
    in incomplete or inaccurate metrics.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided botGuid corresponds to an active bot; otherwise,
    the method may fail silently or produce undefined behavior. The BotPerformanceProfile
    object should be initialized before passing it to this method to avoid potential
    memory issues.
