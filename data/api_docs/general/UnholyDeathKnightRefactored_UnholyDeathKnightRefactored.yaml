  class: UnholyDeathKnightRefactored
  method: UnholyDeathKnightRefactored
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::UnholyDeathKnightRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new Unholy Death Knight AI bot with the specified player.
  description: The UnholyDeathKnightRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the UnholyDeathKnightRefactored AI class, setting up internal state and configurations
    for a player acting as an Unholy Death Knight in the TrinityCore environment.
    This method prepares the bot's behavior patterns, spell usage, and combat strategies
    specific to the Unholy Death Knight specialization. The constructor ensures that
    all necessary data structures are properly allocated and initialized before the
    AI begins controlling the player character.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be controlled
      by this AI instance. Must not be null and should represent a valid Death Knight
      character with Unholy specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myDeathKnight = ...; // Get or create a Death Knight player

      UnholyDeathKnightRefactored unholyAI(myDeathKnight);

      // The AI is now ready to control the Death Knight'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per bot instance. It performs
    initialization of AI-specific data structures and may allocate memory for spell
    tracking, cooldown management, and behavior state machines.
