  class: DestructionImmolateTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void DestructionImmolateTracker::Update()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the destruction immolate tracker state, processing ongoing immolation
    effects and managing their duration.
  description: The Update method is responsible for maintaining and processing the
    state of immolation effects applied to targets within the Destruction class. This
    method typically iterates through active immolation spells, checks their remaining
    duration, applies damage ticks if necessary, and cleans up expired effects. It
    ensures that destruction-based immolation abilities behave correctly according
    to game mechanics, including proper tick timing, damage application, and effect
    removal. The method is usually called during the AI update cycle or spell tick
    processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void DestructionImmolateTracker::Update()\n{\n    // Process all active\
      \ immolation effects\n    for (auto& effect : m_activeImmolateEffects)\n   \
      \ {\n        if (effect->IsExpired())\n            RemoveEffect(effect);\n \
      \       else\n            ApplyTickDamage(effect);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked from the AI update loop or spell tick handler.
    It's important to ensure that the tracker maintains a consistent list of active
    effects and properly handles concurrent access if used in multithreaded contexts.
  warnings: Improper handling of effect durations or damage application can lead to
    incorrect gameplay behavior, including over-damage or missing damage ticks. Ensure
    all immolation effects are properly initialized before calling Update.
