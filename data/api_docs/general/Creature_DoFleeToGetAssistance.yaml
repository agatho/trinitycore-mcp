  brief: Makes the creature flee to get assistance from nearby allies when it is attacked.
  description: This method triggers the creature to flee to a nearby ally for assistance
    when it is attacked, typically used in AI behavior to simulate fleeing from combat.
    The creature will move toward the nearest friendly unit and attempt to get assistance
    from them, usually resulting in the ally engaging the attacker as well. This method
    is commonly used in creature AI scripts to implement defensive behavior and can
    be triggered by various combat situations.

    code: "void Creature::DoFleeToGetAssistance() {\n    // Implementation in TrinityCore\n\
      }\n\n// Usage in AI script:\nvoid Creature::AI() {\n    if (health < 20) {\n\
      \        DoFleeToGetAssistance();\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the creature's AI behavior and should be used in conjunction
    with other AI methods to create realistic combat behavior. It typically requires
    the creature to have nearby allies that can provide assistance.
  warnings: The method may not work properly if there are no nearby friendly units
    available for assistance, or if the creature is already in combat with multiple
    attackers.
