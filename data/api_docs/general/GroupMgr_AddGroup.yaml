  method: AddGroup
  signature: void GroupMgr::AddGroup(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a group to the group manager's internal collection of active groups.
  description: The AddGroup method is responsible for registering a new Group object
    within the GroupMgr singleton instance. This method ensures that the group is
    properly tracked and managed by the server's group system, allowing for proper
    synchronization of group members, loot settings, and other group-related functionality.
    The group must be fully initialized before being added, as this method does not
    perform any validation or initialization of the group object itself. Once added,
    the group will be included in various group operations such as updates, broadcasts,
    and cleanup routines.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a newly created group to the manager
    code: 'Group* newGroup = new Group();

      // Initialize the group with members...

      groupMgr->AddGroup(newGroup);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the Group constructor or when
    a new group is formed. It's important to ensure that the Group object passed to
    this method remains valid for the duration of its use in the manager, as no copy
    or deep clone is performed. The GroupMgr maintains a collection of all active
    groups, which can be accessed through other methods like GetGroupById().
  warnings: Calling AddGroup with a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior
    or crashes. Always ensure that the Group object is properly allocated and initialized
    before calling this method. Additionally, adding the same group instance multiple
    times may lead to unexpected behavior as the manager does not perform duplicate
    checks.
