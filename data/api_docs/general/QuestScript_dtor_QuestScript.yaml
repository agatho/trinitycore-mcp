  signature: void QuestScript::~QuestScript()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a QuestScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The QuestScript destructor is automatically invoked when a QuestScript
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. This method ensures proper
    cleanup of any dynamically allocated memory, registered callbacks, or internal
    data structures associated with the quest script. In the context of TrinityCore's
    scripting system, this destructor plays a crucial role in preventing memory leaks
    and maintaining stable server performance during quest lifecycle management. The
    destruction process typically involves unregistering the script from event handlers,
    releasing references to quest-related objects, and freeing any allocated resources
    that were initialized during the script's lifetime.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic Destruction
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    QuestScript* script = new QuestScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Triggers ~QuestScript()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Stack Allocation Destruction
    code: "void AnotherFunction()\n{\n    QuestScript script; // Constructor called\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    // ~QuestScript() automatically called when\
      \ going out of scope\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is typically called by the C++ runtime system and should not
    be invoked manually unless explicitly managing object lifetime. TrinityCore's
    quest scripting system relies on proper destruction to maintain memory integrity,
    especially in long-running server environments where quest scripts may be dynamically
    loaded and unloaded.
  warnings: Manual invocation of the destructor can lead to undefined behavior if
    the object has already been destroyed or if it's part of a larger object hierarchy.
    Avoid calling ~QuestScript() directly unless you're certain about the object's
    state and lifecycle management.
