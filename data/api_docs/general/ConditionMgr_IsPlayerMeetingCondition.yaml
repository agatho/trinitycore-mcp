  class: ConditionMgr
  method: IsPlayerMeetingCondition
  signature: bool ConditionMgr::IsPlayerMeetingCondition(const Player * player, const
    PlayerConditionEntry * condition)
documentation:
  brief: Evaluates whether a player meets the specified condition requirements.
  description: The IsPlayerMeetingCondition method checks if a given player satisfies
    all the conditions defined in a PlayerConditionEntry. This function is typically
    used within the TrinityCore framework to validate player eligibility for quests,
    spells, items, or other game mechanics that require specific criteria to be met.
    It evaluates various aspects such as player level, faction, quest status, item
    ownership, and other conditional flags defined in the condition entry. The method
    returns true if all conditions are satisfied by the player, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that is being evaluated against the
      condition. Must not be null.
  - name: condition
    description: A pointer to the PlayerConditionEntry that defines the set of conditions
      to be checked. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player meets all the conditions specified in the PlayerConditionEntry,
    false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->IsPlayerMeetingCondition(player, conditionEntry)) {\n\
      \    // Player meets the condition\n    player->SendNotification(\"You meet\
      \ the required conditions.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Quest Eligibility Check
    code: "PlayerConditionEntry const* questCondition = sConditionMgr->GetCondition(PLAYER_CONDITION_QUEST_AVAILABLE,\
      \ questId);\nif (questCondition && sConditionMgr->IsPlayerMeetingCondition(player,\
      \ questCondition)) {\n    // Player can accept the quest\n    player->CompleteQuest(questId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a comprehensive evaluation of all condition types defined
    in the PlayerConditionEntry. It may involve database lookups or complex logic
    depending on the condition flags set. The method is designed to be efficient and
    cacheable where possible, but repeated calls with different conditions should
    be considered carefully for performance impact.
  warnings: Ensure that both player and condition parameters are valid pointers before
    calling this method. Passing null pointers will result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. Be aware that some conditions may depend on dynamic state such as quest
    progress or item possession, which could change during execution.
