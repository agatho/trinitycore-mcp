  class: PathfindingManager
  method: GetFallDamageRisk
  signature: float PathfindingManager::GetFallDamageRisk(const int & from, const int
    & to)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the risk of fall damage between two points in the game world.
  description: The GetFallDamageRisk method evaluates the potential for fall damage
    when moving from one point to another within the game environment. It takes into
    account the height difference between the source and destination points, as well
    as any relevant environmental factors that might influence the severity of fall
    damage. This method is typically used by pathfinding algorithms to assess the
    safety of different movement paths and avoid routes that could result in excessive
    damage to the player or creature. The returned value represents a normalized risk
    factor, where higher values indicate a greater likelihood of significant fall
    damage.
  parameters:
  - name: from
    description: The starting point identifier (typically a node or waypoint index)
      from which the movement begins
  - name: to
    description: The destination point identifier (typically a node or waypoint index)
      to which the movement leads
  returns: A float value representing the fall damage risk between the two points.
    Values typically range from 0.0 (no risk) to 1.0 (maximum risk), though exact
    ranges may vary based on game mechanics and implementation details.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in pathfinding
    code: "float risk = pathfinder->GetFallDamageRisk(5, 10);\nif (risk > 0.7f) {\n\
      \    // Avoid this path due to high fall damage risk\n    continue;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integrating with path selection logic
    code: "float currentRisk = pathfinder->GetFallDamageRisk(currentNode, nextNode);\n\
      if (currentRisk < 0.3f) {\n    // Safe to proceed\n    return true;\n} else\
      \ if (currentRisk < 0.6f) {\n    // Moderate risk, consider alternative paths\n\
      \    return false;\n} else {\n    // High risk, avoid this route\n    return\
      \ false;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger pathfinding system that considers
    multiple factors including terrain, height changes, and environmental hazards.
    The exact calculation methodology may depend on the specific implementation details
    of the TrinityCore project's navigation mesh and physics engine.
  warnings: The method assumes valid node indices are provided; invalid indices could
    lead to undefined behavior or incorrect risk calculations. Developers should ensure
    that the from and to parameters correspond to actual navigable points in the pathfinding
    graph.
