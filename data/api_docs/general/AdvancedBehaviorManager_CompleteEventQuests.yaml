  class: AdvancedBehaviorManager
  method: CompleteEventQuests
  signature: void AdvancedBehaviorManager::CompleteEventQuests(WorldEventType type)
documentation:
  brief: Completes all active event quests of the specified world event type for the
    current player.
  description: The CompleteEventQuests method is responsible for finalizing all ongoing
    quest objectives that are associated with a specific world event type. This function
    iterates through the player's active quests, identifies those linked to the given
    WorldEventType, and marks them as completed. It ensures that quest rewards are
    properly distributed and any related event conditions are satisfied. The method
    operates within the context of TrinityCore's advanced behavior management system,
    which handles complex quest and event interactions during world events such as
    holidays or seasonal activities.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The WorldEventType enum value that specifies which category of world
      events should have their associated quests completed. This parameter determines
      the scope of quests to be processed and finalized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Complete All Holiday Quests
    code: 'AdvancedBehaviorManager behaviorManager;

      behaviorManager.CompleteEventQuests(WORLD_EVENT_HOLIDAY);

      // This will complete all active holiday-related quests for the player.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Complete Specific Event Type Quests
    code: "AdvancedBehaviorManager* manager = player->GetAdvancedBehaviorManager();\n\
      if (manager)\n{\n    manager->CompleteEventQuests(WORLD_EVENT_BREWFEST);\n}\n\
      // Completes all Brewfest-related quests for the player if they exist."
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the player is in a valid state to
    receive quest completions. The implementation internally checks for quest validity
    and ensures that rewards are properly handled. It's designed to be thread-safe
    within the context of player session management.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper validation may result in unexpected
    behavior or quest state corruption. Ensure that the WorldEventType parameter is
    valid and corresponds to an actual event type defined in the game world. Avoid
    calling this during critical quest progression sequences where immediate feedback
    is required.
