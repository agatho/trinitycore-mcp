  signature: bool SpawnMetadata::TypeInMask(SpawnObjectType type, SpawnObjectTypeMask
    mask)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a spawn object type is included in the specified spawn object type
    mask.
  description: The TypeInMask method determines whether a given SpawnObjectType is
    present within a SpawnObjectTypeMask. This utility function is commonly used in
    TrinityCore's spawn management systems to filter and categorize different types
    of game objects such as creatures, gameobjects, or dynobjects based on their type.
    It performs a bitwise operation to evaluate membership in the mask, making it
    efficient for runtime checks during object spawning or despawning logic. The method
    assumes valid input parameters and does not perform any validation internally.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The SpawnObjectType to check against the mask. This represents a
      specific type of spawnable object such as SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE, SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT,
      etc.
  - name: mask
    description: The SpawnObjectTypeMask that contains one or more SpawnObjectTypes.
      This is typically a bitmask representing allowed or relevant spawn types for
      filtering purposes.
  returns: Returns true if the specified SpawnObjectType is included in the SpawnObjectTypeMask;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SpawnMetadata metadata;

      SpawnObjectType type = SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE;

      SpawnObjectTypeMask mask = SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE | SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT;

      bool result = metadata.TypeInMask(type, mask);

      // result will be true since SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE is in the mask'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple Types
    code: 'SpawnMetadata metadata;

      SpawnObjectType type = SPAWN_TYPE_DYNOBJECT;

      SpawnObjectTypeMask mask = SPAWN_TYPE_CREATURE | SPAWN_TYPE_GAMEOBJECT;

      bool result = metadata.TypeInMask(type, mask);

      // result will be false since SPAWN_TYPE_DYNOBJECT is not in the mask'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on bitwise operations for performance. It assumes that
    both parameters are valid and properly initialized. The underlying implementation
    likely uses standard bitwise AND operations to determine if a specific type is
    set within the mask.
