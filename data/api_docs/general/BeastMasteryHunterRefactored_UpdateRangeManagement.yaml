documentation:
  brief: Updates the range management for beast mastery hunter abilities and pet behavior.
  description: The UpdateRangeManagement method is responsible for recalculating and
    adjusting the effective range of beast mastery hunter abilities, including pet
    attack ranges, spell casting distances, and interaction zones with targets. This
    method ensures that all pet-related actions are within valid game mechanics constraints
    based on current player state, pet status, and environmental factors. It typically
    runs during combat updates or when pet positioning changes to maintain optimal
    gameplay balance and prevent range-based exploits. The method may also handle
    adjustments for different hunter specializations such as Beast Mastery, Marksmanship,
    or Survival.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in combat update loop
    code: "void CombatUpdate()\n{\n    // ... other combat logic ...\n    hunter->UpdateRangeManagement();\n\
      \    // ... continue with combat processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with pet positioning changes
    code: "void OnPetPositionChanged()\n{\n    // Update pet positioning and range\
      \ management\n    if (player->GetPet())\n    {\n        player->GetPet()->UpdateRangeManagement();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during combat state updates and should not
    be invoked excessively outside of combat scenarios to maintain performance. The
    implementation may involve checking pet distance from owner, target visibility,
    and environmental obstacles that affect ability range.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method in tight loops or without proper state checks
    as it may cause unnecessary recalculations and impact performance. Ensure the
    hunter object has a valid pet before invoking this method to prevent potential
    null pointer exceptions.
