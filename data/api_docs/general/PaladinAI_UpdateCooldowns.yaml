  signature: void PaladinAI::UpdateCooldowns(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for Paladin abilities.
  description: The UpdateCooldowns method is responsible for managing and updating
    the internal cooldown timers for a Paladin's special abilities within the TrinityCore
    AI system. This method is typically called during each AI update cycle to ensure
    that cooldowns are properly tracked and that abilities can be used when their
    cooldowns have expired. It handles the decrementing of cooldown timers based on
    the time elapsed since the last update, and ensures that the AI logic correctly
    reflects which abilities are currently available for use.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time difference in milliseconds since the last update cycle.
      This value is used to accurately decrement cooldown timers based on real-time
      progression.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void PaladinAI::Update(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n\
      \    // Other AI logic...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom Paladin Behavior
    code: "void CustomPaladinAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_uiHolyShockCooldown\
      \ <= diff)\n    {\n        UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        // Execute Holy Shock\
      \ logic\n        m_uiHolyShockCooldown = 15000; // Reset cooldown\n    }\n \
      \   else\n    {\n        UpdateCooldowns(diff);\n        m_uiHolyShockCooldown\
      \ -= diff;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI update mechanism and should be called
    regularly to maintain accurate cooldown state. It's important to note that this
    method does not directly execute abilities, but rather manages their availability
    through cooldown tracking.
  warnings: Improper handling of the 'diff' parameter can lead to incorrect cooldown
    calculations. Always pass the actual time difference from the last update cycle
    to ensure accurate behavior.
