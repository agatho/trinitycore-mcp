  class: DynamicObject
  method: GetSpellId
  signature: int DynamicObject::GetSpellId() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the spell identifier associated with this dynamic object.
  description: The GetSpellId method returns the unique identifier of the spell that
    created this dynamic object. In World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, dynamic objects
    are temporary game entities such as area auras, trap effects, or spell visual
    effects that persist for a duration. This method allows scripts and systems to
    determine which spell originally spawned the dynamic object, enabling conditional
    logic based on spell type or effect. The returned value corresponds to the Spell::Id
    field from the spell database and is essential for identifying the originating
    spell's properties and behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the spell ID associated with this dynamic object.
    Returns 0 if no spell ID has been set or if the object was not created by a spell
    effect.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Identify Spell
    code: "void CheckDynamicObjectSpell(DynamicObject* dynObj)\n{\n    int spellId\
      \ = dynObj->GetSpellId();\n    if (spellId == 12345)\n    {\n        // Handle\
      \ specific spell effect\n        sLog->outString(\"Detected Fireball AoE effect\"\
      );\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spell ID for Conditional Logic
    code: "void ProcessDynamicObject(DynamicObject* dynObj)\n{\n    uint32 spellId\
      \ = dynObj->GetSpellId();\n    switch (spellId)\n    {\n        case 15407:\
      \ // Curse of Agony\n            // Apply special handling for this debuff\n\
      \            break;\n        case 12654: // Frost Nova\n            // Trigger\
      \ freezing effect\n            break;\n        default:\n            // Default\
      \ behavior\n            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in spell effect handling and custom AI logic
    where dynamic objects need to be identified by their originating spell. The returned
    spell ID can be used to query the SpellMgr for detailed spell information including
    duration, effects, and visual properties.
  warnings: Be aware that some dynamic objects may not have a valid spell ID set,
    particularly if they are created through non-standard means or custom code paths.
    Always validate the returned value before using it in critical logic.
