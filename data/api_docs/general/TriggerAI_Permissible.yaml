  class: TriggerAI
  method: Permissible
  signature: int TriggerAI::Permissible(const int * creature)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the TriggerAI class can be used with a given creature
    type.
  description: The Permissible method is used in TrinityCore's AI system to evaluate
    if a specific TriggerAI implementation should be assigned to a creature. This
    method acts as a filter mechanism, returning different integer values that indicate
    the level of permissiveness or suitability for a particular creature type. The
    return value typically follows a standard convention where positive values indicate
    strong suitability, zero indicates neutral or no preference, and negative values
    suggest incompatibility or disallowance. This method is crucial for dynamic AI
    assignment based on creature properties such as type, faction, or other identifying
    characteristics.
  parameters:
  - name: creature
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the creature's type ID or identifier.
      This value is used to determine if the TriggerAI can be applied to that specific
      creature type.
  returns: 'Returns an integer indicating the permissiveness level: positive values
    suggest strong suitability for AI assignment, zero means neutral/no preference,
    and negative values indicate incompatibility or disallowance of using this AI
    with the specified creature.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int TriggerAI::Permissible(const int* creature)\n{\n    if (*creature ==\
      \ 12345) // Example creature ID\n        return PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE;\n   \
      \ else if (*creature == 67890)\n        return PERMIT_BASE_REACTIVE;\n    else\n\
      \        return PERMIT_BASE_NO;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI system's initialization process and should
    be implemented carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks. The values returned
    must align with TrinityCore's AI permissible constants such as PERMIT_BASE_PROACTIVE,
    PERMIT_BASE_REACTIVE, and PERMIT_BASE_NO for consistent behavior across different
    AI implementations.
  warnings: Incorrect return value assignments can lead to improper AI assignment
    or runtime errors. Developers should ensure that the returned values are consistent
    with the expected enum values defined in the TrinityCore AI framework.
