documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player needs to farm for a specific profession.
  description: The NeedsFarming method evaluates if a player has sufficient resources
    or progress in a given profession to continue farming. It typically checks against
    internal criteria such as skill level, available materials, or quest requirements.
    This method is commonly used in the context of World of Warcraft's TrinityCore
    framework to manage player progression and resource allocation for crafting professions.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). Must not be null.
  - name: profession
    description: Enumeration value indicating the type of profession being evaluated.
      Valid values are defined by the ProfessionType enum.
  returns: Returns true if the player requires further farming or resource gathering
    for the specified profession; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "int playerId = 12345;\nProfessionType prof = PROFESSION_ENGINEERING;\n\
      bool needsFarming = coordinator.NeedsFarming(&playerId, prof);\nif (needsFarming)\
      \ {\n    // Player should continue farming\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Player State
    code: 'Player* player = session->GetPlayer();

      int playerId = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      ProfessionType prof = player->GetSkillValue(PROFESSION_ENGINEERING);

      bool needsFarming = coordinator.NeedsFarming(&playerId, prof);

      // Use result to determine next action in farming logic

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of player professions and may
    perform database lookups or cached checks depending on implementation. Ensure
    that the provided player ID is valid before calling.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely cause undefined
    behavior or runtime errors. Always validate input parameters before invoking this
    method.
