  method: GetCreatureType
  signature: uint32 Unit::GetCreatureType() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the creature type identifier for the unit.
  description: The GetCreatureType method retrieves the creature type value associated
    with a Unit object, which represents the classification of the creature in terms
    of its type (such as beast, dragon, elemental, etc.). This value is used primarily
    for determining creature behavior, AI targeting, and various game mechanics related
    to creature interactions. The method is commonly used in TrinityCore's creature
    AI systems and can be crucial for identifying specific creature types during combat
    or interaction scenarios.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 representing the creature type identifier, which corresponds
    to predefined creature type values in the game database. Possible values include
    0 for 'none', 1 for 'beast', 2 for 'dragonkin', 3 for 'elemental', 4 for 'giant',
    5 for 'undead', 6 for 'humanoid', 7 for 'critter', 8 for ' mechanical', 9 for
    'flying', and other values depending on the specific creature classification.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 creatureType = unit->GetCreatureType();\nif (creatureType == 1)\n\
      {\n    // Handle beast type creature\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread context. Performance-wise,
    it's a simple lookup operation that does not involve complex computations or database
    queries. The value returned is typically cached and does not require additional
    memory allocation.
  warnings: Care should be taken when comparing creature type values with hardcoded
    numbers, as these may change between different TrinityCore versions. Always use
    proper enum definitions or constants for comparisons to avoid breaking compatibility.
