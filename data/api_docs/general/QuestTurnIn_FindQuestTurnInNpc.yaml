  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: FindQuestTurnInNpc
  signature: bool QuestTurnIn::FindQuestTurnInNpc(Player * bot, uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the quest turn-in NPC for a given quest ID.
  description: The FindQuestTurnInNpc method searches for the appropriate non-player
    character (NPC) that accepts a specific quest from a player. It is typically used
    in AI or quest handling systems to determine which NPC should be interacted with
    to turn in a particular quest. The method performs internal lookups within the
    game's quest database and NPC data structures to locate the correct turn-in target.
    This functionality is essential for automated quest completion systems, botting
    logic, or quest tracking utilities in TrinityCore-based servers.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if a valid quest turn-in NPC was found and successfully identified;
    otherwise returns false if no suitable NPC exists for the given quest ID or if
    an error occurred during lookup.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find quest turn-in NPC
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume a valid player instance\nuint32 questId =\
      \ 12345;\nbool found = bot->FindQuestTurnInNpc(bot, questId);\nif (found)\n\
      {\n    // Proceed with interaction logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal quest and NPC data structures being properly
    initialized. Performance may be impacted if large numbers of quests are queried
    in rapid succession due to database lookups. The method assumes that the player
    object is valid and has access to the necessary quest data.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to a valid, active quest
    in the game world; otherwise, the method will return false without error. Do not
    use this method outside of appropriate quest handling contexts as it may cause
    unexpected behavior or crashes if used improperly.
