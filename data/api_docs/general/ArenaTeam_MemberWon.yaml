documentation:
  brief: Updates arena team statistics when a member wins a match, adjusting ratings
    and match history.
  description: The MemberWon method is responsible for updating an arena team's internal
    state when one of its members achieves a victory in an arena match. This includes
    adjusting the player's personal rating, updating the team's overall rating, and
    recording match outcomes. The method takes into account the opponent's matchmaker
    rating and applies the appropriate rating change based on the game's ranking system.
    It is typically invoked by the arena match system after a successful match conclusion
    to ensure proper tracking of player performance and team standings.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the member who won the
      arena match. Must be a valid player object that is part of the arena team.
  - name: againstMatchmakerRating
    description: The matchmaker rating of the opponent team or player against which
      the member won. Used to calculate the appropriate rating change based on the
      Elo-like system.
  - name: MatchmakerRatingChange
    description: The calculated rating change value that should be applied to the
      winning player's rating. Positive values indicate rating gain, negative values
      indicate rating loss.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Arena Match Completion
    code: "void OnArenaMatchEnd(ArenaTeam* team, Player* winner, uint32 opponentRating,\
      \ int32 ratingChange)\n{\n    team->MemberWon(winner, opponentRating, ratingChange);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Team Statistics After Victory
    code: "void HandleArenaVictory(Player* player, ArenaTeam* team, uint32 opponentRating)\n\
      {\n    int32 ratingChange = CalculateRatingChange(player->GetArenaPersonalRating(),\
      \ opponentRating);\n    team->MemberWon(player, opponentRating, ratingChange);\n\
      \    // Additional logic for updating win/loss records\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal arena match handling system and should
    not be called directly from external code without proper validation. The method
    modifies internal team statistics and player ratings, so it must be invoked only
    after verifying that the match result is legitimate. It assumes that the provided
    player is a valid member of the arena team.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid parameters can lead to incorrect rating
    calculations or team state corruption. Ensure that the player pointer is valid
    and that the rating change value accurately reflects the expected outcome based
    on the match result and opponent's rating.
