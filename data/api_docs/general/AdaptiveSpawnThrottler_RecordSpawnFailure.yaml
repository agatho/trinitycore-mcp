  class: AdaptiveSpawnThrottler
  method: RecordSpawnFailure
  signature: void AdaptiveSpawnThrottler::RecordSpawnFailure(int reason)
documentation:
  brief: Records a spawn failure with the specified reason for adaptive throttling
    logic.
  description: The RecordSpawnFailure method logs a spawn failure event within the
    AdaptiveSpawnThrottler class, which is used to manage and adjust spawn rates dynamically
    based on system performance or failure conditions. This method updates internal
    tracking mechanisms that help determine whether future spawns should be delayed
    or skipped to prevent system overload or resource exhaustion. It typically integrates
    with broader spawn management systems in TrinityCore to maintain optimal server
    performance under varying load conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: reason
    description: An integer value indicating the reason for the spawn failure. The
      specific values and their meanings are implementation-defined but generally
      represent different types of failures such as resource exhaustion, timeout,
      or collision detection issues.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in spawn logic
    code: 'AdaptiveSpawnThrottler throttler;

      // Simulate a failed spawn attempt due to resource constraints

      throttler.RecordSpawnFailure(1); // 1 might represent ''resource_limit_exceeded'''
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with spawn manager
    code: "class SpawnManager {\npublic:\n    void AttemptSpawn(GameObject* go) {\n\
      \        if (!go->Spawn()) {\n            throttler.RecordSpawnFailure(2); //\
      \ 2 might represent 'spawn_collision'\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    AdaptiveSpawnThrottler\
      \ throttler;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within spawn-related systems where failure
    tracking is essential for adaptive behavior. The internal logic may use the recorded
    failures to adjust spawn intervals or disable certain spawns temporarily.
  warnings: Ensure that the reason parameter accurately reflects the type of failure,
    as incorrect values could lead to improper throttling decisions and potentially
    degrade server performance.
