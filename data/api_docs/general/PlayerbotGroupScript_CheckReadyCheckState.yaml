  class: PlayerbotGroupScript
  method: CheckReadyCheckState
  signature: void PlayerbotGroupScript::CheckReadyCheckState(Group * group, GroupState
    & state)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the ready check state for a player group based on member participation.
  description: The CheckReadyCheckState method evaluates the current state of a group's
    ready check process, determining whether all group members have responded to a
    ready check request. This method is typically invoked during group activities
    such as dungeon or raid encounters where player readiness is required before proceeding.
    It modifies the provided GroupState object to reflect the collective status of
    the group members' responses. The implementation considers individual player states
    and updates the overall group readiness accordingly, ensuring that the game logic
    accurately reflects when a group is ready for action.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the player group being evaluated
      for ready check status. Must not be null.
  - name: state
    description: Reference to a GroupState object that will be updated with the current
      ready check state of the group members. The method modifies this object in-place.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void MyBotScript::OnGroupUpdate(Group* group)\n{\n    GroupState state;\n\
      \    playerbot->GetPlayerbotAI()->GetGroupScript()->CheckReadyCheckState(group,\
      \ state);\n    // Process the updated state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Playerbot AI system and is typically called internally
    by the group management logic. It assumes that the Group object passed in contains
    valid data about group members and their current ready check status. The GroupState
    object should be initialized before calling this method to ensure proper state
    tracking.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method, as passing a null pointer will likely result in undefined behavior or
    crashes. This method modifies the GroupState parameter in-place, so any existing
    data in that object may be overwritten.
