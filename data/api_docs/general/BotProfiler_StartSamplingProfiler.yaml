  class: BotProfiler
  method: StartSamplingProfiler
  signature: void BotProfiler::StartSamplingProfiler(uint32_t intervalMicroseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Starts the bot profiling sampling process with the specified interval.
  description: The StartSamplingProfiler method initiates a profiling mechanism that
    collects performance data from bot behaviors at regular intervals. This method
    is typically used for debugging and optimizing AI behavior in TrinityCore's bot
    system. The profiler will begin recording data points every 'intervalMicroseconds'
    microseconds until explicitly stopped. It allows developers to analyze how bots
    consume CPU resources and identify potential performance bottlenecks in their
    AI implementations.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMicroseconds
    description: The time interval in microseconds between each profiling sample collection.
      Must be a positive integer value representing the sampling frequency.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Profiler Start
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.StartSamplingProfiler(1000); // Sample every millisecond'
    language: cpp
  - title: High-Frequency Profiling
    code: 'BotProfiler profiler;

      profiler.StartSamplingProfiler(100); // Sample every 100 microseconds for detailed
      analysis'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely initializes internal timers and data structures required
    for profiling. The interval should be chosen carefully to balance between profiling
    granularity and system overhead. Profiling may impact performance during active
    bot operations, especially with very short intervals.
  warnings: Starting the profiler without stopping it can lead to resource leaks or
    unexpected behavior. Ensure that StopSamplingProfiler is called when profiling
    is no longer needed. Very small interval values (e.g., below 100 microseconds)
    may cause system instability due to excessive overhead.
