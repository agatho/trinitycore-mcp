documentation:
  brief: Assigns the contents of one Cell object to another Cell object
  description: The operator= method performs a deep copy assignment of all member
    variables from the source Cell object to the target Cell object. This method is
    essential for managing Cell objects within the TrinityCore world system, where
    cells represent specific geographic areas in the game world. The assignment operation
    ensures that all cell-related data such as coordinates, grid references, and associated
    objects are properly copied. This method supports proper object lifecycle management
    when Cell objects are reassigned or copied during world updates and object movement
    calculations.
  parameters:
  - name: cell
    description: The source Cell object whose contents will be copied to this Cell
      object
  returns: A reference to the current Cell object (this) after the assignment has
    been completed, enabling chained assignment operations
  examples:
  - title: Basic Cell Assignment
    code: 'Cell sourceCell(10, 20);

      Cell targetCell;

      targetCell = sourceCell; // Assigns contents of sourceCell to targetCell'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Assignment
    code: 'Cell cell1(5, 15);

      Cell cell2;

      Cell cell3;

      cell3 = cell2 = cell1; // Chained assignment of Cell objects'
    language: cpp
  notes: This operator is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    grid management operations and object relocation. The implementation likely handles
    reference counting or smart pointer management for associated world objects within
    the cell. Performance considerations are minimal as this is a standard assignment
    operation, but frequent assignments may impact performance in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: When assigning Cell objects that contain references to live game objects,
    ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions. The assignment does not
    automatically update any cached data or references in other systems - manual updates
    may be required in complex scenarios.
