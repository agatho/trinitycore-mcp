documentation:
  brief: Refreshes the black market auctions by updating their availability and resetting
    timers.
  description: The RefreshAuctions method is responsible for updating the state of
    black market auctions within the TrinityCore server. It typically handles the
    process of removing expired auctions, generating new ones, and ensuring that the
    auction list reflects current game conditions. This method is usually invoked
    periodically or upon specific game events to maintain the integrity and dynamic
    nature of the black market system. The method does not take any parameters and
    performs its operations internally using the BlackMarketMgr's internal data structures
    and timers.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BlackMarketMgr* bmMgr = sBlackMarketMgr;

      bmMgr->RefreshAuctions();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called by the server's update loop or triggered
    by game events. It may involve database operations to update auction states and
    should be executed in a thread-safe context if called from multiple threads.
  warnings: Calling this method manually outside of the normal update cycle may cause
    inconsistencies in auction data or unexpected behavior in the black market system.
