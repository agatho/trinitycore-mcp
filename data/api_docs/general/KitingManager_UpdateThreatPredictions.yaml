documentation:
  brief: Updates threat predictions for kiting behavior in combat situations
  description: The UpdateThreatPredictions method calculates and refreshes threat
    levels for nearby targets based on current combat state, movement patterns, and
    attack timing. This method is crucial for kiting AI logic that determines when
    to retreat, maintain distance, or engage enemies. It analyzes the player's current
    threat level, target aggro status, and environmental factors to predict future
    threat changes. The method updates internal threat prediction data structures
    used by the kiting manager for decision-making during combat encounters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Update Loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_kitingManager)\n   \
      \     m_kitingManager->UpdateThreatPredictions();\n    // ... other AI logic\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Combat State Management
    code: "void KitingManager::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    UpdateThreatPredictions();\n\
      \    // Additional initialization logic\n}\n\nvoid KitingManager::UpdateThreatPredictions()\n\
      {\n    // Internal threat prediction calculations\n    // ... implementation\
      \ details\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during combat updates to maintain
    accurate threat predictions. The method performs calculations based on current
    target positions, attack speeds, and damage outputs. It's designed to be lightweight
    but may have performance implications during high-frequency combat scenarios with
    multiple targets.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of combat context may produce inaccurate threat
    predictions. The method assumes valid target states and should not be invoked
    when targets are invalid or in transition states. Improper usage can lead to incorrect
    kiting decisions and suboptimal combat behavior.
