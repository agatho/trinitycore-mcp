  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadCreatureTemplateDifficulty()
documentation:
  brief: Loads creature template difficulty data from the database into memory for
    use in game calculations.
  description: The LoadCreatureTemplateDifficulty method initializes and populates
    internal data structures with creature template difficulty information stored
    in the database. This method is typically called during server startup or reload
    operations to ensure that all creature templates have their difficulty-specific
    attributes properly loaded. It processes entries from the creature_template_difficulty
    table, which defines how creatures behave differently across various difficulty
    levels (normal, heroic, mythic, etc.). The loaded data is used by the game engine
    to determine appropriate stats, loot, and other properties based on the current
    difficulty setting for a given instance or encounter.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::Initialize()\n{\n    // ... other initialization code\
      \ ...\n    ObjectMgr::Instance()->LoadCreatureTemplateDifficulty();\n    //\
      \ ... continue with rest of initialization ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called after the database connection is established
    and the creature_template_difficulty table has been properly populated. The method
    performs no locking internally, so concurrent access during loading should be
    avoided. It's recommended to call this method before any gameplay logic that might
    depend on difficulty-specific creature data.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal data structures. Ensure that the
    database contains valid and consistent difficulty data; malformed entries may
    cause runtime errors during creature spawning or encounter handling.
