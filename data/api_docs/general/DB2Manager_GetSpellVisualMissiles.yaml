documentation:
  brief: Retrieves an array of missile IDs associated with a specified spell visual
    missile set.
  description: The GetSpellVisualMissiles method retrieves a constant array of integer
    identifiers representing missile effects linked to a specific spell visual missile
    set ID. This function is typically used in the context of World of Warcraft's
    spell system to determine which visual missiles (projectiles) should be displayed
    when a spell with a particular visual set is cast. The returned pointer points
    to an internal data structure managed by the DB2Manager, and the array is terminated
    by a zero or negative value indicating the end of valid entries. This method does
    not perform any validation on the input ID and assumes that the provided spellVisualMissileSetId
    corresponds to a valid entry in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a constant integer array containing missile IDs associated
    with the specified spell visual missile set. The array is null-terminated, where
    each element represents a missile ID. Returns nullptr if no data is found for
    the given ID or if the internal data structure is not initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and iterate through missile IDs for a spell visual set
    code: "const int* missiles = sDB2Manager->GetSpellVisualMissiles(12345);\nif (missiles)\n\
      {\n    for (int i = 0; missiles[i] > 0; ++i)\n    {\n        printf(\"Missile\
      \ ID: %d\\n\", missiles[i]);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method accesses internal DB2 data structures and assumes that the DB2
    files have been loaded properly. The returned array is owned by the DB2Manager
    and should not be modified or freed by the caller. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this is a lookup operation, but repeated calls with varying IDs
    may cause cache misses if the data is not accessed sequentially.
  warnings: Do not assume that all spell visual missile set IDs will have associated
    missile entries. Always check for null return values and ensure that the array
    is properly terminated before iterating through it to avoid buffer overruns or
    undefined behavior.
