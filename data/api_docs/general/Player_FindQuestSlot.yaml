documentation:
  brief: Finds and returns the slot index of a quest in the player's quest log.
  description: The FindQuestSlot method searches through the player's quest log to
    locate the specific slot index where a given quest ID is stored. This method is
    essential for managing quest progress and determining the position of quests within
    the player's active quest list. The returned slot index corresponds to the quest's
    location in the player's quest log array, which can be used for various operations
    such as updating quest status, retrieving quest data, or modifying quest entries.
    The method operates on the principle that each quest has a unique slot assignment
    within the player's quest log, making it crucial for quest management and game
    mechanics implementation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the slot index (uint16) of the quest in the player's quest log.
    If the quest is not found, the method returns 0xFFFF (65535), indicating that
    no valid slot was located for the specified quest ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "uint16 slot = player->FindQuestSlot(quest_id);\nif (slot != 0xFFFF)\n{\n\
      \    // Quest found in slot\n    // Perform operations with the slot index\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used internally by TrinityCore to manage quest logs
    and their associated data. Performance considerations include the fact that this
    method may involve iterating through the player's quest log, which could impact
    performance if many quests are active. Thread safety is not a concern as this
    method is generally called from within a single thread context.
  warnings: The method returns 0xFFFF when no quest slot is found, which can be confused
    with an invalid slot index. Developers should ensure proper validation of the
    return value to avoid misinterpretation of quest status. Common mistakes include
    not checking for the special value 0xFFFF before using the returned slot index
    in operations.
