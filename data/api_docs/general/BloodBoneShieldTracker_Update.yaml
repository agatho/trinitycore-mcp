  class: BloodBoneShieldTracker
  method: Update
  signature: void BloodBoneShieldTracker::Update(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the blood bone shield status for the specified player bot.
  description: The Update method in the BloodBoneShieldTracker class is responsible
    for refreshing or recalculating the state of a blood bone shield effect applied
    to a player bot. This typically involves checking the current health, buff status,
    cooldowns, and any other relevant game mechanics that affect the shield's functionality.
    The method ensures that the shield's visual representation, damage absorption
    properties, and associated effects are accurately reflected in the game world
    for the specified player. It is commonly called during AI update cycles or when
    specific events occur that might alter the shield's state.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot whose blood bone
      shield status needs to be updated. Must not be null.
  returns: None. The method performs internal updates and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void BotAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (m_bot && m_bot->IsInWorld())\n\
      \    {\n        m_bloodBoneShieldTracker.Update(m_bot);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Shield After Health Change
    code: "void BotAI::HandleHealthChange(Unit* target, int32 damage)\n{\n    if (target\
      \ == m_bot)\n    {\n        m_bloodBoneShieldTracker.Update(m_bot);\n    }\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called on valid Player objects that are currently
    in the game world. The implementation likely involves checking internal shield
    state variables and updating corresponding visual or gameplay effects. It may
    also trigger related events or callbacks depending on the shield's current status.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot parameter is a valid, non-null pointer before calling
    this method to prevent undefined behavior. Calling Update on a player who is not
    in the world may lead to unexpected results or crashes.
