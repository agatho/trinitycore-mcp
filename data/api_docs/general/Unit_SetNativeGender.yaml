    determines the gender used for character creation and appearance. The gender parameter
    accepts values 0 (male), 1 (female), or 2 (none). This method is typically used
    during character creation or when changing gender in-game. It affects how the
    unit appears in the game world and can influence various gameplay mechanics related
    to gender-specific interactions.

  notes: This method directly affects the unit's appearance and can be used in conjunction
    with other gender-related methods. It should be called during initialization or
    when changing gender, as it may affect game mechanics related to gender-specific
    interactions.
  warnings: This method should not be called during combat or while the unit is in
    a state that could cause conflicts with existing game mechanics. Also, calling
    this method on non-player units might have unexpected effects on their appearance.
