documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the PoolMgr class
  description: The instance() method implements the singleton pattern for the PoolMgr
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the pool manager exists throughout the
    application. This method is commonly used to access global pool-related functionality
    such as object pooling, resource management, and efficient memory allocation for
    frequently created and destroyed game objects. The returned instance manages various
    pools including creature pools, game object pools, and quest pools that are essential
    for maintaining performance in World of Warcraft server environments.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the single PoolMgr instance. The method never returns NULL
    as it's implemented as a singleton with lazy initialization.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing the Pool Manager Singleton
    code: 'PoolMgr* poolManager = PoolMgr::instance();

      // Use poolManager to access pool-related functionality

      uint32 poolId = poolManager->GetNextPoolId();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Pool Manager for Creature Pool Operations
    code: "PoolMgr* pm = PoolMgr::instance();\n// Get a reference to a specific creature\
      \ pool\nif (pm)\n{\n    // Perform pool operations\n    pm->AddCreatureToPool(12345,\
      \ 67890);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses lazy initialization, meaning the PoolMgr instance is created
    only when first accessed. The singleton pattern ensures thread safety in TrinityCore's
    multi-threaded environment through proper synchronization mechanisms. This is
    a core utility class used extensively throughout the server codebase for managing
    various pool systems.
  warnings: Since this is a singleton, calling this method repeatedly will always
    return the same instance pointer. Developers should not attempt to manually delete
    or destroy the returned instance as it's managed automatically by the system.
