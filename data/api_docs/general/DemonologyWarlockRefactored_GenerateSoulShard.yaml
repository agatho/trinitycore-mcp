documentation:
  brief: Generates soul shards for the demonology warlock based on specified amount
  description: The GenerateSoulShard method is responsible for creating and adding
    soul shards to a demonology warlock's resource pool. This method typically gets
    invoked when the warlock performs actions that grant soul shard generation, such
    as casting spells or using abilities that produce soul shards. The generated shards
    are added to the warlock's current soul shard count, which can then be consumed
    for various demonic abilities and spells. This method is crucial for managing
    the warlock's resource system and maintaining proper gameplay balance within the
    demonology specialization.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Soul Shard Generation
    code: 'DemonologyWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.GenerateSoulShard(1);

      // Generates 1 soul shard for the warlock'
    language: cpp
  - title: Multiple Soul Shard Generation
    code: 'DemonologyWarlockRefactored warlock;

      warlock.GenerateSoulShard(5);

      // Generates 5 soul shards for the warlock

      // Useful when multiple abilities are triggered simultaneously'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the warlock's internal resource tracking
    system and may trigger visual effects or UI updates to reflect the newly generated
    soul shards. It should be called only when appropriate game conditions are met,
    such as during spell casts or ability activations.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper game state validation may lead to incorrect
    resource accumulation or game balance issues. Ensure that soul shard generation
    follows the correct game mechanics and restrictions for the demonology specialization.
