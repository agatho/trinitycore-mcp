documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the count of available quests for the player
  description: The GetAvailableQuests method returns the total number of quests that
    are currently available to the player based on their level, quest log status,
    and other game conditions. This method is typically used by the quest system to
    determine how many active or eligible quests a player can accept or interact with.
    It does not return quest data itself but rather provides a count that can be used
    to iterate through available quests or display quest information in the user interface.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of available quests for the player.
    Returns 0 if no quests are available or if the player is not properly initialized
    within the quest system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check available quests
    code: "int availableQuests = player->GetQuestManager()->GetAvailableQuests();\n\
      if (availableQuests > 0)\n{\n    // Display available quests\n    printf(\"\
      Player has %d available quests\\n\", availableQuests);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during quest update cycles or when the player
    opens the quest log. The returned count may change dynamically as the player progresses
    through quests or meets prerequisites. Implementation relies on internal quest
    tracking and player state validation.
