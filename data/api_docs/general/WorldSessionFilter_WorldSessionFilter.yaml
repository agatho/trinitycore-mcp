  method: WorldSessionFilter
  signature: void WorldSessionFilter::WorldSessionFilter(WorldSession * pSession)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a WorldSessionFilter object with the specified session pointer.
  description: The WorldSessionFilter constructor initializes a filter object that
    can be used to process or validate World of Warcraft client sessions. This class
    is typically used within the TrinityCore server framework to manage and filter
    session-related operations, such as handling incoming packets or validating session
    states. The constructor accepts a pointer to a WorldSession object which represents
    the current client connection state and context. It sets up internal state variables
    for session filtering and prepares the object for subsequent operations like packet
    validation or session management tasks.
  parameters:
  - name: pSession
    description: Pointer to the WorldSession object that this filter will be associated
      with. This represents the client connection context and contains all session-specific
      data including player information, connection state, and packet handling context.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Session Filter Initialization
    code: 'WorldSession* session = new WorldSession(1);

      WorldSessionFilter filter(session);

      // The filter is now initialized with the session context'
    language: cpp
  - title: Session Filter in Packet Handling Context
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogin(WorldPacket& packet)\n{\n    WorldSession* session\
      \ = nullptr;\n    // ... session retrieval logic ...\n    if (session)\n   \
      \ {\n        WorldSessionFilter filter(session);\n        // Use filter for\
      \ session validation or packet processing\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation on the input session pointer.
    It's assumed that the caller has already validated that pSession is a valid pointer
    to an initialized WorldSession object. The filter object maintains a reference
    to this session throughout its lifetime, so the referenced session must remain
    valid for as long as the filter is in use.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely cause undefined
    behavior or crashes when the filter attempts to access session data. Always ensure
    that pSession points to a properly initialized WorldSession object before calling
    this constructor.
