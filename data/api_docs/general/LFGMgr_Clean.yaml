  brief: Clears all LFG (Looking for Group) data and resets the manager state
  description: The Clean method in LFGMgr is responsible for completely clearing all
    active Looking for Group data structures and resetting the internal state of the
    LFG manager. This includes removing all pending group requests, clearing player
    queue entries, and resetting any internal tracking mechanisms used by the LFG
    system. The method ensures a clean slate for the LFG subsystem, typically called
    during server shutdown or when resetting LFG functionality. It is a critical maintenance
    function that helps prevent data corruption and ensures consistent behavior of
    the LFG system.

  notes: This method should only be called when the server is in a safe state where
    no active LFG operations are occurring. It's typically invoked during server shutdown
    or maintenance procedures to ensure clean state transitions.
