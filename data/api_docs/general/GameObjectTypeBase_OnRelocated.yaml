documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a game object is relocated within the world.
  description: The OnRelocated method is invoked whenever a GameObjectTypeBase instance
    is moved from one position to another in the game world. This method serves as
    a callback mechanism that allows derived classes to perform necessary updates
    or actions when an object's location changes. It is typically called during map
    transitions, teleportations, or any scenario where the object's coordinates are
    modified. The method does not take any parameters and does not return a value,
    making it a simple event handler for relocation events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in Custom GameObject
    code: "class MyGameObject : public GameObjectTypeBase {\npublic:\n    void OnRelocated()\
      \ override {\n        // Perform actions when object is relocated\n        UpdateVisibility();\n\
      \        SendUpdateToClients();\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be overridden in derived classes to implement custom behavior
    upon relocation. It's important to note that this method may be called frequently
    during map transitions, so implementations should be efficient and avoid heavy
    computations.
