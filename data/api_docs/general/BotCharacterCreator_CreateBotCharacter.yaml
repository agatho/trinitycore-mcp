  class: BotCharacterCreator
  method: CreateBotCharacter
  signature: CreateResult BotCharacterCreator::CreateBotCharacter(uint32 accountId,
    uint8 race, uint8 classId, uint8 gender, const std::string & name, int & outGuid,
    std::string & outErrorMsg)
documentation:
  brief: Creates a new bot character for the specified account with the given attributes.
  description: The CreateBotCharacter method is responsible for generating a new bot
    character within the TrinityCore framework. It accepts account details, race,
    class, gender, and name to construct a valid character entry in the database.
    The method ensures that all provided parameters are validated before attempting
    creation. If successful, it returns the GUID of the newly created character and
    sets an empty error message. In case of failure, it provides a descriptive error
    message through outErrorMsg and leaves outGuid undefined. This function is typically
    used by game masters or automated systems to programmatically add bot characters
    for testing or gameplay purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: accountId
    description: Unique identifier of the account to which the character will belong.
      Must be a valid existing account ID in the database.
  - name: race
    description: Race of the character, represented as an integer value matching TrinityCore's
      race constants (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for Orc).
  - name: classId
    description: Class of the character, represented as an integer value matching
      TrinityCore's class constants (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin).
  - name: gender
    description: Gender of the character, either 0 for male or 1 for female.
  - name: name
    description: Unique name for the character. Must be between 3 and 12 characters
      long and not already in use by another character.
  - name: outGuid
    description: Output parameter that receives the unique global identifier (GUID)
      of the newly created character upon successful completion.
  - name: outErrorMsg
    description: Output parameter that receives a descriptive error message if character
      creation fails. Empty string indicates success.
  returns: 'Returns a CreateResult enum indicating the outcome of the operation:

    - SUCCESS: Character was created successfully.

    - FAILED: General failure during creation process.

    - NAME_IN_USE: Provided name is already taken by another character.

    - INVALID_RACE_CLASS: Specified race and class combination is not valid.

    - ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: Account has reached maximum allowed characters.

    - OTHER: Other unspecified error conditions.'

      \    std::cout << \"Character created with GUID: \" << guid << std::endl;\n\
      \    break;\ncase CreateResult::NAME_IN_USE:\n    std::cout << \"Name already\
      \ taken!\" << std::endl;\n    break;\ncase CreateResult::INVALID_RACE_CLASS:\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Invalid race/class combination.\" << std::endl;\n    break;\n\
      default:\n    std::cout << \"Creation failed: \" << errorMsg << std::endl;\n\
      \    break;\n}"

  notes: This method performs database operations and should be used carefully in
    performance-sensitive contexts. It assumes that the provided account ID exists
    and has sufficient permissions to create a character. The method does not validate
    character name uniqueness against other bots or players unless explicitly checked
    by the system.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are properly validated before calling
    this method, especially accountId, race, classId, and gender values. Using invalid
    combinations may lead to unexpected behavior or database corruption. Avoid calling
    this method from high-frequency loops without proper rate limiting.
