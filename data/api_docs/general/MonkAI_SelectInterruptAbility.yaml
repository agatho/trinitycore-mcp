  class: MonkAI
  method: SelectInterruptAbility
  signature: int MonkAI::SelectInterruptAbility()
documentation:
  brief: Selects the most appropriate interrupt ability for the Monk AI to use during
    combat.
  description: The SelectInterruptAbility method determines which interrupt ability
    should be used by the Monk AI when an enemy attempts to cast a spell or perform
    an action that can be interrupted. This method evaluates the current state of
    the monk, available abilities, and the target's casting status to select the most
    effective interrupt technique. It is typically called during the AI's update cycle
    when interrupt opportunities arise. The method considers factors such as mana
    availability, ability cooldowns, and the type of spell being cast by the enemy.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the ID of the selected interrupt ability.
    A return value of 0 indicates no valid interrupt ability was available or selected.
    Positive values correspond to specific ability IDs defined in the Monk's spell
    database, while negative values may indicate error conditions or special cases.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(const uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (Unit* target = GetVictim())\n\
      \    {\n        int interruptAbility = SelectInterruptAbility();\n        if\
      \ (interruptAbility > 0)\n        {\n            // Use the selected interrupt\
      \ ability\n            DoCast(interruptAbility);\n        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the Monk AI's core combat decision-making system.
    It should be called only when there is a valid target and an interrupt opportunity
    exists. The implementation may vary based on the specific monk class specialization
    (Mistweaver, Windwalker, Brewmaster) as each has different interrupt abilities
    available.
  warnings: Ensure that the method is not called in situations where no valid interrupt
    ability exists, as this could lead to unexpected behavior or failed spell casts.
    The returned ability ID must be validated before use to prevent runtime errors.
