  method: RemoveCorpse
  signature: void Creature::RemoveCorpse(bool setSpawnTime, bool destroyForNearbyPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Removes the creature's corpse from the world, optionally setting spawn time
    and destroying for nearby players.
  description: The RemoveCorpse method removes a creature's corpse from the game world,
    allowing for proper cleanup of the creature's body. When called, this method will
    destroy the corpse and potentially set the respawn time depending on the parameters
    provided. The method is typically used during creature death or when the creature
    needs to be removed from the world for gameplay reasons. It ensures that the creature's
    corpse does not remain in the world indefinitely, which could cause issues with
    game mechanics such as loot generation or player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: setSpawnTime
    description: If true, sets the respawn time for the creature's corpse; if false,
      the corpse will be destroyed immediately without setting a spawn time.
  - name: destroyForNearbyPlayers
    description: If true, destroys the corpse for nearby players, ensuring they cannot
      interact with it; if false, the corpse remains visible to nearby players but
      is removed from the world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: creature->RemoveCorpse(true, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage
    code: 'creature->RemoveCorpse(false, true);

      // This removes the corpse immediately but keeps it visible to nearby players'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during creature death or when a creature
    needs to be removed from the world. It should be used carefully as it affects
    the creature's respawn behavior and can impact game mechanics such as loot generation
    or player interactions with the corpse.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may cause issues with creature respawn timing
    or player interaction with the corpse. Always ensure that the parameters are set
    correctly to avoid unintended consequences in gameplay.
