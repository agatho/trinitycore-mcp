api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: SetAuctionProfile
  signature: void AuctionHouse::SetAuctionProfile(uint32 playerGuid, const AuctionProfile
    & profile)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the auction profile for a specified player.
  description: The SetAuctionProfile method updates or initializes the auction behavior
    settings for a given player identified by their GUID. This profile typically contains
    configuration data such as bid thresholds, auction duration settings, and other
    player-specific auction preferences. The method is used internally by the auction
    house system to maintain individual player configurations and ensure consistent
    auction behavior across sessions. It is expected that this method is called when
    a player's auction settings are modified or when loading their saved auction preferences
    from the database.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player whose auction profile
      is being set. Must be a valid player GUID within the game world.
  - name: profile
    description: An AuctionProfile object containing the auction settings to be applied
      to the specified player. This includes various configuration options such as
      bid amounts, auction durations, and other player-specific auction behaviors.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a Basic Auction Profile
    code: 'AuctionProfile profile;

      profile.minBid = 1000;

      profile.auctionDuration = 3600;

      player->GetAuctionHouse()->SetAuctionProfile(playerGuid, profile);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Player's Auction Settings
    code: 'AuctionProfile updatedProfile = player->GetAuctionHouse()->GetAuctionProfile(playerGuid);

      updatedProfile.maxBid = 100000;

      updatedProfile.enableAutoBid = true;

      player->GetAuctionHouse()->SetAuctionProfile(playerGuid, updatedProfile);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during player login or when auction settings
    are changed via in-game UI. The AuctionProfile object should be validated before
    calling this method to ensure data integrity. Changes made through this method
    may not persist immediately to the database unless explicitly saved by the calling
    code.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid player GUID may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the AuctionProfile being passed is properly initialized
    and contains valid values to prevent configuration errors in auction mechanics.
