documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BotTalentManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BotTalentManager class is responsible for releasing
    all memory and resources allocated during the object's lifetime. This includes
    cleaning up any internal data structures related to bot talent management, such
    as cached talent trees, temporary skill mappings, or references to player data.
    The destructor ensures proper resource deallocation when a BotTalentManager instance
    is no longer needed, preventing memory leaks in the TrinityCore environment. It
    is automatically invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of BotTalentManager
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    BotTalentManager manager;\n    // ... use manager\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when manager goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of BotTalentManager
    code: 'BotTalentManager* manager = new BotTalentManager();

      // ... use manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers destructor

      manager = nullptr;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless explicitly managing memory.
    In most cases, the destructor is invoked automatically by the C++ runtime when
    objects go out of scope or are deleted. Ensure that no other threads are accessing
    the BotTalentManager instance during destruction to avoid race conditions.
