  class: SceneObject
  method: SetCreatedBySpellCast
  signature: void SceneObject::SetCreatedBySpellCast(int castId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the spell cast ID that created this scene object.
  description: The SetCreatedBySpellCast method assigns a spell cast identifier to
    a SceneObject, linking it to a specific spell casting event. This is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's spell system to track which spell caused a particular
    scene object to be created. The method does not perform any validation on the
    input value and simply stores the provided cast ID. Scene objects created by spells
    often have special behaviors or visual effects tied to their originating spell,
    making this linkage important for proper game mechanics and event handling.
  parameters:
  - name: castId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell cast that created this scene object.
      This value is typically obtained from the Spell::GetCastId() method or similar
      spell tracking mechanisms.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();

      sceneObj->SetCreatedBySpellCast(12345);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting
    code: 'Spell* spell = new Spell(player, spellInfo, true);

      spell->Prepare();

      SceneObject* sceneObj = new SceneObject();

      sceneObj->SetCreatedBySpellCast(spell->GetCastId());'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the TrinityCore framework when
    creating scene objects as part of spell effects. The cast ID stored here may be
    used later for spell tracking, event callbacks, or debugging purposes. It's important
    to note that this method does not validate whether the provided castId corresponds
    to an actual active spell cast.
  warnings: Incorrectly setting the cast ID can lead to inconsistent behavior in spell-related
    scene objects. Ensure that the castId parameter is properly obtained from a valid
    spell casting context before calling this method. Using invalid or stale cast
    IDs may cause unexpected issues with spell effects or object cleanup.
