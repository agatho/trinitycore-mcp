  class: MovementRequest
  method: SetSourceSystem
  signature: MovementRequest & MovementRequest::SetSourceSystem(std::string sourceSystem)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the source system identifier for a movement request
  description: The SetSourceSystem method assigns a string identifier representing
    the originating system or subsystem that initiated the movement request. This
    is typically used in TrinityCore's movement handling system to track where movement
    commands come from, which can be important for debugging, logging, or enforcing
    system-specific movement rules. The method returns a reference to the current
    MovementRequest object to enable method chaining.
  parameters:
  - name: sourceSystem
    description: A string identifier representing the source system that initiated
      this movement request. This could be a subsystem name, module identifier, or
      any meaningful string tag for tracking purposes.
  returns: Returns a reference to the current MovementRequest object, enabling method
    chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SetSourceSystem
    code: 'MovementRequest request;

      request.SetSourceSystem("PlayerMovementModule");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method chaining with SetSourceSystem
    code: "MovementRequest request;\nrequest.SetSourceSystem(\"AIController\")\n \
      \      .SetDestination({100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f})\n       .SetSpeed(5.0f);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly used in TrinityCore's movement system to maintain
    traceability of movement requests across different subsystems. The source system
    identifier may be logged or used for debugging purposes.
