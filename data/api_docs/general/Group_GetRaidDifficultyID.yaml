  class: Group
  method: GetRaidDifficultyID
  signature: int Group::GetRaidDifficultyID() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the raid difficulty identifier for the group.
  description: The GetRaidDifficultyID method retrieves the current raid difficulty
    setting for the group. This identifier corresponds to the difficulty levels defined
    in the game's configuration, such as normal, heroic, and mythic modes. The returned
    value represents the specific difficulty tier that the group is currently operating
    under for raid content. This method is typically used to determine the appropriate
    loot distribution, encounter scaling, and other difficulty-specific behaviors
    within raid instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the raid difficulty ID. Common values include 0
    for normal difficulty, 1 for heroic difficulty, and 2 for mythic difficulty, though
    exact values may vary based on game version and configuration.
  examples:
  - title: Check Raid Difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    int difficultyId\
      \ = group->GetRaidDifficultyID();\n    if (difficultyId == 1)\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Group is in Heroic mode.\");\n    else if (difficultyId == 2)\n        ChatHandler(player->GetSession()).PSendSysMessage(\"\
      Group is in Mythic mode.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only returns meaningful values for raid groups. For non-raid
    groups, the behavior may be undefined or return a default value. The difficulty
    ID returned corresponds to the internal game difficulty definitions and should
    not be confused with user-facing difficulty names.
