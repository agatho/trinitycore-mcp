documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the discipline priest is currently assigned to a tanking
    role.
  description: The IsTankRole method evaluates the current role assignment of the
    Discipline Priest AI instance. It checks if the priest is designated as a primary
    or secondary tank within the group context, which affects spell selection, cooldown
    management, and defensive priority decisions. This method typically integrates
    with TrinityCore's raid management systems to ensure proper role-based behavior
    during encounters. The method does not require any parameters and returns a boolean
    value indicating the current tanking status.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the Discipline Priest is currently assigned to a tanking
    role; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI decision making
    code: "if (priest->IsTankRole()) {\n    // Apply defensive cooldowns and mitigation\
      \ spells\n    priest->CastSpell(target, SPELL_PENANCE, true);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Focus on healing and mana management\n    priest->CastSpell(target, SPELL_FLASH_HEAL,\
      \ true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal state tracking of the AI's role assignment.
    The result may change dynamically during combat based on group composition or
    encounter mechanics. It is recommended to cache this value if used frequently
    within a single update cycle.
  warnings: Do not assume that a priest marked as tanking will always be in direct
    threat generation mode. The method only indicates role assignment, not current
    combat state or threat level.
