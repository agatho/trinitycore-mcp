  method: operator=
  signature: WaypointMgr & WaypointMgr::operator=(WaypointMgr && param0)
documentation:
  brief: Moves a WaypointMgr object by transferring ownership of its resources to
    another WaypointMgr instance.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment operation on the WaypointMgr
    class, transferring all resources from the source object (param0) to the current
    object. This is typically used in scenarios where you want to efficiently transfer
    ownership of waypoint data structures without copying them. The move assignment
    operator is part of the C++ standard library's move semantics and allows for efficient
    resource management when dealing with complex objects like WaypointMgr which likely
    manages collections of waypoints or pathfinding data. After the operation, the
    source object will be left in a valid but unspecified state.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: The rvalue reference to another WaypointMgr instance whose resources
      will be moved to this object. This parameter represents the source of the move
      operation and should be a temporary object or explicitly moved object.
  returns: A reference to the current WaypointMgr object (this) after the move assignment
    has been completed, allowing for chaining of assignments.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'WaypointMgr mgr1;

      // ... populate mgr1 with waypoints ...

      WaypointMgr mgr2 = std::move(mgr1); // Uses move constructor

      // mgr1 is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // mgr2 contains all the waypoints from mgr1'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chained Move Assignment
    code: 'WaypointMgr mgr1;

      WaypointMgr mgr2;

      WaypointMgr mgr3;

      // ... populate managers with data ...

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr2); // Move mgr2''s resources to mgr1

      mgr1 = std::move(mgr3); // Move mgr3''s resources to mgr1

      // Note: This overwrites the previous contents of mgr1'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the move semantics implementation for WaypointMgr.
    It assumes that the class manages dynamic memory or other resources that can be
    efficiently transferred rather than copied. The move assignment operator should
    be used when you no longer need the source object's data after the operation.
    This is particularly useful in performance-critical code paths where waypoint
    data structures may be large or complex.
  warnings: Be cautious when using move assignment with objects that are still referenced
    elsewhere, as the source object will be left in a valid but unspecified state.
    Ensure that no other code relies on the original object's contents after a move
    operation. Also, avoid moving from an object that is currently being used by other
    threads without proper synchronization.
