  class: EssenceManager
  method: Update
  signature: void EssenceManager::Update(int diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the essence manager state based on the elapsed game time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and managing the internal
    state of the EssenceManager class. It typically handles periodic operations such
    as updating essence cooldowns, refreshing essence effects, or performing maintenance
    tasks related to player essence resources. This method is called regularly by
    the game loop with a time delta parameter that represents the milliseconds elapsed
    since the last update. The implementation may vary depending on the specific essence
    mechanics being managed, but generally involves checking for expired essence states,
    applying necessary updates, and ensuring synchronization between server and client
    states.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time delta in milliseconds since the last update call. This value
      is used to calculate time-based changes such as cooldown reductions or effect
      durations.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    static uint32 lastUpdate = 0;\n    uint32 currentTime\
      \ = getMSTime();\n    uint32 diff = currentTime - lastUpdate;\n    \n    if\
      \ (diff > 0)\n    {\n        essenceManager.Update(diff);\n        lastUpdate\
      \ = currentTime;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called frequently by the game loop to ensure proper
    essence state management. The diff parameter is crucial for accurate time-based
    calculations and should represent actual elapsed time in milliseconds.
  warnings: Do not call this method with incorrect or negative time deltas as it may
    cause unexpected behavior in essence cooldowns or effects. Ensure that the update
    frequency aligns with game loop timing to maintain synchronization.
