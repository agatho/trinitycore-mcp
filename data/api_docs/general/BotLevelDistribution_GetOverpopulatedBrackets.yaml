  class: BotLevelDistribution
  method: GetOverpopulatedBrackets
  signature: int BotLevelDistribution::GetOverpopulatedBrackets(int faction) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the number of overpopulated level brackets for the
    specified faction in the bot distribution system.
  description: The GetOverpopulatedBrackets method determines how many level brackets
    are currently overpopulated for a given faction within the bot distribution system.
    This is used to balance the number of bots across different levels and factions,
    ensuring that no single bracket has too many bots relative to others. The method
    evaluates the current distribution against predefined thresholds or limits set
    for each faction. It's typically called during bot management processes to identify
    imbalances that require corrective action. The result represents a count of brackets
    where the bot population exceeds acceptable limits.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of overpopulated level brackets
    for the specified faction. A return value of zero indicates no brackets are overpopulated,
    while a positive integer indicates the count of brackets that exceed the maximum
    allowed bot population for their respective levels.
  examples:
  - title: Check Overpopulation for Alliance
    code: "int overpopulatedAlliance = botLevelDistribution.GetOverpopulatedBrackets(FACTION_ALLIANCE);\n\
      if (overpopulatedAlliance > 0) {\n    // Handle overpopulation for alliance\
      \ bots\n    LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Found {} overpopulated brackets for Alliance\
      \ bots\", overpopulatedAlliance);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal data structures that track bot counts
    per level bracket and faction. The implementation may involve iterating through
    predefined level ranges and comparing current bot counts against threshold values.
    Performance is generally low since it's a simple counting operation, but frequent
    calls could impact server performance during high-traffic periods.
  warnings: The method assumes valid faction IDs are passed; invalid faction values
    might lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. This method should not
    be called during active bot spawning operations as the counts may change mid-execution.
