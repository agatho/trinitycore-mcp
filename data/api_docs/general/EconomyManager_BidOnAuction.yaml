  class: EconomyManager
  method: BidOnAuction
  signature: bool EconomyManager::BidOnAuction(uint32 auctionId, uint32 bidAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Places a bid on a specified auction item within the EconomyManager system.
  description: The BidOnAuction method allows players or systems to place a bid on
    an existing auction item by providing the auction's unique identifier and the
    desired bid amount. This method interacts with the auction house system to validate
    the bid, check if it meets the minimum required increment, and update the auction
    state accordingly. It returns true if the bid was successfully placed, and false
    if the bid failed due to invalid parameters, insufficient funds, or if the bid
    did not meet the auction's minimum requirements. The method is typically used
    in conjunction with other EconomyManager functions for managing in-game commerce.
  parameters:
  - name: auctionId
    description: The unique identifier of the auction item to place a bid on. This
      ID must correspond to an active auction in the system.
  - name: bidAmount
    description: The amount of currency the bidder wishes to offer for the auction
      item. Must be equal to or greater than the current bid plus the minimum bid
      increment.
  returns: True if the bid was successfully placed on the auction, false otherwise.
    A return value of false may indicate invalid auction ID, insufficient funds, or
    bid amount below minimum required.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bid Placement
    code: "if (economyManager.BidOnAuction(12345, 1000)) {\n    // Bid placed successfully\n\
      \    printf(\"Bid placed on auction 12345 for 1000 gold\\n\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // Failed to place bid\n    printf(\"Failed to place bid on auction 12345\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Bid Placement with Validation
    code: "uint32 auctionId = 67890;\nuint32 bidAmount = player->GetMoney() / 10;\
      \ // Bid 10% of player's money\nif (bidAmount > 0 && economyManager.BidOnAuction(auctionId,\
      \ bidAmount)) {\n    printf(\"Player placed a valid bid of %u on auction %u\\\
      n\", bidAmount, auctionId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Invalid bid or auction not\
      \ found\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the database to update auction records
    and player money. It may also trigger notifications or events related to auction
    updates. The implementation should be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded
    environment.
  warnings: Ensure that bidAmount is valid and sufficient before calling this function,
    as invalid bids will not be accepted. Also, be aware that placing a bid may result
    in immediate deduction of funds from the player's account.
