  class: RoleAssignment
  method: IsCompositionViable
  signature: bool RoleAssignment::IsCompositionViable(const GroupComposition & composition)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given group composition meets the requirements for a
    valid role assignment in World of Warcraft.
  description: The IsCompositionViable method evaluates a GroupComposition object
    to determine if it represents a valid and balanced group setup for dungeon or
    raid encounters. It checks that all necessary roles (tank, healer, damage dealer)
    are appropriately filled according to game rules and restrictions. This method
    is typically used during group creation or when attempting to form a party for
    content that requires specific role distributions. The evaluation considers factors
    such as class distribution, role balance, and any special requirements imposed
    by the encounter type.
  parameters:
  - name: composition
    description: A reference to a GroupComposition object containing the current group's
      member roles and classes. This parameter represents the complete set of players
      and their assigned roles within the group.
  returns: Returns true if the group composition is viable for the intended encounter,
    meaning it satisfies all role distribution requirements and class restrictions.
    Returns false if the composition fails to meet necessary criteria such as missing
    required roles or having an invalid class distribution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to validate a group composition
    code: "GroupComposition comp;\n// ... populate comp with players and roles ...\n\
      if (roleAssignment.IsCompositionViable(comp)) {\n    // Proceed with dungeon/raid\
      \ entry\n    std::cout << \"Group is viable for entry\" << std::endl;\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Notify player that group composition needs adjustment\n    std::cout\
      \ << \"Invalid group composition\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks against predefined rulesets for different
    encounter types. The implementation may vary based on the specific content type
    (dungeon, raid, battleground) and difficulty level. It's designed to prevent invalid
    group formations that could cause gameplay issues or server-side errors.
  warnings: Ensure that the GroupComposition object passed to this method is properly
    initialized with valid player data before calling. Passing an empty or malformed
    composition may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
