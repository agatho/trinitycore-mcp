  class: Pet
  method: DeleteFromDB
  signature: void Pet::DeleteFromDB(uint32 petNumber)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a pet's data from the database using its unique pet number identifier.
  description: The DeleteFromDB method removes all stored information about a specific
    pet from the database. This includes the pet's stats, experience, inventory, and
    any other persistent data associated with it. The method takes a pet number (typically
    the pet's entry ID or instance identifier) to identify which pet record should
    be deleted. This operation is typically called when a pet is dismissed, abandoned,
    or released from the player's control. The deletion affects only the database
    records and does not immediately remove the pet object from memory if it still
    exists in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: petNumber
    description: The unique identifier number for the pet to be deleted from the database.
      This typically corresponds to the pet's entry ID or instance identifier used
      to distinguish it from other pets.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a pet from database by pet number
    code: "Pet* myPet = player->GetPet();\nif (myPet)\n{\n    myPet->DeleteFromDB(myPet->GetEntry());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects database persistence and does not immediately destroy
    the pet object in memory. It is recommended to ensure that the pet is no longer
    referenced by any player or system before calling this method to avoid dangling
    references.
  warnings: Calling this method on a pet that is currently active in the game world
    may lead to inconsistent state if other systems still reference it. Always verify
    that the pet is properly dismissed or removed from gameplay before deletion.
