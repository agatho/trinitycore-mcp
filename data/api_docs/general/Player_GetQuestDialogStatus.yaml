  signature: int Player::GetQuestDialogStatus(const int * questGiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the quest dialog status for a given quest giver.
  description: This method retrieves the quest dialog status for a specific quest
    giver, which determines how the quest dialog should be displayed to the player.
    The status is based on the player's current quest progress and the quest giver's
    relationship with the player. It typically returns values indicating whether the
    quest is available, completed, or in progress, and affects the visual presentation
    of quest dialog options in the game interface.
  parameters:
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to the quest giver object that determines the dialog status.
      This parameter represents the NPC or object that provides the quest, and its
      value must be valid for the method to function correctly.
  returns: 'Returns an integer representing the quest dialog status, which can be
    one of several values indicating different states: 0 means no quest dialog, 1
    means available but not completed, 2 means completed, 3 means quest is in progress,
    and 4 means quest is not available due to prerequisites or other conditions.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: int status = player->GetQuestDialogStatus(&questGiver);
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with quest dialog handling logic
    to determine how quests should be presented to players. It requires valid quest
    giver objects and may involve complex game mechanics related to quest progression,
    reputation, and prerequisites.
  warnings: This method should not be used directly without proper validation of the
    quest giver object. Incorrect usage can lead to invalid dialog states or display
    issues in the quest interface.
