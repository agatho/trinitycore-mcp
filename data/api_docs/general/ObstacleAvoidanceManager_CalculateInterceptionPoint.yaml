  method: CalculateInterceptionPoint
  signature: int ObstacleAvoidanceManager::CalculateInterceptionPoint(const int &
    target, const int & targetVel, const int & interceptor, float interceptorSpeed)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates the optimal interception point for an interceptor to reach a moving
    target.
  description: The CalculateInterceptionPoint method determines the precise location
    where an interceptor, moving at a specified speed, will meet a target that is
    also in motion. This method is typically used in AI pathfinding and pursuit mechanics
    within the TrinityCore framework. It computes the point of intersection based
    on the current positions and velocities of both entities, assuming linear motion.
    The result represents a coordinate or identifier for the calculated interception
    point, which can be used to guide movement or trigger events.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: The current position or identifier of the target entity that is moving.
  - name: targetVel
    description: The velocity vector or speed of the target entity, indicating its
      direction and rate of movement.
  - name: interceptor
    description: The current position or identifier of the interceptor entity that
      will attempt to intercept the target.
  - name: interceptorSpeed
    description: The maximum speed at which the interceptor can move, used to calculate
      the time and path required for interception.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing either a unique identifier (GUID)
    of the calculated interception point or a coordinate index. A negative return
    may indicate failure in calculation due to invalid parameters or impossible interception
    scenarios.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Interception Calculation
    code: int interceptionPoint = obstacleAvoidanceManager.CalculateInterceptionPoint(targetPos,
      targetVelocity, interceptorPos, interceptorSpeed);
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Return Value for Movement
    code: "int point = manager.CalculateInterceptionPoint(targetGuid, targetVel, interceptorGuid,\
      \ 10.0f);\nif (point >= 0) {\n    // Move interceptor to calculated point\n\
      \    MoveToInterceptionPoint(point);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes constant velocity for both the target and interceptor.
    It does not account for acceleration or complex movement patterns. The calculation
    may fail if the interceptor's speed is insufficient to reach the target before
    it moves out of range.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are valid and within expected ranges;
    invalid inputs such as zero or negative speeds can lead to undefined behavior
    or incorrect results. This method should not be used in high-frequency loops without
    performance optimization due to its computational complexity.
