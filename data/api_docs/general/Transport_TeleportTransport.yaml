  brief: Moves a transport to a new location on the specified map
  description: The TeleportTransport method is responsible for relocating a transport
    object to a new position within the game world. This method handles the internal
    mechanics of updating the transport's coordinates and map ID, ensuring that passengers
    and associated game entities are properly managed during the transition. It is
    typically invoked when a transport needs to move between different zones or maps,
    such as when a ship sails to a new location or a zeppelin flies to a different
    destination. The method performs validation checks on the provided coordinates
    and map ID before executing the teleportation.
  parameters:
  - name: oldMapId
    description: The map identifier of the transport's current location. This value
      is used for validation purposes to ensure the transport is being moved from
      a valid map.
  - name: newMapId
    description: The map identifier of the destination where the transport should
      be moved. Must represent a valid map in the game world.
  - name: x
    description: The X coordinate of the new transport position in world space.
  - name: y
    description: The Y coordinate of the new transport position in world space.
  - name: z
    description: The Z coordinate of the new transport position in world space.
  - name: o
    description: The orientation (heading) of the transport in radians. This determines
      the direction the transport is facing after teleportation.
  returns: Returns true if the teleportation was successful and all validation checks
    passed; otherwise returns false if any parameter was invalid or the operation
    failed.
  examples:

    code: "Transport* transport = ...;\nbool success = transport->TeleportTransport(1,\
      \ 2, 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f, 1.57f);\nif (success) {\n    // Transport successfully\
      \ teleported\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Transport Teleport with Error Handling
    code: "Transport* transport = ...;\nint oldMap = transport->GetMapId();\nfloat\
      \ x = 500.0f, y = 600.0f, z = 700.0f, o = 3.14f;\n\nif (transport->TeleportTransport(oldMap,\
      \ 3, x, y, z, o)) {\n    // Handle successful teleportation\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Transport teleported successfully to map 3\");\n} else {\n    // Handle failure\n\
      \    sLog->outError(\"Failed to teleport transport to map 3\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used internally by the game engine during world
    updates and transport movement logic. It does not directly handle passenger movement
    or notify clients of the change; that is typically handled through other systems.
    The method assumes valid parameters and performs minimal validation, so callers
    should ensure coordinates are within acceptable bounds before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid map IDs or out-of-bounds coordinates
    may result in undefined behavior or client desynchronization. It should only be
    called from trusted code paths, such as during server-side transport movement
    logic or administrative commands. Avoid calling this method while the transport
    is actively carrying passengers without proper handling of passenger state.
