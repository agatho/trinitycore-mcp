  class: FormationManager
  method: SetFormationPriority
  signature: void FormationManager::SetFormationPriority(uint32 priority)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the priority level for formation management.
  description: The SetFormationPriority method configures the priority value used
    by the FormationManager to determine the order in which formations are processed.
    This priority affects how units within a formation interact with each other and
    how the formation behaves during dynamic changes such as unit movement or combat
    engagement. The method does not validate the input priority value, so it's up
    to the caller to ensure that the provided value is within an acceptable range
    for the game's internal systems.
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: The priority level to assign to the formation manager. Higher values
      typically indicate higher priority in processing order.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Formation Priority to High
    code: 'FormationManager* fm = ...;

      fm->SetFormationPriority(100);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Adjusting Formation Priority Based on Unit Type
    code: "FormationManager* fm = ...;\nif (unit->GetTypeId() == TYPEID_PLAYER)\n\
      \    fm->SetFormationPriority(50);\nelse\n    fm->SetFormationPriority(25);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies an internal state variable of the FormationManager.
    It is recommended to call this method before any formation-related operations
    to ensure consistent behavior. The priority value may influence performance in
    large-scale formations, as higher priority units are processed first.
