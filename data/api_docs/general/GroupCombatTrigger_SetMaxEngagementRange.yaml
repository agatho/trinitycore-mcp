  class: GroupCombatTrigger
  method: SetMaxEngagementRange
  signature: void GroupCombatTrigger::SetMaxEngagementRange(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the maximum engagement range for group combat triggers.
  description: The SetMaxEngagementRange method configures the maximum distance at
    which group combat triggers will engage enemies. This parameter defines how far
    away from the group's initial position a trigger can activate when an enemy enters
    its detection range. The value is typically specified in yards and affects the
    behavior of AI-controlled group members during combat scenarios. This setting
    is crucial for defining the tactical boundaries of group-based combat behaviors
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore environment.
  parameters:
  - name: range
    description: The maximum engagement distance in yards. Valid values are positive
      floating-point numbers representing distance units. Typical values range from
      5.0 to 50.0 yards depending on the group's combat strategy.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* trigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      trigger->SetMaxEngagementRange(25.0f);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Range for Different Combat Scenarios
    code: 'GroupCombatTrigger* rangedTrigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      rangedTrigger->SetMaxEngagementRange(40.0f); // For ranged units

      GroupCombatTrigger* meleeTrigger = new GroupCombatTrigger();

      meleeTrigger->SetMaxEngagementRange(10.0f); // For melee units'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly influences the AI behavior of group combat triggers
    and should be called before the trigger becomes active in combat scenarios. The
    range value affects performance as larger ranges require more frequent distance
    calculations between group members and potential targets.
  warnings: Setting extremely large engagement ranges may cause performance degradation
    due to increased computational overhead for distance checks. Ensure that the range
    values are appropriate for the intended combat mechanics and do not exceed reasonable
    limits for gameplay balance.
