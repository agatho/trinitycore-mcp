  class: Unit
  method: SetWalk
  signature: bool Unit::SetWalk(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables walking mode for the unit.
  description: The SetWalk method controls whether a unit can walk or runs. When enabled,
    the unit will move at walking speed instead of running speed. This method affects
    movement behavior and is commonly used in scenarios where specific movement speeds
    are required for gameplay mechanics. The method returns true if the operation
    was successful, false otherwise.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the walk mode was successfully set, false if the operation
    failed or was not applicable.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Unit* unit = player->GetSelectedUnit();\nbool success = unit->SetWalk(true);\n\
      if (success) {\n    // Unit is now walking\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may not be available for all unit types, particularly non-player
    units. Implementation depends on the underlying movement system and may require
    synchronization with other movement-related methods.
  warnings: Setting walk mode may interfere with other movement commands like SetRun
    or SetSpeed. Care should be taken when using this in conjunction with other movement
    control methods to avoid conflicts.
