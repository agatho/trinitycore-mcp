api:
  class: InteractionManager
  method: UseFlight
  signature: InteractionResult InteractionManager::UseFlight(Player * bot, Creature
    * flightMaster, uint32 destinationNode)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates flight path usage for a bot player with a specified destination
    node.
  description: The UseFlight method handles the process of initiating a flight path
    for a bot player using a flight master NPC. It manages the interaction between
    the player and the flight master to select and begin travel along a specific flight
    path node. The method ensures proper validation of the flight master's availability
    and the destination node's validity before proceeding with the flight initiation.
    This functionality is crucial for automated bot navigation in World of Warcraft
    environments where players need to traverse large distances efficiently.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will initiate
      the flight path.
  - name: flightMaster
    description: Pointer to the Creature object representing the flight master NPC
      that provides flight services.
  - name: destinationNode
    description: Unique identifier for the destination node on the flight path. This
      value determines which specific waypoint the bot will travel to.
  returns: Returns an InteractionResult enum indicating the success or failure of
    the flight initiation process. Possible values include SUCCESS, FAILED, INVALID_TARGET,
    or other interaction-specific results that reflect whether the flight was successfully
    started or encountered an error.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Flight Initiation
    code: "InteractionResult result = interactionManager.UseFlight(botPlayer, flightMasterNPC,\
      \ 12345);\nif (result == InteractionResult::SUCCESS) {\n    // Flight initiated\
      \ successfully\n    LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Bot {} started flight to node {}\"\
      , botPlayer->GetName(), 12345);\n} else {\n    // Handle flight initiation failure\n\
      \    LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Failed to initiate flight for bot {}\", botPlayer->GetName());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Flight Initiation with Error Handling
    code: "InteractionResult result = interactionManager.UseFlight(bot, flightMaster,\
      \ destination);\nswitch (result) {\n    case InteractionResult::SUCCESS:\n \
      \       LOG_INFO(\"world\", \"Flight initiated successfully\");\n        break;\n\
      \    case InteractionResult::INVALID_TARGET:\n        LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"\
      Invalid destination node {} for flight path\", destination);\n        break;\n\
      \    case InteractionResult::FAILED:\n        LOG_ERROR(\"world\", \"Failed\
      \ to initiate flight for bot {}\");\n        break;\n    default:\n        LOG_WARN(\"\
      world\", \"Unexpected result from UseFlight: {}\", static_cast<int>(result));\n\
      \        break;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot player has already been validated and is
    in a state where flight paths can be initiated. The destinationNode parameter
    should correspond to a valid node within the flight master's available path. The
    implementation may involve checking player faction, flight path access permissions,
    and whether the bot has sufficient resources (such as money or flight path knowledge)
    to initiate the requested flight.
  warnings: Ensure that the flightMaster parameter is actually a valid flight master
    NPC before calling this method, otherwise undefined behavior may occur. The destinationNode
    must be within the valid range of nodes for the specific flight master; otherwise,
    the method will likely return an error result. This method should not be called
    during active combat or while the player is in an invalid state that prevents
    movement.
