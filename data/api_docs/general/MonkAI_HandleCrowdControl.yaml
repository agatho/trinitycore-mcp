  signature: void MonkAI::HandleCrowdControl()
documentation:
  brief: Handles crowd control effects for the Monk AI, applying appropriate mechanics
    and state changes.
  description: The HandleCrowdControl method manages how a Monk AI character responds
    to crowd control effects such as stuns, fears, silences, and other disabling abilities.
    This method typically evaluates the current state of the AI, determines whether
    it is under a crowd control effect, and applies necessary behavior modifications
    including interrupting spells, changing movement patterns, or entering a stunned
    state. It is part of the core AI system that ensures proper reaction to game mechanics
    affecting player and NPC behavior during combat. The method may also trigger specific
    animations or visual effects associated with being under crowd control.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MonkAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n   \
      \ HandleCrowdControl();\n    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during AI updates to ensure timely
    response to crowd control effects. It's recommended to check for existing crowd
    control status before invoking this method to prevent redundant processing.
  warnings: Improper handling of crowd control states may lead to unexpected behavior
    such as spell interruption failures or incorrect movement patterns. Ensure that
    all crowd control effects are properly tracked and cleared when they expire.
