documentation:
  brief: Sets the owner effect mask for an aura creation info object
  description: The SetOwnerEffectMask method configures the effect mask that determines
    which effects are applied to the aura's owner. This is used internally by the
    TrinityCore framework to control how auras interact with their targets and owners,
    particularly in relation to spell effects and their application logic. The method
    returns a reference to the same AuraCreateInfo object, enabling method chaining
    for fluent interface patterns.
  parameters:
  - name: effMask
    description: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing the effect mask. Each bit
      corresponds to a specific spell effect, allowing fine-grained control over which
      effects are active or inactive for the aura.
  returns: Returns a reference to the AuraCreateInfo object, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AuraCreateInfo createInfo;

      createInfo.SetOwnerEffectMask(0x00000001); // Enable first effect'
    language: cpp
  - title: Fluent Interface Pattern
    code: "AuraCreateInfo createInfo;\ncreateInfo.SetOwnerEffectMask(0x0000000F)\n\
      \            .SetDuration(30000)\n            .SetMaxStacks(5); // Chaining\
      \ multiple methods"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during aura initialization and should be called
    before the aura is applied to a unit. The effect mask values are usually defined
    by spell effect constants in the TrinityCore codebase.
