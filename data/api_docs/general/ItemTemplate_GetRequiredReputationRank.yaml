  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetRequiredReputationRank() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the required reputation rank to purchase or use the item.
  description: The GetRequiredReputationRank method retrieves the minimum reputation
    rank required for a player to be able to buy or use the item. This value corresponds
    to one of the standard reputation levels (Hated, Hostile, Unfriendly, Neutral,
    Friendly, Honored, Revered, Exalted) defined in the game's reputation system.
    If the returned value is zero, it indicates that no specific reputation requirement
    exists for the item. This method is commonly used in item purchase validation
    and can influence whether an item appears in a vendor's inventory or is accessible
    to players based on their faction standing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the required reputation rank level. Valid values
    are typically 0 (no requirement) through 8 (Exalted), where each number corresponds
    to a specific reputation standing in the game's faction system.
  examples:
  - title: Check Item Reputation Requirement
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate)\n\
      {\n    uint32 requiredRank = itemTemplate->GetRequiredReputationRank();\n  \
      \  if (requiredRank > 0)\n        printf(\"This item requires at least %u reputation\
      \ rank to use.\\n\", requiredRank);\n    else\n        printf(\"No reputation\
      \ requirement for this item.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly accesses the internal data member that stores the required
    reputation rank for an item template. It is a simple getter function and should
    be fast to execute. The returned value is typically set during database loading
    or item creation and does not change at runtime.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a raw reputation rank value, which may
    not directly map to a player's current standing. You must compare this against
    the player's actual faction standings using methods like Player::GetReputationRank()
    to determine if they meet the requirement.
