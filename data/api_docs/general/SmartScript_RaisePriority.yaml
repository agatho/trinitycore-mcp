  signature: void SmartScript::RaisePriority(SmartScriptHolder & e)
documentation:
  brief: Increases the execution priority of a SmartScript event handler.
  description: The RaisePriority method is used to elevate the execution priority
    of a specific SmartScript event handler within the AI system. This ensures that
    the associated event will be processed before other events with lower priority,
    allowing for more critical actions to take precedence in the script execution
    order. The method modifies the internal priority value of the provided SmartScriptHolder
    object, which affects how the AI system schedules and executes scripted behaviors.
    This is particularly useful when certain events need to be handled immediately,
    such as interrupting ongoing actions or responding to high-priority stimuli like
    incoming attacks or player interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: e
    description: Reference to a SmartScriptHolder object representing the event handler
      whose priority should be increased. This parameter must point to a valid SmartScriptHolder
      that has been properly initialized and registered with the SmartScript system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Raising Priority for Aggro Event
    code: "void OnAggro(Unit* target)\n{\n    // Raise priority of this aggro event\
      \ handler\n    m_SmartScript->RaisePriority(m_AggroEvent);\n    // Continue\
      \ with normal aggro handling\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Prioritizing Critical Combat Response
    code: "void HandleCombatEvent()\n{\n    // When player attacks, immediately raise\
      \ priority of defensive actions\n    if (player->IsAttacking())\n    {\n   \
      \     SmartScriptHolder* criticalEvent = GetCriticalDefenseEvent();\n      \
      \  m_SmartScript->RaisePriority(*criticalEvent);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies the internal priority state of the SmartScriptHolder,
    which directly affects execution order. The SmartScript system uses this priority
    to determine which events should be processed first during each AI cycle. Be cautious
    when raising priorities frequently as it may affect overall performance if overused.
  warnings: Calling RaisePriority on an unregistered or invalid SmartScriptHolder
    can lead to undefined behavior. Always ensure the SmartScriptHolder is properly
    initialized and registered before calling this method. Excessive use of priority
    raising may cause performance degradation due to frequent reordering of event
    processing.
