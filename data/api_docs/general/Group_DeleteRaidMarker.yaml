  method: DeleteRaidMarker
  signature: void Group::DeleteRaidMarker(int markerId)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a raid marker from the group's marker list by its ID.
  description: The DeleteRaidMarker method removes a specific raid marker from the
    group's collection of markers based on the provided marker ID. This functionality
    is typically used in World of Warcraft's raid management system to clear or update
    markers placed by players during group encounters. The method operates on the
    group's internal marker data structure and does not directly interact with the
    client-side display, which is handled separately through network packets. It is
    commonly called when a player removes their own marker or when a group leader
    wants to reset all markers in preparation for a new encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: markerId
    description: The unique identifier of the raid marker to be deleted. This value
      corresponds to the marker ID assigned when the marker was originally created
      using methods like AddRaidMarker or similar group marker functions.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Delete a specific raid marker by ID
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    group->DeleteRaidMarker(3);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the marker ID passed exists within the group's current
    markers. If an invalid or non-existent marker ID is provided, the behavior may
    be undefined or silently ignored depending on implementation details. The operation
    is typically performed on the server-side and does not directly affect client
    visuals without proper synchronization.
  warnings: Ensure that the marker ID corresponds to a valid existing marker before
    calling this method. Attempting to delete a non-existent marker may result in
    unexpected behavior or errors in the group's internal state management.
