  signature: void GameObject::InheritStringIds(const GameObject * parent)
documentation:
  brief: InheritStringIds copies string identifiers from a parent GameObject to this
    GameObject instance.
  description: This method is used to transfer string identifiers from a parent GameObject
    object to the current GameObject instance. It typically occurs during object initialization
    or when creating child objects that need to inherit certain properties from their
    parent. The method ensures that all relevant string identifiers are properly propagated,
    maintaining consistency in game object identification and behavior. This functionality
    is essential for proper object hierarchy management within TrinityCore's GameObject
    system.

  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'GameObject* parent = new GameObject();

      GameObject* child = new GameObject();

      child->InheritStringIds(parent);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called during object initialization or when creating
    child objects. It is important to ensure that the parent GameObject has already
    been initialized before calling this method, as it may cause issues if string
    identifiers are not yet set.
  warnings: Calling this method without properly initializing the parent GameObject
    can lead to undefined behavior or missing identifiers in the child GameObject.
    Ensure proper object hierarchy when using this method.
