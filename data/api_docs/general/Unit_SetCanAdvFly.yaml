  brief: Sets whether the unit can advance fly or not.
  description: This method controls the ability of a Unit to perform advanced flying
    movement, which is typically used for flight paths or special movement mechanics
    in World of Warcraft. It enables or disables the capability for the unit to fly
    in advanced modes, affecting how the unit moves through the game world. The method
    returns true if the operation was successful and false otherwise, indicating that
    the unit's flying status has been updated accordingly.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit's flying status was successfully set, false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* unit = new Unit;\nbool result = unit->SetCanAdvFly(true);\nif (result)\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Unit can now advance fly\" << std::endl;"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other movement-related
    methods to control the behavior of units during flight paths or special movement
    scenarios. Implementation details may vary depending on how the unit's movement
    state is handled internally.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly without proper context, as it
    might affect the unit's movement state and could lead to unexpected behavior if
    used incorrectly.
