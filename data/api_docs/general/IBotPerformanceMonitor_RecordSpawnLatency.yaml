  class: IBotPerformanceMonitor
  method: RecordSpawnLatency
  signature: void IBotPerformanceMonitor::RecordSpawnLatency(uint64 microseconds)
documentation:
  brief: Records the latency of a bot spawn event in microseconds for performance
    monitoring.
  description: The RecordSpawnLatency method is used to log the time taken to spawn
    a bot, measured in microseconds. This method is typically invoked by the bot management
    system or performance monitoring subsystem when a new bot instance is created.
    It allows developers and administrators to track spawn times and identify potential
    bottlenecks in bot instantiation processes. The recorded data can be used for
    profiling, optimization, and ensuring that bot spawning does not introduce significant
    delays to game performance. This method does not return any value and is designed
    to be called as part of a performance monitoring workflow.
  parameters:
  - name: microseconds
    description: The time taken to spawn the bot, measured in microseconds. This value
      should be a positive integer representing the duration of the spawn operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IBotPerformanceMonitor* monitor = GetBotPerformanceMonitor();

      uint64 spawnTime = 1500; // 1.5 milliseconds

      monitor->RecordSpawnLatency(spawnTime);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Bot Creation Logic
    code: "void CreateNewBot()\n{\n    auto startTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    // ... bot creation logic ...\n    auto endTime = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\
      \    auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(endTime\
      \ - startTime).count();\n    GetBotPerformanceMonitor()->RecordSpawnLatency(static_cast<uint64>(duration));\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a performance monitoring interface and should be called
    from within the bot creation or spawning context. It's recommended to use high-resolution
    timing mechanisms to ensure accurate microsecond measurements. The method itself
    does not perform any validation on the input value, so callers should ensure that
    the microseconds parameter represents a valid duration.
  warnings: Ensure that this method is not called excessively in performance-critical
    code paths as it may introduce overhead. Also, be aware that recording very small
    spawn times (e.g., below 1 microsecond) might not be meaningful due to measurement
    precision limitations of timing functions.
