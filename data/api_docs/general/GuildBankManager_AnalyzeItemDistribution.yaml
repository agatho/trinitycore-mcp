api:
  class: GuildBankManager
  method: AnalyzeItemDistribution
  signature: void GuildBankManager::AnalyzeItemDistribution(int * guild, BankAnalysis
    & analysis)
documentation:
  brief: Analyzes the distribution of items within a guild's bank and populates the
    provided analysis structure with detailed statistics.
  description: The AnalyzeItemDistribution method performs a comprehensive examination
    of all items stored in a guild's bank, calculating various metrics such as item
    counts, rarity distributions, and usage patterns. This method is typically used
    for administrative purposes, reporting, or balancing gameplay mechanics within
    the guild management system. It processes the entire guild bank inventory and
    updates the provided BankAnalysis object with detailed breakdowns of item types,
    quantities, and other relevant statistics. The method does not modify any existing
    data but rather provides a read-only analysis of the current state of the guild's
    bank contents.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier. This parameter
      specifies which guild's bank inventory should be analyzed.
  - name: analysis
    description: Reference to a BankAnalysis object that will be populated with the
      results of the item distribution analysis. The object contains fields for storing
      item counts, rarity statistics, and other relevant metrics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Item Distribution Analysis
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      BankAnalysis analysis;

      GuildBankManager::AnalyzeItemDistribution(&guildId, analysis);

      // analysis now contains detailed statistics about the guild''s bank items'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Analysis Results for Reporting
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      BankAnalysis analysis;

      GuildBankManager::AnalyzeItemDistribution(&guildId, analysis);


      std::cout << "Total Items: " << analysis.totalItems << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Rare Items: " << analysis.rareItemCount << std::endl;

      std::cout << "Epic Items: " << analysis.epicItemCount << std::endl;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a full scan of the guild bank inventory, which may have
    performance implications for large guilds with extensive item collections. The
    BankAnalysis object should be properly initialized before calling this method
    to avoid undefined behavior. This method is typically called internally by the
    guild management system or through administrative commands.
  warnings: Ensure that the guild parameter points to a valid guild identifier; otherwise,
    the behavior is undefined. Do not modify the BankAnalysis object after passing
    it to this method as it may lead to inconsistent results. This method should not
    be called during high-frequency operations due to its potential performance impact
    on large datasets.
