  signature: int32 ArenaTeam::GetMatchmakerRatingMod(uint32 ownRating, uint32 opponentRating,
    bool won)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the matchmaker rating modifier based on player and
    opponent ratings and match outcome.
  description: The GetMatchmakerRatingMod method computes the adjustment to a player's
    matchmaker rating following a match. This calculation is used in the Arena system
    to determine how much a player's rating should increase or decrease depending
    on their own rating, their opponent's rating, and whether they won or lost the
    match. The method implements the standard Elo-based rating adjustment algorithm
    adjusted for World of Warcraft's arena mechanics. It takes into account the relative
    strength difference between players and applies appropriate modifiers to ensure
    balanced matchmaking and fair rating changes.
  parameters:
  - name: ownRating
    description: The player's current matchmaker rating before the match
  - name: opponentRating
    description: The opponent's current matchmaker rating before the match
  - name: won
    description: Boolean flag indicating if the player won (true) or lost (false)
      the match
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the change in matchmaker rating.
    Positive values indicate rating increase, negative values indicate rating decrease.
    The exact magnitude depends on the rating difference and match outcome.
  examples:
  - title: Calculate rating change for a win
    code: 'int32 ratingChange = arenaTeam->GetMatchmakerRatingMod(1500, 1600, true);

      // Returns positive value indicating rating increase for winning against higher-rated
      opponent'
    language: cpp
  - title: Calculate rating change for a loss
    code: 'int32 ratingChange = arenaTeam->GetMatchmakerRatingMod(1800, 1700, false);

      // Returns negative value indicating rating decrease for losing against lower-rated
      opponent'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is integral to the arena matchmaking system and directly affects
    player ranking. The implementation uses a standard Elo algorithm with adjustments
    specific to WoW's competitive balance requirements. The method should only be
    called after match results are finalized and all necessary rating calculations
    are complete.
  warnings: Ensure that both ownRating and opponentRating are valid positive integers
    before calling this method. Calling with invalid ratings may result in incorrect
    rating adjustments or unexpected behavior in the matchmaking system.
