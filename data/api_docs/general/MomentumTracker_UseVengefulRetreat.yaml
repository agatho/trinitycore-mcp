documentation:
  brief: Executes the Vengeful Retreat ability, applying its effects to the player
    and resetting momentum state.
  description: The UseVengefulRetreat method activates the Vengeful Retreat ability
    within the MomentumTracker system. This ability typically provides a temporary
    buff or debuff that influences player movement, damage output, or threat generation.
    The method handles the internal logic for applying these effects and ensures the
    momentum tracker's state is properly updated to reflect the usage of this ability.
    It may also trigger related cooldowns or reset other momentum-related mechanics.
    The method does not require any parameters as it operates on the current player
    state managed by the MomentumTracker instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage

      tracker->UseVengefulRetreat();'

  notes: This method should only be called when the player has the Vengeful Retreat
    ability available and is in a valid state to use it. The MomentumTracker instance
    must be properly initialized before calling this method.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying ability availability or player state
    may lead to unexpected behavior or game logic errors. Ensure proper cooldown checks
    are performed before invoking this method.
