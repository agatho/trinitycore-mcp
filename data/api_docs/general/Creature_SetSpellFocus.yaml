  signature: void Creature::SetSpellFocus(const int * focusSpell, const int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets spell focus for a creature to target specified spell.
  description: This method configures a creature's spell focus behavior by setting
    the focus spell and target spell. It allows creatures to properly handle spell
    casting and targeting mechanics during combat or non-combat situations. The method
    ensures that the creature's spell focus is correctly initialized with the specified
    parameters, enabling proper execution of spell-related actions in various game
    contexts.
  parameters:
  - name: focusSpell
    description: Pointer to the spell ID that defines the focus spell for this creature.
      This determines what spell the creature will use as its focus.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the target spell ID that defines the target spell for
      this creature. This determines what spell the creature will target during its
      focus behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetSpellFocus(&focusSpell, &target);

      '
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      int focusSpellId = 12345;

      int targetId = 67890;

      creature->SetSpellFocus(&focusSpellId, &targetId);

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include that this method likely modifies internal
    creature state variables related to spell focus. Performance considerations involve
    ensuring proper memory management when using pointers. Thread safety depends on
    the specific implementation of the creature class and may require synchronization
    in multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: The method requires careful handling of pointer values as invalid pointers
    can lead to memory access violations or undefined behavior. Common mistakes include
    passing null pointers or incorrect spell IDs that don't exist in the database.
    Dangerous edge cases involve setting focus spells that are not valid for the creature's
    type or context.
