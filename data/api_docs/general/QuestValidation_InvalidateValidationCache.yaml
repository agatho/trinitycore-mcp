  class: QuestValidation
  method: InvalidateValidationCache
  signature: void QuestValidation::InvalidateValidationCache(uint32 botGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Invalidates the validation cache for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
  description: The InvalidateValidationCache method clears the cached validation data
    associated with a particular bot in the QuestValidation system. This ensures that
    subsequent quest validation checks will re-evaluate the bot's quest status rather
    than using potentially outdated cached results. The method is typically invoked
    when changes occur to a bot's quest progress or state that would invalidate previously
    cached validation outcomes. It operates on a per-bot basis, allowing for targeted
    cache invalidation without affecting other bots' validation states.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose validation cache should
      be invalidated. This value must correspond to a valid bot entity within the
      TrinityCore system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Invalidating Cache for a Specific Bot
    code: 'QuestValidation::InvalidateValidationCache(12345);

      // This call invalidates the validation cache for the bot with GUID 12345.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause race conditions
    when called concurrently. It is recommended to call this method whenever a bot's
    quest state changes significantly, such as after completing or failing a quest,
    to ensure accurate validation results.
