  method: GetVehicle
  signature: Vehicle * Unit::GetVehicle() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the vehicle object associated with this unit, if any.
  description: The GetVehicle method retrieves the Vehicle object that is currently
    attached to the unit. This method is commonly used in the context of player or
    creature units that are mounted on vehicles. The returned vehicle object represents
    the vehicle the unit is currently seated on, or null if no vehicle is active.
    This method is essential for determining vehicle-related gameplay mechanics such
    as vehicle seat positions, passenger interactions, and vehicle-specific behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Vehicle object associated with this unit, or nullptr
    if no vehicle is currently active. The returned value may be null when the unit
    is not mounted on any vehicle.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Vehicle Retrieval
    code: "Vehicle* vehicle = unit->GetVehicle();\nif (vehicle)\n{\n    // Unit is\
      \ mounted on a vehicle\n    // Do something with vehicle\n}\nelse\n{\n    //\
      \ Unit is not mounted on any vehicle\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may return nullptr if the unit
    is not currently seated on a vehicle. It is recommended to check whether the unit
    has an active vehicle before using this method in gameplay logic.
  warnings: Avoid calling this method on units that are not mounted on vehicles, as
    it may lead to undefined behavior or null pointer dereferences. Always verify
    that the unit is actually mounted on a vehicle before using this method.
