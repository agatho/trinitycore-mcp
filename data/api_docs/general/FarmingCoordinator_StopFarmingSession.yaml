api:
  class: FarmingCoordinator
  method: StopFarmingSession
  signature: void FarmingCoordinator::StopFarmingSession(int * player)
documentation:
  brief: Stops the active farming session for the specified player.
  description: The StopFarmingSession method terminates an ongoing farming session
    associated with a given player. This method is typically invoked when a player
    exits a farming area, logs out, or when the session timer expires. It ensures
    that any active farming activities are properly concluded and resources are released.
    The method may also trigger cleanup operations such as saving player progress,
    updating quest states, or notifying other systems about the end of the farming
    session. This functionality is crucial for maintaining game state consistency
    in World of Warcraft's farming mechanics.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter specifies which player's farming session should be stopped.
      The value must be a valid player GUID or NULL, where NULL indicates that no
      specific player is targeted.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      int playerId = 12345;

      coordinator.StopFarmingSession(&playerId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Stopping Session for NULL Player
    code: 'FarmingCoordinator coordinator;

      int* nullPlayer = nullptr;

      coordinator.StopFarmingSession(nullPlayer);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be thread-safe and should not cause race conditions
    when called from different threads. It assumes that the player GUID passed in
    is valid and corresponds to an active farming session.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or uninitialized player GUID may lead
    to undefined behavior. Ensure that the player pointer points to a valid player
    object before invoking this method.
