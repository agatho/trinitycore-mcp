documentation:
  brief: Initializes self-resurrection spells for the player, setting up their ability
    to resurrect themselves using available spell mechanics.
  description: The InitializeSelfResurrectionSpells method prepares a player character's
    spellbook and abilities related to self-resurrection. This includes registering
    and enabling any applicable resurrection spells such as 'Self Resurrection' or
    similar mechanics that allow players to revive themselves after death. The method
    is typically invoked during player initialization or when specific conditions
    are met, ensuring that the player has access to their own resurrection capabilities
    within the game's mechanics. It handles internal setup of spell states and cooldowns
    related to self-resurrection abilities.

      player->InitializeSelfResurrectionSpells();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    player login or spell system initialization. Developers should not typically call
    this directly unless implementing custom resurrection mechanics or debugging spell
    behavior.
