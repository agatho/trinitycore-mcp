  class: MageAI

  signature: bool MageAI::IsSpellInstant(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell is instant-cast.
  description: The IsSpellInstant method checks if a given spell ID corresponds to
    an instant-cast spell in the MageAI system. This utility function is used by the
    mage's AI behavior to make decisions about spell casting, particularly when determining
    whether a spell can be cast immediately without any channeling or casting time.
    The method evaluates the spell properties and returns true if the spell is classified
    as instant-cast, false otherwise. This functionality is crucial for optimizing
    spell selection and execution timing in the AI's decision-making process.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell is an instant-cast spell, false if
    it has a casting time or channeling duration.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Fireball is Instant Cast
    code: "if (mageAI->IsSpellInstant(133)) {\n    // Fireball is instant cast, proceed\
      \ with immediate casting\n    mageAI->CastSpell(133);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Spell Selection Based on Cast Time
    code: "uint32 bestSpell = 0;\nif (IsSpellInstant(1449)) {\n    bestSpell = 1449;\
      \ // Frostbolt is instant\n} else if (IsSpellInstant(133)) {\n    bestSpell\
      \ = 133;  // Fireball is instant\n}\nif (bestSpell) {\n    mageAI->CastSpell(bestSpell);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell data tables or cached spell information.
    The implementation may involve checking against a predefined list of instant-cast
    spells or querying spell properties from the game's spell database. Performance
    is generally good as it's a simple lookup operation, but repeated calls should
    be considered in performance-critical sections.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method is valid and corresponds
    to an actual spell in the game database. Invalid spell IDs may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect return values. This function should not be used for spells
    that are not part of the Mage's spellbook.
