documentation:
  brief: Removes all auras from the unit that have been marked for deletion.
  description: The _DeleteRemovedAuras method is an internal utility function responsible
    for cleaning up auras that have been flagged for removal from the unit. This typically
    occurs during the update cycle when aura states are processed and certain auras
    are no longer valid or have expired. The method iterates through the unit's aura
    list, identifies auras marked for deletion, and removes them from the unit's aura
    application. It is generally called as part of the unit's update process to maintain
    clean aura state and prevent memory leaks from lingering auras. This function
    does not directly modify aura data structures but rather handles the cleanup of
    auras that are already marked for removal.

  - title: Internal cleanup during unit update
    code: "void Unit::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n\
      \    _DeleteRemovedAuras();\n    // ... continue with other updates ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by external
    code. It's typically invoked as part of the unit's regular update cycle. The method
    assumes that auras marked for deletion have already been properly flagged through
    other internal mechanisms such as Aura::Remove or similar cleanup procedures.
