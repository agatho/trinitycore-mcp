  brief: Initializes and loads the character cache storage from the database
  description: The LoadCharacterCacheStorage method is responsible for populating
    the in-memory character cache with data retrieved from the database. This method
    is typically called during server startup or when the cache needs to be refreshed.
    It ensures that all character-related information such as names, GUIDs, and basic
    account details are available in memory for fast access. The method performs database
    queries to fetch character data and stores it in internal caches for efficient
    retrieval during gameplay operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    cache invalidation is required. It's a blocking operation that may take some time
    depending on the number of characters in the database.
