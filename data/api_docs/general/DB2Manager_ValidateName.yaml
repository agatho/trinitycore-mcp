  method: ValidateName
  signature: int DB2Manager::ValidateName(const std::wstring & name, LocaleConstant
    locale) const
documentation:
  brief: Validates a database table name against known DB2 file formats and locale-specific
    constraints.
  description: The ValidateName method checks whether a given wide string name conforms
    to the expected naming conventions for DB2 (Database 2) files used in TrinityCore.
    It ensures that the provided name is valid for the specified locale, which may
    include checking for proper encoding, length limits, and adherence to internal
    naming rules. This validation is typically performed before attempting to load
    or reference a DB2 file by its name. The method returns an integer code indicating
    success or failure of the validation process.
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: A wide string representing the name of the DB2 file to validate.
      This should correspond to a valid DB2 table identifier used within the TrinityCore
      database system.
  - name: locale
    description: The LocaleConstant value specifying the locale context for validation.
      This determines how certain character sets or naming rules are interpreted during
      validation.
  returns: 'An integer code indicating the result of the validation: 0 if successful,
    negative values for various error conditions such as invalid format, unsupported
    locale, or name length violations.'
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of ValidateName
    code: "std::wstring tableName = L\"Achievement\";\nLocaleConstant loc = LOCALE_en;\n\
      int result = sDB2Manager->ValidateName(tableName, loc);\nif (result == 0) {\n\
      \    // Name is valid\n} else {\n    // Handle validation failure\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs checks based on internal DB2 file naming conventions
    and locale-specific character set requirements. It's part of the database management
    layer in TrinityCore, ensuring consistency across different locales and preventing
    access to invalid or malformed DB2 files.
  warnings: Ensure that the provided name is a valid wide string and that the locale
    constant corresponds to an initialized locale within the system. Incorrect usage
    may lead to silent failures or assertion errors during DB2 file loading.
