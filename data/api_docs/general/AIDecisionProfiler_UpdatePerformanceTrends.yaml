documentation:
  brief: Updates performance trends for AI decision-making by analyzing recent decision
    latencies and resource usage.
  description: The UpdatePerformanceTrends method collects and processes timing data
    from recent AI decisions to identify performance patterns and bottlenecks. It
    analyzes decision execution times, memory consumption, and CPU utilization to
    maintain an internal profile of AI behavior. This method is typically called periodically
    by the AI system to ensure optimal performance tuning and to detect potential
    issues in AI decision-making processes. The collected data helps inform future
    optimizations and can be used for debugging or performance monitoring purposes.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.UpdatePerformanceTrends();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be called from within the AI subsystem's update
    loop. It may perform internal calculations that could impact performance if invoked
    too frequently without proper throttling. The profiling data is typically stored
    in internal buffers and may be reset or rotated based on configured thresholds.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from high-frequency update paths unless
    properly throttled, as it may cause performance degradation. The method assumes
    that AI decision timing data has already been recorded through other means.
