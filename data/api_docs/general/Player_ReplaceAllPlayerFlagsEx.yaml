  method: ReplaceAllPlayerFlagsEx
  signature: void Player::ReplaceAllPlayerFlagsEx(PlayerFlagsEx flags)
documentation:
  brief: Replaces all player flags with the specified PlayerFlagsEx value.
  description: This method replaces all existing player flags with the new PlayerFlagsEx
    value provided. It is used to update a player's flag status in the game world,
    typically for setting or resetting specific player states such as invisibility,
    ghost mode, or other special conditions. The method operates on the player's internal
    flag system and modifies the player's current flags state without affecting other
    player attributes or gameplay mechanics. This operation is commonly used during
    player initialization or when changing player states in response to game events.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting player flags to invisibility
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ReplaceAllPlayerFlagsEx(PlayerFlagsEx::PLAYER_FLAGS_INVISIBILITY);

      // Player now has invisibility flag set'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it directly modifies the player's
    internal flags state. It may affect gameplay mechanics related to visibility,
    ghost mode, or other flag-based behaviors. The implementation typically involves
    updating a bitmask within the player object and may require synchronization with
    server-side game state updates.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect player state behavior,
    such as unexpected visibility or ghost mode states. Avoid using this method during
    active gameplay sessions unless explicitly required by game mechanics. Also note
    that this method does not handle flag combinations or complex interactions between
    flags.
