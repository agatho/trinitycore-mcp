  class: CombatAIIntegrator
  method: Update
  signature: IntegrationResult CombatAIIntegrator::Update(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the combat AI integration state based on elapsed time.
  description: The Update method is responsible for processing and maintaining the
    state of the CombatAIIntegrator. It takes a time delta (diff) parameter which
    represents the milliseconds that have passed since the last update call. This
    method typically handles AI decision-making, action execution, and state transitions
    within the combat system. The integration result indicates whether the update
    was successful or if any special conditions occurred during processing. This method
    is commonly called from the main game loop or AI update systems to ensure real-time
    combat behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: IntegrationResult indicating the outcome of the update operation. Possible
    values may include SUCCESS, FAILED, or other status codes specific to the integration
    logic, representing whether the update completed normally or encountered issues
    during processing.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Update Call
    code: "void UpdateCombatAI()\n{\n    uint32 diff = sObjectMgr->GetLastTick();\n\
      \    IntegrationResult result = combatAIIntegrator.Update(diff);\n    if (result\
      \ == INTEGRATION_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        // Continue normal processing\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly with accurate time deltas to ensure
    proper AI behavior. The integration result should always be checked for error
    conditions, as the combat system may become unstable if updates fail repeatedly.
