  signature: void RogueAI::InitializeCombatSystems()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes all combat-related systems and states for the rogue AI.
  description: The InitializeCombatSystems method sets up and configures all necessary
    combat mechanics and state variables for a RogueAI instance. This includes initializing
    ability cooldowns, setting up threat management systems, configuring combat behavior
    flags, and preparing the AI's internal state machine for engagement with targets.
    The method ensures that the rogue AI is fully prepared to enter combat mode with
    proper resource management and tactical awareness. It should be called once during
    the AI initialization phase before any combat-related operations are performed.

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: 'RogueAI rogueAI;

      rogueAI.InitializeCombatSystems();

      // AI is now ready for combat engagement'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the AI's lifecycle. It assumes
    that the AI object has been properly constructed and that all necessary dependencies
    are available. The method does not perform any validation of the AI's internal
    state, so it should only be invoked when the AI is in a valid initialization state.
