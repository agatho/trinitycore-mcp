    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves real-time performance metrics for bot operations, returning timestamp
    and metric value pairs.
  description: The GetRealTimePerformance method collects and returns current performance
    data related to bot activities within the TrinityCore environment. This data is
    typically used for monitoring system load, identifying bottlenecks, or analyzing
    bot behavior over time. The returned vector contains pairs of timestamps (as uint32_t)
    and corresponding performance values (as double), allowing for detailed analysis
    of how bot systems are performing at any given moment. The method does not modify
    internal state and is safe to call from multiple threads concurrently.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector containing pairs of timestamp (uint32_t) and performance
    metric (double). Each pair represents a point in time and the associated measured
    performance value, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of bot system behavior.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<std::pair<uint32_t, double>>\
      \ performanceData = analytics.GetRealTimePerformance();\nfor (const auto& dataPoint\
      \ : performanceData) {\n    std::cout << \"Timestamp: \" << dataPoint.first\
      \ << \", Value: \" << dataPoint.second << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to provide instantaneous performance snapshots without
    blocking or modifying internal state. It may return empty results if no performance
    data has been collected yet, or if the analytics system is not currently active.
