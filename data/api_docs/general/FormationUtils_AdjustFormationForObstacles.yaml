    const int & obstacles)
documentation:
  brief: Adjusts formation positions to avoid obstacles in the game world
  description: The AdjustFormationForObstacles method calculates and returns an adjusted
    formation layout that avoids detected obstacles within the game environment. This
    utility is typically used by AI systems or group movement logic to ensure that
    units maintain their intended formation while navigating around environmental
    hazards, static objects, or dynamic blockers. The method takes into account the
    original formation positions and obstacle data to compute a new set of positions
    that preserve formation integrity where possible, with fallback behavior for unavoidable
    conflicts. It is commonly invoked during pathfinding or group movement updates
    in TrinityCore's AI framework.
  parameters:
  - name: originalPositions
    description: A reference to an integer representing the original formation position
      data, typically encoded as a bitmask or coordinate set indicating unit positions
      within the formation.
  - name: obstacles
    description: A reference to an integer containing obstacle data, likely representing
      spatial constraints or blockages in the game world that must be avoided during
      formation adjustment.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the adjusted formation positions
    after obstacle avoidance has been applied. A return value of 0 typically indicates
    no adjustments were needed, while non-zero values may represent modified position
    data or error codes if obstacles could not be properly resolved.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'int original = 0x1234;

      int obstacleData = 0x5678;

      int adjusted = FormationUtils::AdjustFormationForObstacles(original, obstacleData);

      // Adjusted formation data is now stored in ''adjusted''

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs spatial calculations and may involve collision
    detection logic. It assumes that both input parameters are valid and properly
    formatted for the internal algorithms. The exact encoding of positions and obstacles
    should be verified based on TrinityCore's specific AI implementation details.
  warnings: Improperly formatted input data could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect
    formation adjustments. Ensure that the originalPositions and obstacles parameters
    conform to expected formats before calling this method.
