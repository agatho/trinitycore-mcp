api:
  class: QuestCompletion
  method: SynchronizeGroupObjectives
  signature: void QuestCompletion::SynchronizeGroupObjectives(Group * group, uint32
    questId)
documentation:
  brief: Synchronizes quest objectives for all group members when a quest is completed.
  description: The SynchronizeGroupObjectives method ensures that all players within
    a specified group have their quest objective progress updated to match the current
    state of the given quest. This is typically called when a quest is completed by
    one member of the group, so that other group members' quest log and objective
    tracking are properly updated. The method iterates through all online group members
    and updates their individual quest progress for the specified quest ID. It's an
    essential part of maintaining consistent quest state across group members in shared
    quest scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing the players whose quest objectives
      need synchronization. Must be a valid group instance, cannot be null.
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest for which objectives should be
      synchronized. Must correspond to a valid quest in the game database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage when quest is completed by group member
    code: "Group* playerGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (playerGroup)\n{\n    QuestCompletion::SynchronizeGroupObjectives(playerGroup,\
      \ 12345);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in quest completion handler
    code: "void OnQuestComplete(Player* player, uint32 questId)\n{\n    Group* group\
      \ = player->GetGroup();\n    if (group && group->GetMembersCount() > 1)\n  \
      \  {\n        QuestCompletion::SynchronizeGroupObjectives(group, questId);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically by the core when a group quest
    is completed. It performs synchronization only for online players in the group
    and does not affect offline members. The method assumes that the quest data is
    already properly updated for the completing player before calling.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or null group pointer will result
    in undefined behavior. Ensure the group exists and contains valid players before
    invoking this method. Also, be cautious when calling this during quest completion
    events as it may cause recursion issues if not handled carefully.
