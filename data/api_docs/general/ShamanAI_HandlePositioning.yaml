  class: ShamanAI
  method: HandlePositioning
  signature: bool ShamanAI::HandlePositioning(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Determines if the shaman AI should reposition based on target and combat
    state
  description: The HandlePositioning method evaluates whether the shaman AI should
    adjust its positioning relative to the current target. It checks various conditions
    including target validity, distance thresholds, and combat state to decide if
    repositioning is necessary for optimal spell casting or melee engagement. The
    method typically returns true when positioning adjustments are required, false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for maintaining effective combat positioning
    in shaman AI behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target identifier. This parameter
      is used to determine if the current target requires positional adjustment.
  returns: Returns true if repositioning is needed based on target state and combat
    conditions, false otherwise. The method may return false when the target is invalid,
    out of range, or when positioning is not beneficial.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in shaman AI logic
    code: "if (shamanAI->HandlePositioning(&targetId)) {\n    // Execute repositioning\
      \ logic\n    shamanAI->Reposition();\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with combat state checking
    code: "int target = ai->GetTarget();\nif (target != 0 && shamanAI->HandlePositioning(&target))\
      \ {\n    if (ai->IsInCombat()) {\n        // Adjust positioning for optimal\
      \ spell casting\n        shamanAI->MoveToTarget(target);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core AI decision-making loop and should be called
    frequently during combat. The method relies on internal state tracking of target
    validity, distance calculations, and combat status to make positioning decisions.
  warnings: Ensure that the target parameter points to a valid target ID before calling
    this method. Passing an invalid or uninitialized target value may lead to unexpected
    behavior or crashes.
