  class: ScheduledAction
  method: ScheduledAction
  signature: void ScheduledAction::ScheduledAction(int guid, ScheduleEntry::Action
    act, int time, const std::string & pattern)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a scheduled action with GUID, action type, time, and pattern
    for execution.
  description: The ScheduledAction constructor initializes a scheduled action object
    with the provided parameters. It sets up the unique identifier (GUID) of the entity
    triggering the action, the specific action to be executed, the time at which it
    should occur, and an optional pattern string that may define additional context
    or conditions for the action. This method is typically used within the TrinityCore
    AI system to schedule events or actions for entities such as NPCs or players.
    The initialization ensures that all necessary data for later execution is properly
    stored in the object's internal state.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the entity associated with this scheduled
      action. Must be a valid integer representing an existing object in the game
      world.
  - name: act
    description: The type of action to be executed, defined by the ScheduleEntry::Action
      enumeration. This determines what specific behavior will be triggered at the
      scheduled time.
  - name: time
    description: The time value when this action should execute, typically represented
      in milliseconds or game ticks since a reference point.
  - name: pattern
    description: An optional string pattern that may contain additional context or
      parameters for the scheduled action. Can be empty if no extra information is
      needed.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Scheduled Action Initialization
    code: ScheduledAction action(12345, ScheduleEntry::ACTION_CAST_SPELL, 5000, "target=player");
    language: cpp
  - title: Initializing a Scheduled Action with No Pattern
    code: ScheduledAction action(67890, ScheduleEntry::ACTION_MOVE_TO_POSITION, 10000,
      "");
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any validation on the input parameters.
    It is expected that callers ensure valid GUIDs and action types are passed in.
    The pattern string can be used to store serialized data or configuration information
    for complex actions.
