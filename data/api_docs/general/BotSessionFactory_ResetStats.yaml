documentation:
  brief: Resets all bot session statistics to their default values.
  description: The ResetStats method clears and reinitializes all accumulated statistics
    within the BotSessionFactory. This includes resetting counters, timers, and performance
    metrics associated with bot sessions. The method is typically invoked when a new
    batch of bots needs to be initialized or when existing bot data should be cleared
    to prevent carryover effects between different testing or operational scenarios.
    It ensures that subsequent bot operations start with clean state information.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Resetting Bot Session Statistics
    code: 'BotSessionFactory::Instance()->ResetStats();

      // All session statistics are now reset to initial values'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called carefully as it will invalidate any existing
    statistical data that may be used for monitoring or reporting purposes. It is
    recommended to call this before starting a new set of bot operations to ensure
    accurate tracking.
  warnings: Calling ResetStats while active bot sessions are running might lead to
    inconsistent state handling if not properly synchronized with session lifecycle
    management.
