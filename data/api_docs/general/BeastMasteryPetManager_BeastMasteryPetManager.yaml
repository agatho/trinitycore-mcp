  class: BeastMasteryPetManager
  method: BeastMasteryPetManager
  signature: void BeastMasteryPetManager::BeastMasteryPetManager(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new BeastMasteryPetManager instance for the specified player
    bot.
  description: The BeastMasteryPetManager constructor initializes internal state and
    data structures required for managing beast mastery pets associated with a player
    bot. This method sets up necessary references to the player object, configures
    pet-related variables, and prepares the manager to handle beast mastery pet behaviors,
    abilities, and interactions within the TrinityCore framework. The initialization
    process ensures that the manager can properly track and control the bot's beast
    mastery pet during gameplay, including handling pet summoning, command execution,
    and behavior management.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will be managed
      by this BeastMasteryPetManager instance. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization of BeastMasteryPetManager
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Assume player object is already created

      BeastMasteryPetManager petManager(myBot);

      // The pet manager is now initialized and ready to manage the bot''s beast mastery
      pet'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor should only be called once per player bot instance. The
    provided Player pointer must remain valid for the lifetime of the BeastMasteryPetManager
    object to prevent undefined behavior.
