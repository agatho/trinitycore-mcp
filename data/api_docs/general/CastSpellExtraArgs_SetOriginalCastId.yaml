  class: CastSpellExtraArgs
  method: SetOriginalCastId
  signature: CastSpellExtraArgs & CastSpellExtraArgs::SetOriginalCastId(const int
    & castId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the original cast identifier for a spell casting operation.
  description: The SetOriginalCastId method assigns a unique identifier to track the
    original cast of a spell within the TrinityCore framework. This is particularly
    useful in scenarios involving spell stacking, proc systems, or when tracking the
    source of a spell cast for effects like cooldowns, aura tracking, or spell linking.
    The method modifies the CastSpellExtraArgs object in-place and returns a reference
    to itself to allow for method chaining. It's commonly used in custom spell handlers
    or when extending core spell mechanics to maintain proper casting context.
  parameters:
  - name: castId
    description: The integer identifier representing the original cast ID to be assigned.
      This value should typically be a unique identifier generated by the system or
      passed from an existing spell cast context.
  returns: A reference to the modified CastSpellExtraArgs object, enabling method
    chaining for fluent API usage.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'CastSpellExtraArgs args;

      args.SetOriginalCastId(12345);

      // The args object now has its original cast ID set to 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining
    code: "CastSpellExtraArgs args;\nargs.SetOriginalCastId(98765)\n    .SetCastTime(1000)\n\
      \    .SetTriggeredByAura(42);\n// All properties are set in a fluent manner"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the spell casting infrastructure and should be used
    carefully when modifying spell behavior. The castId parameter must be a valid
    integer; however, no validation is performed internally. It's recommended to use
    unique identifiers to avoid conflicts in spell tracking systems.
  warnings: Incorrect or duplicate cast IDs may lead to unexpected behavior in spell
    stacking, aura application, or cooldown handling. Ensure that the provided castId
    is meaningful and consistent with the spell casting context.
