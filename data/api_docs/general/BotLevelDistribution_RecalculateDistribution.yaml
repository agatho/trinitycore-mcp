  signature: void BotLevelDistribution::RecalculateDistribution()
documentation:
  brief: Updates and recalculates the distribution of bot levels based on current
    server settings and configurations.
  description: The RecalculateDistribution method dynamically adjusts the level distribution
    of bots within the TrinityCore environment. This function ensures that the number
    of bots at each level adheres to configured ratios or constraints, typically used
    in automated testing, bot management systems, or AI-driven player population simulations.
    It may be invoked when configuration parameters change, or during initialization
    of bot systems. The method does not return any value but modifies internal state
    variables related to bot level allocation.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLevelDistribution distribution;

      distribution.RecalculateDistribution();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely called internally by the bot management system upon
    configuration updates or server startup. It may involve iterating through all
    active bots and adjusting their levels according to defined rules.
