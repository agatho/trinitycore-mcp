documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the InteractionValidator class with default
    settings.
  description: The InteractionValidator constructor initializes the validation state
    and prepares the object for performing interaction checks. This method sets up
    internal data structures and default configurations required for validating player
    interactions within the TrinityCore framework. It ensures that all necessary resources
    are allocated and ready for use when subsequent validation methods are called.
    The initialization process typically occurs during object creation and does not
    require any external parameters.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new InteractionValidator instance
    code: 'InteractionValidator validator;

      // The validator is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor performs minimal initialization. Additional setup may be
    required before using the validator for actual interaction checks. The object
    should not be used until properly constructed.
