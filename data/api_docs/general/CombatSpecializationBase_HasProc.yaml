  class: CombatSpecializationBase
  method: HasProc
  signature: bool CombatSpecializationBase::HasProc(uint32 procId) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a specific proc ID is associated with the combat specialization.
  description: The HasProc method determines whether a given proc ID is registered
    or active within the current combat specialization. This functionality is typically
    used in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to evaluate if a particular spell effect
    or ability proc should be triggered based on the character's current specialization.
    The method performs a lookup in the internal proc list associated with the specialization
    and returns true if the specified proc ID exists, otherwise false. It is commonly
    invoked during combat event processing to determine conditional spell activation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the specified proc ID is found within the combat specialization's
    proc list; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Proc Check
    code: "if (player->GetCombatSpecialization()->HasProc(12345)) {\n    // Execute\
      \ proc-specific logic\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_PROC_EFFECT, true);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Proc Activation
    code: "uint32 procId = 67890;\nif (combatSpec->HasProc(procId)) {\n    // Apply\
      \ specialization-specific proc effects\n    player->AddAura(SPELL_SPECIALIZATION_PROC_AURA,\
      \ player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with spell proc systems and
    specialization-based abilities. The proc ID parameter should correspond to a valid
    spell or ability ID defined within the TrinityCore database. Performance is generally
    fast as it relies on internal lookup structures, but frequent calls during high-frequency
    combat events may impact performance if not optimized.
  warnings: Ensure that the procId passed to this method corresponds to an actual
    registered proc in the specialization system; otherwise, the method will return
    false. Avoid calling this method in tight loops without caching results, as it
    may cause unnecessary overhead during combat processing.
