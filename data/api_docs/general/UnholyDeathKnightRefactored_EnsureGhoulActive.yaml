  method: EnsureGhoulActive
  signature: void UnholyDeathKnightRefactored::EnsureGhoulActive()
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that the Death Knight's ghoul pet is active and ready for combat.
  description: The EnsureGhoulActive method checks whether the Unholy Death Knight's
    summoned ghoul pet is currently active and in a usable state. If the ghoul is
    not active or has been dismissed, this method will attempt to summon or reactivate
    it. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the effectiveness of unholy
    death knight abilities that rely on the ghoul's presence, such as Ghoul Frenzy
    or various pet-based spells. The method typically integrates with the Death Knight's
    pet management system and ensures that combat readiness is maintained during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: "void MyDeathKnight::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    m_unholyDK.EnsureGhoulActive();\n\
      \    // Ghoul is now guaranteed to be active for combat\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal pet state tracking and may perform
    checks against cooldowns or summoning requirements. It should only be called when
    the Death Knight is in a valid state to manage their pet (e.g., not in a taxi
    flight or during certain spell casts).
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate combat or state contexts may
    result in unexpected behavior or failure to properly summon the ghoul. Ensure
    that the Death Knight has sufficient resources and conditions are met before invoking.
