  brief: Retrieves a snapshot of current market data for a specified item.
  description: The GetMarketSnapshot method fetches the most recent market analysis
    data for a given item ID, including pricing information, supply, and demand trends.
    This method is typically used by in-game systems or addons that require up-to-date
    market data for economic simulations or player trading assistance. The returned
    snapshot contains comprehensive details about the item's market status at the
    time of retrieval.

    description: The unique identifier of the item for which to retrieve market data.
      Must correspond to a valid item in the game database.

    market data is available for the given item ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "MarketSnapshot snapshot = marketAnalysis.GetMarketSnapshot(12345);\nif\
      \ (snapshot.IsValid()) {\n    std::cout << \"Current price: \" << snapshot.GetPrice()\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Handling Invalid Item IDs
    code: "MarketSnapshot snapshot = marketAnalysis.GetMarketSnapshot(999999);\nif\
      \ (!snapshot.IsValid()) {\n    // Handle case where item has no market data\n\
      \    std::cout << \"No market data available for this item.\" << std::endl;\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve database queries and should be used judiciously to
    avoid performance impact. The snapshot data is typically cached and refreshed
    periodically based on server settings.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent item ID may return
    a default/empty snapshot without throwing an exception. Always validate the returned
    snapshot before using its data.
