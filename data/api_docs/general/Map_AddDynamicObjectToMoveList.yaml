  class: Map
  method: AddDynamicObjectToMoveList
  signature: void Map::AddDynamicObjectToMoveList(int * go, float x, float y, float
    z, float ang)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a dynamic object to the map's movement list for processing.
  description: The AddDynamicObjectToMoveList method is responsible for registering
    a dynamic object (such as a game object or unit) with the map's movement system.
    This ensures that the object's position and orientation are properly updated and
    synchronized within the game world. The method takes the object's identifier along
    with its new coordinates and angle, which are then queued for processing in the
    next update cycle. This is typically used internally by the core engine when objects
    need to be moved or repositioned dynamically during gameplay.
  parameters:
  - name: go
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the unique identifier of the dynamic
      object to be added to the movement list.
  - name: x
    description: The new X coordinate for the object's position in the game world.
  - name: y
    description: The new Y coordinate for the object's position in the game world.
  - name: z
    description: The new Z coordinate for the object's position in the game world.
  - name: ang
    description: The new angular orientation (in radians) of the object.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of AddDynamicObjectToMoveList
    code: 'int objectId = 12345;

      float newX = 100.0f, newY = 200.0f, newZ = 50.0f;

      float newAngle = 1.57f; // 90 degrees in radians

      Map* map = player->GetMap();

      map->AddDynamicObjectToMoveList(&objectId, newX, newY, newZ, newAngle);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core engine and should
    not usually be invoked directly by script or addon developers. It is part of the
    internal movement handling system for dynamic objects on the map.
