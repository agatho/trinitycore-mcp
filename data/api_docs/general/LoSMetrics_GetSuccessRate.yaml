  class: LoSMetrics
  method: GetSuccessRate
  signature: float LoSMetrics::GetSuccessRate() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the line-of-sight success rate for the current LoSMetrics
    instance.
  description: The GetSuccessRate method computes the percentage of successful line-of-sight
    checks performed by this LoSMetrics instance. It typically represents the ratio
    of visible targets to total attempted checks, which is crucial for determining
    visibility in World of Warcraft's combat and AI systems. This metric helps evaluate
    the effectiveness of line-of-sight algorithms used in pathfinding, targeting,
    and spell casting mechanics. The method does not require any parameters and returns
    a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no successful
    checks and 1.0 indicates all checks were successful.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the success rate of line-of-sight checks, ranging
    from 0.0 (no successes) to 1.0 (all successes).
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'LoSMetrics metrics;

      float successRate = metrics.GetSuccessRate();

      printf("Line-of-sight success rate: %.2f%%\n", successRate * 100.0f);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used internally by TrinityCore's AI and movement systems
    to evaluate the effectiveness of visibility checks. The implementation may cache
    previous results or update incrementally based on new line-of-sight events.
