  signature: void Player::UpdateAverageItemLevelEquipped()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's average item level equipped value based on currently
    worn gear.
  description: The UpdateAverageItemLevelEquipped method recalculates and updates
    the player's average item level for equipped items. This value is used in various
    game systems including raid difficulty calculations, achievement tracking, and
    character progression metrics. The method iterates through all currently equipped
    items on the player and computes their average item level, which is then stored
    internally for use by other subsystems. This method is typically called automatically
    when equipment changes occur, but can also be invoked manually to ensure synchronization
    after custom modifications to a player's inventory.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Manual update of item level average
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      // After modifying player''s equipment

      player->UpdateAverageItemLevelEquipped();

      // Average item level is now recalculated and updated'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs calculations on all currently equipped items, so it
    may have performance implications if called frequently. The recalculation includes
    all inventory slots except bags and bank slots. The updated value is typically
    cached internally and used by other systems like GetAverageItemLevelEquipped().
  warnings: Calling this method manually when equipment hasn't changed may cause unnecessary
    computation. Avoid calling this in tight loops or high-frequency update contexts
    without proper throttling.
