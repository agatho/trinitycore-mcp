  signature: Item * RestStrategy::FindBandage(BotAI * ai) const
documentation:
  brief: Searches for and returns a usable bandage item in the bot's inventory for
    healing purposes.
  description: The FindBandage method is used by the RestStrategy AI class to locate
    a suitable bandage item within the bot's inventory. This method is typically invoked
    during rest-based healing routines where the AI needs to determine if a healing
    item is available. The method evaluates the bot's inventory for items that are
    classified as bandages and returns a pointer to the first valid bandage found.
    If no usable bandage is present, it will return a null pointer. This functionality
    is crucial for bots that employ rest-based strategies to recover health while
    avoiding combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to an Item object representing a bandage if one is found
    in the bot's inventory; otherwise returns nullptr if no valid bandage item exists.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "Item* bandage = ai->GetBot()->GetRestStrategy()->FindBandage(ai);\nif (bandage)\n\
      {\n    // Use the bandage for healing\n    ai->UseItem(bandage);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the bot AI's rest strategy and assumes that the bot
    has inventory access. The method does not perform any item usage or modification;
    it only locates items. It may be called frequently during rest states, so performance
    should be considered in high-frequency scenarios.
  warnings: Ensure that the BotAI pointer passed to this method is valid and initialized
    before calling. The returned Item pointer must be checked for null before attempting
    to use it, as the method may return nullptr if no bandage is available.
