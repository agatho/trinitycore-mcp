documentation:
  brief: Updates the player's parry percentage based on equipped weapons and attributes.
  description: The UpdateParryPercentage method recalculates and updates the player's
    chance to parry incoming melee attacks. This calculation takes into account the
    player's equipped main-hand and off-hand weapons, their agility, weapon skill
    levels, and other relevant combat statistics. The method is typically invoked
    when equipment changes or when combat-related stats are modified. It ensures that
    the player's parry chance reflects current game state and character progression.

  notes: This method is automatically called by the core when equipment changes or
    when relevant stats are modified. Developers should not typically call this method
    directly unless implementing custom combat logic or debugging.
