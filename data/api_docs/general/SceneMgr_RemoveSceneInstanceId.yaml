  signature: void SceneMgr::RemoveSceneInstanceId(uint32 sceneInstanceID)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a scene instance by its unique identifier from the scene manager.
  description: The RemoveSceneInstanceId method removes a specific scene instance
    from the SceneMgr's internal tracking system using its unique scene instance ID.
    This method is typically invoked when a scene has completed or needs to be explicitly
    cleared from memory. The scene instance ID is usually obtained when creating a
    scene using methods like AddSceneInstance. Removing a scene instance ensures that
    associated resources are freed and prevents further interaction with that particular
    scene instance. This operation is essential for managing scene lifecycle in TrinityCore's
    scene system, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic or temporary scenes.
  parameters:
  - name: sceneInstanceID
    description: The unique identifier of the scene instance to be removed. This ID
      must correspond to an existing scene instance managed by the SceneMgr. Valid
      values are positive integers that have been previously returned by AddSceneInstance
      or similar creation methods.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove a Scene Instance
    code: 'uint32 instanceId = sSceneMgr->AddSceneInstance(12345, player);

      // ... some operations with the scene ...

      sSceneMgr->RemoveSceneInstanceId(instanceId);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Scene Removal
    code: "if (sceneInstanceId != 0)\n{\n    sSceneMgr->RemoveSceneInstanceId(sceneInstanceId);\n\
      \    sceneInstanceId = 0;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the provided sceneInstanceID is valid and corresponds
    to an existing scene. It's recommended to validate the ID before calling this
    method to avoid potential issues. The removal process may involve cleanup of associated
    resources such as scene objects, animations, or effects tied to the instance.
  warnings: Calling RemoveSceneInstanceId with an invalid or non-existent sceneInstanceID
    can lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always ensure that the ID was previously
    returned by a successful AddSceneInstance call before attempting removal.
