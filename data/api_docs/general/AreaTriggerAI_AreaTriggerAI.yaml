  brief: Moves an AreaTriggerAI object, transferring ownership of its resources to
    the new instance.
  description: The AreaTriggerAI move constructor initializes a new AreaTriggerAI
    instance by transferring the resources from an existing AreaTriggerAI rvalue reference.
    This constructor is typically used when objects need to be moved rather than copied,
    which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary deep copies. In the context
    of TrinityCore's AI system, this allows for efficient management of area trigger
    AI instances during object creation and reassignment scenarios. The move constructor
    ensures that the source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after
    the operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Moving an AreaTriggerAI instance
    code: 'AreaTriggerAI* original = new AreaTriggerAI();

      AreaTriggerAI movedInstance = std::move(*original);

      // original is now in a valid but unspecified state

      // movedInstance contains the resources from original'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is automatically generated by the compiler when no user-defined
    move constructor exists. It performs a member-wise move of all base class and
    member objects, assuming they are movable. The source object should not be used
    after being moved from, as its state becomes undefined.
  warnings: Using a moved-from object can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that
    any pointers or references to the original object are not accessed after the move
    operation. This constructor is typically used internally by the standard library
    containers and should rarely be called directly in user code.
