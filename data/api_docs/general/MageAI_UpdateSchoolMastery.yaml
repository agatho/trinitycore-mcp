documentation:
  brief: Updates the MageAI's school mastery values based on current spell data and
    player abilities.
  description: The UpdateSchoolMastery method recalculates and applies the mastery
    effects for a mage's primary schools of magic. This function is typically invoked
    during AI updates to ensure that the mage's spell selection and casting behavior
    reflects their current mastery levels. It adjusts spell priorities, damage multipliers,
    and cooldown reductions based on the player's mastery stats. The method operates
    within the context of the TrinityCore AI system for class-specific behavior, particularly
    relevant for Mage characters in World of Warcraft environments.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void MageAI::Update()\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n    UpdateSchoolMastery();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the MageAI class and should only be called when the
    AI system requires an update to spell mastery calculations. It does not directly
    modify player stats but rather influences internal AI decision-making processes.
