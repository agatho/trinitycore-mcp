  signature: void InstanceScript::SetEntranceLocation(uint32 worldSafeLocationId)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the entrance location for the instance script using a world safe location
    ID.
  description: The SetEntranceLocation method configures the entrance point for an
    instance script by specifying a world safe location identifier. This location
    is typically used when players enter an instance and need to be teleported to
    a designated safe area. The method does not perform any teleportation itself but
    rather stores the location ID for later use, often in conjunction with other instance
    management functions. It's commonly called during instance initialization or when
    setting up player entry points within dungeon or raid encounters.
  parameters:
  - name: worldSafeLocationId
    description: The unique identifier of the world safe location where players should
      be teleported upon entering the instance. This ID corresponds to entries in
      the WorldSafeLocs database table and defines a specific location with safety
      parameters such as coordinates, map ID, and teleportation rules.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Entrance Location for Instance
    code: "class BossInstance : public InstanceScript\n{\npublic:\n    BossInstance(Map*\
      \ map) : InstanceScript(map) {}\n    \n    void Initialize() override\n    {\n\
      \        SetEntranceLocation(12345); // Sets entrance to location ID 12345\n\
      \    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with instance management systems
    and should be called during the initialization phase of an instance. The worldSafeLocationId
    parameter must correspond to a valid entry in the WorldSafeLocs database table,
    otherwise it may result in undefined behavior or failed teleportations.
