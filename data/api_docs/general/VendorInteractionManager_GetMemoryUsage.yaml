  method: GetMemoryUsage
  signature: size_t VendorInteractionManager::GetMemoryUsage() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total memory usage of the vendor interaction manager's
    internal data structures.
  description: The GetMemoryUsage method computes the total amount of memory currently
    allocated by the VendorInteractionManager for its internal tracking of vendor
    interactions. This includes memory used for storing item lists, transaction records,
    and any associated metadata related to vendor interactions within the game world.
    The method is typically used for debugging, performance monitoring, or memory
    profiling purposes to understand how much memory the manager is consuming. It
    provides a snapshot of current memory consumption at the time of the call and
    does not account for future allocations or deallocations that might occur during
    subsequent operations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a size_t value representing the total memory usage in bytes consumed
    by all internal data structures managed by this VendorInteractionManager instance.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Memory Usage Check
    code: 'size_t memoryUsed = vendorInteractionManager.GetMemoryUsage();

      TC_LOG_INFO("misc", "Vendor interaction manager is using %zu bytes of memory.",
      memoryUsed);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a summation of all allocated memory blocks managed by
    the VendorInteractionManager. It may involve iterating through internal containers
    or data structures, so it should not be called excessively in performance-critical
    code paths. The returned value is only valid at the moment of the call and will
    change as new interactions are processed or cleaned up.
