  class: MaelstromWeaponTracker
  method: ConsumeStacks
  signature: void MaelstromWeaponTracker::ConsumeStacks()
documentation:
  brief: Consumes available stacks from the Maelstrom Weapon tracker, reducing its
    current stack count.
  description: The ConsumeStacks method is responsible for decrementing the internal
    stack counter of a Maelstrom Weapon tracker. This typically occurs when the weapon's
    effects are triggered or consumed, such as during attacks that utilize the maelstrom
    energy. The method ensures proper state management of the weapon's energy resources
    and may trigger additional game mechanics depending on the remaining stack count.
    It is commonly used in conjunction with other tracking methods to manage the lifecycle
    of maelstrom-based abilities.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat
    code: 'MaelstromWeaponTracker tracker;

      // Assume tracker has 5 stacks

      tracker.ConsumeStacks();

      // Tracker now has 4 stacks'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the weapon is actively being used
    in combat or when stack consumption is explicitly required by game rules. The
    internal state of the tracker must be properly initialized before calling this
    method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the MaelstromWeaponTracker
    may lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Ensure that stacks are available before
    consuming them to prevent negative stack counts.
