  brief: Saves player customizations to the database with transaction support
  description: The SaveCustomizations method persists player appearance and customization
    data to the database. It accepts transaction, GUID, and customizations parameters
    to ensure proper database handling. This method is typically called when a player
    modifies their character's appearance, such as changing race, gender, facial features,
    or hair style. The method handles database transactions to maintain data consistency
    and ensures that all customization changes are properly saved to the account's
    character records.
  parameters:
  - name: trans
    description: Database transaction handle used for atomic operations. If non-zero,
      the save operation will be performed within the specified transaction context.
  - name: guid
    description: Unique identifier of the player character. This value is used to
      locate and update the correct character record in the database.
  - name: customizations
    description: Integer value representing the customization data to be saved. This
      typically contains packed appearance information including race, gender, facial
      features, hair style, and other visual attributes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage with transaction
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 trans = 0;

      uint32 guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      int customizations = player->GetCustomizationData();

      player->SaveCustomizations(trans, guid, customizations);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Saving customizations within a database transaction
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      uint32 guid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      int customizations = player->GetCustomizationData();

      WorldDatabaseTransaction* trans = new WorldDatabaseTransaction();

      player->SaveCustomizations((int)trans, guid, customizations);

      trans->Execute();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically when a player's appearance
    changes through the game interface. The implementation uses database transactions
    to ensure data integrity during save operations. Developers should be aware that
    this method may perform blocking database I/O operations and should consider performance
    implications in high-traffic scenarios.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUID values or improper transaction handles
    can result in database corruption or failed saves. The customizations parameter
    must contain valid packed appearance data; otherwise, the save operation may fail
    silently or corrupt existing customization data.
