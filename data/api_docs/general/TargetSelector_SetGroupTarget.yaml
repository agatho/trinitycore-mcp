  class: TargetSelector
  method: SetGroupTarget
  signature: void TargetSelector::SetGroupTarget(Unit * target)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the target unit for the group's target selector.
  description: The SetGroupTarget method assigns a specific Unit as the target for
    the group's target selection logic. This method is typically used in AI behavior
    systems where a group of creatures or players needs to focus on a single target.
    The target unit must be valid and within the appropriate scope for the selector
    to function correctly. This method does not perform any validation on the input
    target, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure the target is suitable.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object that will be set as the group's target.
      Must be a valid Unit pointer; null pointers may cause undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Unit* target = player->GetVictim();

      TargetSelector selector;

      selector.SetGroupTarget(target);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Target in AI Context
    code: "class MyAI : public CreatureAI {\npublic:\n    void UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\
      \ override {\n        if (!me->GetVictim())\n            return;\n        \n\
      \        targetSelector.SetGroupTarget(me->GetVictim());\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the internal state of the TargetSelector. It
    should only be called when the AI or game logic requires a change in group targeting
    behavior. The target unit's validity is not checked internally, so callers must
    ensure it remains valid for the duration of use.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this method may lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the target unit is valid and alive before calling
    this method. Additionally, setting a new target while another is active may cause
    unexpected AI behavior if not handled properly.
