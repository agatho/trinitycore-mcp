  class: Player
  method: SetLastPotionId
  signature: void Player::SetLastPotionId(uint32 item_id)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the last used potion ID for the player.
  description: This method updates the internal tracking of the last potion item ID
    used by the player. It is primarily used to maintain game state information about
    potion usage and can be utilized in various gameplay mechanics including cooldown
    management, item tracking, and quest progression. The method does not directly
    affect the potion's actual usage but rather records the ID for future reference
    or validation purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: item_id
    description: The unique identifier of the potion item that was last used. This
      parameter represents the item entry ID from the game database, typically corresponding
      to a specific potion item in the database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Last Potion ID
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      uint32 potionId = 12345;

      player->SetLastPotionId(potionId);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other potion-related methods
    and should be called whenever a potion is consumed. The implementation likely
    involves updating an internal variable or database field that tracks the last
    potion ID used by the player.
  warnings: Care must be taken when using this method as it may affect game mechanics
    related to cooldowns or quest progression if not properly handled. Improper usage
    could lead to incorrect tracking of potion usage.
