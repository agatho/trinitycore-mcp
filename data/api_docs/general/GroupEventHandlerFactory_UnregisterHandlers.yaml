  signature: void GroupEventHandlerFactory::UnregisterHandlers(BotAI * botAI)
documentation:
  brief: Unregisters all event handlers associated with the specified BotAI instance
    from the GroupEventHandlerFactory.
  description: The UnregisterHandlers method removes all registered event handlers
    that were previously associated with a given BotAI instance. This is typically
    called when a bot is being destroyed or deactivated to prevent memory leaks and
    ensure proper cleanup of event subscriptions. The method iterates through internal
    handler mappings and removes references to the specified BotAI, ensuring no dangling
    pointers or callback invocations occur after the bot's lifecycle ends. It is important
    that this method be called before the BotAI object is destroyed to maintain system
    stability.

  - title: Basic Usage in Bot Cleanup
    code: "void CleanupBot(BotAI* bot)\n{\n    // Perform bot-specific cleanup\n \
      \   bot->Cleanup();\n    \n    // Unregister all event handlers associated with\
      \ this bot\n    GroupEventHandlerFactory::UnregisterHandlers(bot);\n    \n \
      \   // Now safe to delete the bot object\n    delete bot;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the BotAI instance passed to it is valid and has
    previously had handlers registered via GroupEventHandlerFactory. It's recommended
    to call this method as part of a bot's destruction sequence to avoid potential
    crashes or undefined behavior due to dangling event callbacks.
