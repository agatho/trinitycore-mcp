  class: GameEventMgr
  method: StopEvent
  signature: void GameEventMgr::StopEvent(uint16 event_id, bool overwrite)
documentation:
  brief: Stops a specified game event, optionally overwriting its current state.
  description: The StopEvent method is used to halt a running game event identified
    by its unique event_id. This method allows for stopping events either temporarily
    or permanently, depending on the overwrite flag. When overwrite is set to true,
    it forces the event to stop and potentially resets its internal state. The method
    does not return any value and operates directly on the GameEventMgr singleton
    instance. It's commonly used in custom scripts or event handlers to programmatically
    control when game events should cease execution.
  parameters:
  - name: event_id
    description: The unique identifier of the game event to be stopped. This value
      corresponds to the ID field defined in the game_event table within the database.
  - name: overwrite
    description: A boolean flag indicating whether to overwrite the current event
      state. If true, forces immediate stop and potential reset of the event's internal
      tracking. If false, only stops the event without overwriting its existing state.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: GameEventMgr::instance().StopEvent(42, true);
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Event Stop
    code: "if (player->HasItemCount(ITEM_ID_FOR_EVENT_TRIGGER))\n{\n    GameEventMgr::instance().StopEvent(101,\
      \ false);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as it operates on the singleton instance of GameEventMgr.
    It should be called from within the game's main thread context to ensure consistency
    with event state management.
  warnings: Improper use of the overwrite flag can lead to unexpected behavior in
    event handling logic. Ensure that stopping an event does not break dependent systems
    or quests that rely on the event's completion.
