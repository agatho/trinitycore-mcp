documentation:
  brief: Clears the changes mask of the scene object data, resetting its modified
    state flags.
  description: The ClearChangesMask method resets the internal changes mask associated
    with a SceneObjectData instance. This operation is typically used to indicate
    that all previously marked modifications to the scene object have been processed
    or acknowledged. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation,
    scene objects are often used for dynamic world effects such as quest objectives,
    visual triggers, or interactive elements. Clearing the changes mask allows the
    server to track which scene objects have undergone modifications since the last
    update cycle, ensuring efficient synchronization with clients. This method does
    not take any parameters and performs no return operations.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'SceneObjectData* sceneObj = GetSceneObjectData();

      sceneObj->ClearChangesMask();

      // The changes mask is now cleared, indicating no pending updates for this object.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is commonly called after processing scene object changes to prevent
    redundant updates. It's important to understand that clearing the mask does not
    affect the actual data within the scene object; it only resets the tracking mechanism
    used to determine if changes exist.
