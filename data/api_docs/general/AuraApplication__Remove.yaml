documentation:
  brief: Removes the aura application from the target unit and cleans up associated
    resources.
  description: The _Remove method is an internal function used to completely remove
    an AuraApplication from its target unit. This method handles the cleanup of aura-related
    data structures, notifies the system that the aura is no longer active, and ensures
    proper removal from any tracking systems. It is typically called when an aura
    expires, is dispelled, or is manually removed through game mechanics. The method
    performs necessary bookkeeping to maintain consistency in the aura system and
    prevents memory leaks by releasing references to the aura data.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Aura Removal
    code: "AuraApplication* app = unit->GetAuraApplication(12345);\nif (app)\n{\n\
      \    app->_Remove();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This is an internal method and should not be called directly by external
    code. It's typically invoked by the aura system when managing aura lifecycles.
    The method assumes that the aura application has been properly initialized and
    is valid before removal.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already-removed or invalid AuraApplication can
    lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Always verify the aura application's validity
    before calling _Remove().
