documentation:
  brief: Returns the spell penetration item modifier value for the player.
  description: This method retrieves the spell penetration item modifier that is applied
    to the player's spell penetration. Spell penetration is a stat that reduces the
    chance that enemy targets will resist your spells. This modifier represents the
    total amount of spell penetration provided by items worn by the player, such as
    weapons or armor. The value returned is typically positive and reflects the combined
    effect of all applicable item bonuses. It does not include any bonus from talents
    or other sources.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the total spell penetration item
    modifier. This value can be positive or negative, with positive values indicating
    increased spell penetration from items, and negative values indicating decreased
    spell penetration due to item effects.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int32 penetration = player->GetSpellPenetrationItemMod();\nif (penetration\
      \ > 0)\n{\n    // Player has increased spell penetration from items\n    printf(\"\
      Spell penetration: %d\\n\", penetration);\n}\nelse if (penetration < 0)\n{\n\
      \    // Player has decreased spell penetration from items\n    printf(\"Spell\
      \ penetration: %d\\n\", penetration);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // No spell penetration\
      \ modifier from items\n    printf(\"No spell penetration modifier\\n\");\n}"

  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell penetration
    related functions to calculate overall spell penetration for a player. It should
    be noted that this value does not include any bonuses from talents or other sources,
    only item-based modifiers.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no spell penetration items are equipped,
    or if the player has no item bonuses applied. Care should be taken when using
    this method in calculations involving spell penetration, as it does not account
    for talent or other bonuses that might affect overall spell penetration.
