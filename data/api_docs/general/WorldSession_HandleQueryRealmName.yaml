  signature: void WorldSession::HandleQueryRealmName(WorldPackets::Query::QueryRealmName
    & queryRealmName)
documentation:
  brief: Handles incoming realm name query requests from clients, responding with
    the queried realm's name information.
  description: The HandleQueryRealmName method processes client requests to retrieve
    specific realm name data. This method is typically invoked when a player or game
    client needs to obtain detailed information about a particular realm, such as
    its name, type, and status. It serves as part of the TrinityCore's network protocol
    handling for realm-related queries. The method operates within the WorldSession
    context, meaning it handles communication with a specific connected client. It
    expects a QueryRealmName packet containing the realm identifier or other identifying
    information, and responds by sending back the appropriate realm name data to the
    requesting client.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in network handler
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleQueryRealmName(WorldPackets::Query::QueryRealmName&\
      \ queryRealmName)\n{\n    // Process realm name query\n    SendQueryRealmNameResponse(queryRealmName.RealmId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore's packet handling system and should
    only be called from within a valid WorldSession context. It relies on proper packet
    validation before processing to prevent malformed data issues.
  warnings: Improper handling of realm ID or packet data may result in incorrect responses
    or client disconnections. Ensure that realm IDs are validated against existing
    realms before responding.
