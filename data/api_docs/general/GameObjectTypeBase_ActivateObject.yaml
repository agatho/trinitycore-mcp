    param, int * spellCaster, uint32 spellId, int32 effectIndex)
documentation:
  brief: Activates a game object with specified actions and parameters, triggering
    associated events or effects.
  description: The ActivateObject method is used to trigger specific behaviors or
    actions on a GameObjectTypeBase instance. It accepts various parameters that define
    how the activation should be processed, including the type of action to perform,
    parameter values, spell caster information, spell ID, and effect index. This method
    typically integrates with the game's event system to handle object interactions
    such as door openings, lever activations, or quest-related triggers. The method
    does not return any value but modifies the state of the GameObject based on the
    provided parameters.
  parameters:
  - name: action
    description: Specifies the type of action to be performed on the game object.
      This is an enum value that determines how the object will behave during activation.
  - name: param
    description: An integer parameter that provides additional context or configuration
      for the activation action. The meaning of this value depends on the specific
      action being executed.
  - name: spellCaster
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the spell caster's identifier,
      used when the activation involves spell effects. Can be null if no spell caster
      is involved.
  - name: spellId
    description: The ID of the spell associated with this activation. Used primarily
      when the action involves casting a spell or applying spell effects to the object.
  - name: effectIndex
    description: Index specifying which effect within a spell should be applied during
      activation. This is useful for multi-effect spells where only one specific effect
      needs to be triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic GameObject Activation
    code: 'GameObjectTypeBase* go = ...; // Assume a valid GameObjectTypeBase instance

      int32 param = 1;

      int spellCaster = 0;

      uint32 spellId = 12345;

      int32 effectIndex = 0;

      go->ActivateObject(GameObjectActions::ACTION_USE, param, &spellCaster, spellId,
      effectIndex);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Triggering a Spell-Based Activation
    code: 'GameObjectTypeBase* go = ...;

      int32 param = 0;

      int spellCaster = 42;

      uint32 spellId = 98765;

      int32 effectIndex = 2;

      go->ActivateObject(GameObjectActions::ACTION_CAST_SPELL, param, &spellCaster,
      spellId, effectIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked by the game engine when an object interaction
    occurs, such as a player clicking on a lever or using a door. The implementation
    may vary depending on the specific GameObject type and its associated scripts.
    Developers should ensure that all parameters are properly initialized before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Incorrect usage of spellId or effectIndex can lead to unexpected spell
    effects or crashes. Always validate parameter values, especially when dealing
    with dynamic spell casting scenarios. Using a null pointer for spellCaster without
    proper checks may cause access violations.
