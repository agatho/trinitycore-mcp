  class: BattlePetManager
  method: GetPetCount
  signature: uint32 BattlePetManager::GetPetCount(int * player) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total count of battle pets owned by the specified player.
  description: The GetPetCount method retrieves the number of battle pets currently
    in the player's collection. This method is typically used within the BattlePetManager
    class to provide information about a player's pet inventory. The method accepts
    a pointer to an integer representing the player's ID and returns a uint32 value
    indicating how many battle pets are associated with that player. It is important
    to note that this method does not validate whether the player ID is valid or active,
    so calling it with an invalid player ID may result in incorrect data being returned.
    The implementation likely accesses internal pet tracking structures within the
    BattlePetManager.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID). This parameter is used to identify which player's pet count should be
      retrieved.
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of battle pets owned by the
    specified player. Returns 0 if no pets are found or if the player ID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: uint32 petCount = battlePetManager->GetPetCount(&playerGuid);
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Pet Count Before Adding New Pet
    code: "int playerGuid = 12345;\nuint32 currentPets = battlePetManager->GetPetCount(&playerGuid);\n\
      if (currentPets < MAX_PETS_PER_PLAYER)\n{\n    // Add new pet logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely implemented using internal data structures that track
    player pet collections. It may not account for pets in temporary states or those
    not yet saved to the database. The method assumes a valid player ID is passed;
    otherwise, results are undefined.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or uninitialized player GUID pointer can lead to undefined
    behavior. Ensure the player ID points to a valid, active player before calling
    this method. This method does not perform any validation on the input parameter.
