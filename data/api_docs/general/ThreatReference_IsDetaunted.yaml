documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the threat reference has been detaunted, indicating if the
    target is immune to taunt effects.
  description: The IsDetaunted method determines if a ThreatReference object represents
    a unit that is currently immune to taunt effects. This typically occurs when a
    creature or player has been affected by a taunt immunity effect such as Divine
    Shield, Barkskin, or other similar defensive abilities. The method returns true
    if the target cannot be taunted, and false if it can still be subjected to taunt
    mechanics. This is commonly used in AI decision-making processes to avoid attempting
    taunt actions on immune targets.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the threat reference's target is immune to taunt effects
    (detaunted), false otherwise. A return value of true indicates that any attempt
    to apply taunt mechanics to this target will be ineffective.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Logic
    code: "if (!threatRef.IsDetaunted()) {\n    // Attempt to taunt the target\n \
      \   attacker->Taunt(threatRef.GetTarget());\n} else {\n    // Target is immune,\
      \ skip taunt attempt\n    Log(\"Target is detaunted, skipping taunt.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely checks internal flags or aura states related to taunt
    immunity. It may be called frequently during AI processing, so performance should
    be considered in high-frequency contexts.
  warnings: Do not assume that a non-detaunted target will always accept taunts -
    additional checks for target validity and combat state should be performed before
    attempting taunt actions.
