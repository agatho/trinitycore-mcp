  signature: void TradeData::SetAccepted(bool state, bool forTrader)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the trade acceptance state for a player in a trade session
  description: The SetAccepted method updates the acceptance status of a trade proposal
    for either the player or their trading partner. This method is used internally
    by the TrinityCore trade system to track whether each party has accepted the current
    trade offer. When called with 'forTrader' set to true, it updates the trader's
    acceptance state; when false, it updates the player's acceptance state. The trade
    will only proceed once both parties have accepted.
  parameters:
  - name: state
    description: Boolean value indicating whether the trade is accepted (true) or
      not accepted (false)
  - name: forTrader
    description: Boolean flag determining which party's acceptance state to update
      - true for trader, false for player
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Accepting a trade offer as player
    code: 'TradeData* trade = player->GetTradeData();

      trade->SetAccepted(true, false); // Player accepts the trade'
    language: cpp
  - title: Rejecting a trade offer for trader
    code: 'TradeData* trade = player->GetTradeData();

      trade->SetAccepted(false, true); // Trader rejects the trade'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during trade processing and automatically
    triggers validation checks. The internal state tracking ensures that both parties
    must accept before a trade can be finalized.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper trade session management may result
    in inconsistent trade states or unexpected behavior. Always ensure the trade session
    is valid before calling SetAccepted.
