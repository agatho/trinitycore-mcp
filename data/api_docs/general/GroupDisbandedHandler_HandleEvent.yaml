documentation:
  brief: Handles the event when a group is disbanded in the game
  description: The GroupDisbandedHandler::HandleEvent method processes notifications
    when a player's group is disbanded, typically triggered by a player leaving the
    group or when the group is automatically disbanded due to inactivity or other
    conditions. This handler ensures proper cleanup of group-related data and updates
    player states accordingly. The method returns true if the event was successfully
    handled, false otherwise. It is part of TrinityCore's group management system
    and integrates with the game's event handling framework.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the group disband event was successfully processed and
    handled, false if there was an error during processing or if the event could not
    be properly managed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of GroupDisbandedHandler
    code: "GroupDisbandedHandler handler;\nGroupEvent event;\nbool result = handler.HandleEvent(event);\n\
      if (result) {\n    // Event processed successfully\n} else {\n    // Failed\
      \ to process event\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked internally by the TrinityCore server when
    group disband events occur. Developers should not call this method directly unless
    implementing custom group handling logic. The handler may perform cleanup operations
    such as updating player status, removing group references, and notifying other
    subsystems about the group's dissolution.
  warnings: Do not invoke this method manually without understanding the full context
    of group management in TrinityCore. Improper usage can lead to inconsistent player
    states or memory leaks. This method assumes proper initialization of the GroupEvent
    object before being called.
