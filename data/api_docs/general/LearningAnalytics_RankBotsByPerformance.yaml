  signature: std::vector<uint32_t> LearningAnalytics::RankBotsByPerformance() const
documentation:
  brief: Ranks all bots in the system by their performance metrics and returns a sorted
    list of bot identifiers.
  description: The RankBotsByPerformance method evaluates the performance of all active
    bots within the learning analytics framework. It analyzes various performance
    indicators such as task completion rates, response times, accuracy, and efficiency
    to determine an overall ranking. The method aggregates these metrics across all
    available bots and returns a vector containing the unique identifiers (GUIDs)
    of the bots sorted in descending order of performance. This functionality is typically
    used for monitoring bot effectiveness, identifying top-performing agents, or making
    decisions about resource allocation and bot optimization within the game environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A std::vector<uint32_t> containing the unique identifiers (GUIDs) of all
    bots, sorted in descending order of performance. The first element represents
    the highest performing bot, followed by progressively lower performing bots.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "LearningAnalytics analytics;\nstd::vector<uint32_t> rankedBots = analytics.RankBotsByPerformance();\n\
      for (uint32_t botId : rankedBots) {\n    std::cout << \"Bot ID: \" << botId\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method may involve computationally intensive operations if there are
    many bots to evaluate. It's recommended to cache results when the performance
    data doesn't change frequently. The ranking algorithm considers multiple metrics
    and weights them appropriately based on system configuration.
  warnings: The returned vector contains bot identifiers that should be validated
    before use, as some bots may have been removed or deactivated since the ranking
    was computed. Calling this method in a high-frequency loop without caching may
    impact performance.
