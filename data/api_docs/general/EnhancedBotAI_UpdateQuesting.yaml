  class: EnhancedBotAI
  method: UpdateQuesting
  signature: void EnhancedBotAI::UpdateQuesting(uint32 diff)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the questing behavior of the enhanced bot based on elapsed time.
  description: The UpdateQuesting method is responsible for managing and updating
    the quest-related activities of an EnhancedBotAI instance. It processes quest
    objectives, checks for quest completion conditions, handles quest acceptance or
    turn-in logic, and ensures that the bot's questing state remains synchronized
    with the game world. This method is typically called periodically by the AI system
    to maintain active quest progress and ensure proper quest handling during bot
    gameplay. The method uses the provided time delta (diff) to determine how much
    time has passed since the last update, which is essential for timing-based quest
    actions such as quest item collection or NPC interactions.
  parameters:
  - name: diff
    description: The time elapsed in milliseconds since the last update call. This
      value is used to calculate time-based quest progress and determine when timed
      events should be triggered.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic UpdateQuesting Call
    code: "void BotAI::Update(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Other AI updates...\n    m_enhancedBotAI->UpdateQuesting(diff);\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Main AI Loop
    code: "void EnhancedBotAI::Update()\n{\n    if (m_updateTimer > 0)\n    {\n  \
      \      m_updateTimer -= m_diff;\n        if (m_updateTimer <= 0)\n        {\n\
      \            UpdateQuesting(m_diff);\n            m_updateTimer = BOT_UPDATE_INTERVAL;\n\
      \        }\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly within the bot's update loop to ensure
    quest progression is handled properly. The diff parameter must accurately reflect
    the time passed since the last call to avoid timing inconsistencies in quest-related
    actions.
  warnings: Improper handling of the diff parameter may cause quest timers or time-sensitive
    events to behave incorrectly. Ensure that this method is not called too frequently
    or infrequently, as it could impact quest progression accuracy.
