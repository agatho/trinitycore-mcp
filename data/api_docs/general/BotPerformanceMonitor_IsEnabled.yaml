  class: BotPerformanceMonitor
  method: IsEnabled
  signature: bool BotPerformanceMonitor::IsEnabled() const
documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the bot performance monitor is currently enabled.
  description: The IsEnabled method determines if the bot performance monitoring system
    is active. This functionality allows developers and administrators to control
    when performance metrics are collected for bot behavior analysis. The method returns
    a boolean value indicating the current state of the performance monitor. When
    enabled, the monitor tracks various performance indicators such as update frequency,
    resource usage, and response times for bot operations. This feature is typically
    used in debugging and optimization scenarios to ensure bots operate efficiently
    within World of Warcraft's performance constraints.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the bot performance monitor is enabled, false otherwise.
    The return value indicates whether performance data collection is currently active
    for bot systems.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Check
    code: "if (botPerformanceMonitor.IsEnabled()) {\n    // Perform actions when monitoring\
      \ is enabled\n    sLog->outString(\"Bot performance monitoring is active\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Logging Based on State
    code: "void CheckAndLogPerformance() {\n    if (botPerformanceMonitor.IsEnabled())\
      \ {\n        // Log performance metrics\n        sLog->outString(\"Performance\
      \ monitoring active - collecting data\");\n    } else {\n        // Skip performance\
      \ logging\n        sLog->outString(\"Performance monitoring inactive\");\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other performance monitoring
    APIs to provide comprehensive bot system analysis. The enable/disable state may
    be controlled through configuration files or runtime commands. The implementation
    likely involves a simple boolean flag check for performance efficiency.
