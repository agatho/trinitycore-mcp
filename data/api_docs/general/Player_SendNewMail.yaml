  brief: Sends a new mail message to the player's mailbox.
  description: This method is responsible for sending a new mail message to the player's
    mailbox in the World of Warcraft client. It typically handles the process of creating
    and dispatching mail messages, including setting up the necessary data structures
    such as mail templates, attachments, and recipient information. The method ensures
    that the mail is properly formatted and sent according to game mechanics rules,
    which may include handling of item attachments, money, and other mail components.
    This method is part of the player's internal mail system and usually invoked when
    a player needs to receive mail from another player or NPC.

    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when mail needs
    to be sent to a player. It may involve multiple internal steps including setting
    up mail templates, handling attachments, and sending notifications to the player's
    mailbox. Performance considerations include potential delays if the mail system
    is overloaded or if there are issues with mail delivery.
  warnings: This method should not be called directly by external code unless explicitly
    required. The method is intended for internal use within the game engine and may
    cause issues if invoked improperly. Care should be taken to ensure that mail templates
    and attachments are properly configured before calling this method.
