  method: LoadMountDatabase
  signature: void MountManager::LoadMountDatabase()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes and loads the mount database into memory for use by the MountManager.
  description: The LoadMountDatabase method is responsible for initializing and loading
    all mount-related data from the game's database into memory. This method typically
    executes during server startup or when the mount system needs to be refreshed.
    It reads mount definitions, their associated spells, requirements, and other properties
    from the database tables such as 'mounts', 'spell_template', and related lookup
    tables. The loaded data is then stored in internal caches within the MountManager
    class for fast access during player interactions. This method ensures that all
    available mounts are properly registered and ready for players to acquire and
    use through the game's mount system.

  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage During Server Initialization
    code: "void WorldServer::InitializeMountSystem()\n{\n    sMountMgr->LoadMountDatabase();\n\
      \    // Mount data is now available for player use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    mount data needs to be refreshed. It performs database queries and loads significant
    amounts of data, so it may cause temporary performance impact. The method assumes
    that the database connection is already established and functional.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times without proper cleanup can lead to
    memory leaks or duplicate entries in internal caches. Do not invoke this method
    from within high-frequency loops or player interaction handlers as it may block
    other operations.
