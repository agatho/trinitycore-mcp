  class: MovementGenerator
  method: Reset
  signature: void MovementGenerator::Reset(Unit * owner)
documentation:
  brief: Resets the movement generator state for the specified unit, clearing any
    active movement behaviors and restoring default movement settings.
  description: The Reset method is used to clear the current movement behavior of
    a Unit controlled by this MovementGenerator. It typically resets internal state
    variables and may stop any ongoing movement operations such as pathfinding or
    follow movements. This method is commonly invoked when switching between different
    movement types, during unit reinitialization, or when a movement needs to be interrupted
    and restarted from a clean state. The operation ensures that the Unit's movement
    system is in a consistent state before applying new movement instructions.
  parameters:
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Unit object whose movement generator state will be
      reset. This parameter must not be null and should reference a valid Unit instance
      within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Reset Movement Generator for a Player
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nMovementGenerator* mg = player->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\n\
      if (mg)\n{\n    mg->Reset(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Reset Movement Generator Before Applying New Behavior
    code: "Unit* unit = ...;\nunit->GetMotionMaster()->Clear(false); // Clear existing\
      \ movements\nunit->GetMotionMaster()->MoveIdle(); // Start idle movement\n//\
      \ Or reset a specific generator before reinitializing it\nMovementGenerator*\
      \ mg = unit->GetMotionMaster()->GetCurrentMovementGenerator();\nif (mg)\n{\n\
      \    mg->Reset(unit);\n    // Reinitialize with new behavior\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the MotionMaster class when
    switching movement generators or during unit cleanup. It does not directly modify
    the Unit's position or orientation but rather resets its internal movement state
    machine. Developers should ensure that the owner parameter points to a valid and
    alive Unit object to avoid undefined behavior.
  warnings: Calling Reset on a null owner pointer will result in a crash. Always verify
    that the Unit exists before calling this method. Additionally, resetting a MovementGenerator
    while it is actively processing movement may cause unexpected behavior if not
    synchronized properly with the game loop.
