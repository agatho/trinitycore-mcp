  class: DungeonBehavior
  method: CoordinateCrowdControl
  signature: void DungeonBehavior::CoordinateCrowdControl(Group * group, const int
    & targets)
documentation:
  brief: Coordinates crowd control effects for a group within a dungeon environment.
  description: The CoordinateCrowdControl method manages and synchronizes crowd control
    mechanics across all members of a specified group during dungeon encounters. This
    method ensures that crowd control abilities are properly applied, tracked, and
    resolved according to game rules and encounter mechanics. It handles the coordination
    between different player actions and environmental effects to maintain proper
    gameplay balance and prevent conflicts in control over targets. The method typically
    operates within the context of a dungeon's AI behavior system and may interact
    with other group management functions.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who will be subject
      to crowd control coordination. Must not be null and should represent an active
      dungeon group.
  - name: targets
    description: Reference to an integer specifying the number of targets that should
      be affected by crowd control effects. This value determines how many enemies
      or players will receive the control effects.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Dungeon Encounter
    code: 'Group* dungeonGroup = player->GetGroup();

      int targetCount = 3;

      DungeonBehavior behavior;

      behavior.CoordinateCrowdControl(dungeonGroup, targetCount);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Target Count Based on Difficulty
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nint targets = 0;\nif (difficulty ==\
      \ DUNGEON_DIFFICULTY_HEROIC) {\n    targets = 5;\n} else {\n    targets = 3;\n\
      }\nDungeonBehavior behavior;\nbehavior.CoordinateCrowdControl(group, targets);"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with TrinityCore's group management and combat
    systems. It may involve synchronization points to ensure all players in the group
    receive consistent crowd control state updates. The implementation might include
    checks for player validity, group membership, and encounter state.
  warnings: Ensure that the Group pointer is valid before calling this method to prevent
    null pointer exceptions. The target count should be within reasonable bounds to
    avoid unexpected behavior or performance issues with large numbers of controlled
    entities.
