  method: SetArenaMatchmakerRating
  signature: void Battleground::SetArenaMatchmakerRating(int team, int MMR)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the matchmaker rating for a specific team in an arena battleground.
  description: 'The SetArenaMatchmakerRating method updates the matchmaker rating
    (MMR) for a specified team within an arena battleground. This rating is used by
    the matchmaking system to balance teams and determine appropriate opponents. The
    method accepts two parameters: the team identifier and the new MMR value. It''s
    typically called during arena matchmaking or when adjusting player ratings after
    a match. This function directly modifies internal battleground state related to
    player matchmaking statistics.'
  parameters:
  - name: team
    description: The team identifier (0 for Alliance, 1 for Horde) whose matchmaker
      rating will be updated.
  - name: MMR
    description: The new matchmaker rating value to assign to the specified team.
      Should be a positive integer representing the player's skill level in matchmaking.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Alliance Team MMR
    code: 'Battleground* bg = sObjectMgr->GetBattleground(12345);

      bg->SetArenaMatchmakerRating(0, 1800); // Set Alliance team MMR to 1800'
    language: cpp
  - title: Update Horde Team Rating
    code: "if (Battleground* bg = player->GetBattleground())\n{\n    if (bg->IsArena())\n\
      \    {\n        bg->SetArenaMatchmakerRating(1, 2100); // Update Horde team\
      \ MMR\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies internal battleground state and should only
    be called when the battleground is in a valid state for rating updates. The matchmaker
    rating affects how players are matched against each other in future arena games.
    This function does not validate the MMR value range or perform any sanity checks
    on input.
  warnings: Calling this method outside of appropriate battleground states may lead
    to inconsistent matchmaking behavior. Ensure that team identifiers are valid (0
    or 1) and that MMR values are reasonable for the game's rating system. Incorrect
    usage can cause players to be matched against inappropriate opponents.
