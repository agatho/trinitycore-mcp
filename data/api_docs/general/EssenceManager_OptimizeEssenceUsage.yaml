documentation:
  brief: Optimizes essence usage by redistributing or consolidating essence resources
    within the player's inventory.
  description: The OptimizeEssenceUsage method is responsible for managing and optimizing
    the distribution of essence resources in a player's inventory. This method typically
    evaluates the current state of essence holdings, identifies opportunities to consolidate
    smaller essence stacks into larger ones, or redistribute essence to maximize efficiency.
    It may also handle the conversion of lower-tier essence into higher-tier essence
    where beneficial, or ensure that essence is properly allocated for crafting, enchanting,
    or other gameplay activities. The optimization process considers factors such
    as stack sizes, essence types, and available storage capacity. This method is
    generally invoked during specific game events, player actions, or periodic maintenance
    routines to maintain an efficient essence inventory state.

    essence transactions to maintain optimal resource allocation.
