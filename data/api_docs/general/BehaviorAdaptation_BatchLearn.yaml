api:
  class: BehaviorAdaptation
  method: BatchLearn
  signature: void BehaviorAdaptation::BatchLearn(uint32_t botGuid, size_t batchSize)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates batch learning process for a bot with specified GUID and batch
    size.
  description: The BatchLearn method is responsible for triggering a learning sequence
    within the BehaviorAdaptation system for a specific bot identified by its GUID.
    It processes a defined number of learning iterations or data points as specified
    by the batchSize parameter. This functionality is typically used in AI-driven
    bot behavior adaptation where multiple learning steps are performed in a single
    operation to improve decision-making capabilities. The method operates on the
    assumption that the bot has been properly initialized and registered within the
    system before this call is made.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: Unique identifier (GUID) of the bot that will undergo batch learning
      process. Must correspond to an existing bot in the system.
  - name: batchSize
    description: Number of learning iterations or data points to process in this batch.
      Should be a positive integer value representing the size of the learning batch.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Batch Learning Usage
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      uint32_t botGuid = 12345;

      size_t batchSize = 100;

      adaptation.BatchLearn(botGuid, batchSize);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Batch Learning with Dynamic Batch Size
    code: 'BehaviorAdaptation adaptation;

      uint32_t botGuid = 67890;

      size_t batchSize = GetOptimalBatchSize();

      adaptation.BatchLearn(botGuid, batchSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs asynchronous operations internally and may queue
    learning tasks for processing. It's recommended to ensure the bot is in a valid
    state before calling this method. The actual learning process might involve multiple
    internal steps including data collection, model updates, and behavior adjustments.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid botGuid may result in undefined behavior
    or system errors. Ensure that batchSize is within reasonable limits to prevent
    performance degradation or memory issues during batch processing.
