api:
  class: AuctionHouse
  method: GetSimilarAuctions
  signature: int AuctionHouse::GetSimilarAuctions(uint32 itemId, uint32 maxResults)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a list of auctions for items similar to the specified item ID from
    the auction house.
  description: The GetSimilarAuctions method queries the auction house database to
    find auctions for items that are considered similar to the provided item ID. This
    functionality is typically used in World of Warcraft's auction house system to
    suggest alternative items when a player searches for a specific item. The method
    returns the number of similar auctions found and populates an internal data structure
    with the results. It may consider factors such as item class, subclass, quality,
    and other item properties to determine similarity. This method is part of the
    core auction house logic and is essential for providing relevant search results
    to players.
  parameters:
  - name: itemId
    description: The unique identifier of the item for which similar auctions should
      be found. This corresponds to the item's entry in the item_template database
      table.
  - name: maxResults
    description: The maximum number of similar auction results to retrieve. This parameter
      limits the number of entries returned to prevent excessive data transfer or
      processing.
  returns: Returns an integer representing the number of similar auctions found and
    added to the internal result set. A return value of 0 indicates no similar auctions
    were found, while a positive integer indicates the count of matching auctions.
  examples:
  - title: Find Similar Auctions for a Common Item
    code: "AuctionHouse auctionHouse;\nuint32 itemId = 18796; // Example: Minor Mana\
      \ Potion\nuint32 maxResults = 10;\nint resultCount = auctionHouse.GetSimilarAuctions(itemId,\
      \ maxResults);\nif (resultCount > 0) {\n    printf(\"Found %d similar auctions\\\
      n\", resultCount);\n} else {\n    printf(\"No similar auctions found\\n\");\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Find Similar Auctions with Error Handling
    code: "AuctionHouse auctionHouse;\nuint32 itemId = 45678; // Example: Enchanted\
      \ Thorium Bar\nuint32 maxResults = 5;\nint resultCount = auctionHouse.GetSimilarAuctions(itemId,\
      \ maxResults);\nif (resultCount < 0) {\n    printf(\"Error occurred while fetching\
      \ similar auctions\\n\");\n} else if (resultCount == 0) {\n    printf(\"No similar\
      \ items found for item ID %u\\n\", itemId);\n} else {\n    printf(\"Retrieved\
      \ %d similar auctions for item %u\\n\", resultCount, itemId);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database queries to find items with similar properties.
    It may cache results or use indexing strategies to improve performance. The 'similarity'
    criteria are determined by the auction house implementation and could involve
    item class, subclass, quality, and other attributes. The internal data structure
    used to store results should be accessed through dedicated getter methods.
  warnings: The method assumes valid itemId and maxResults parameters. Passing invalid
    item IDs may result in no matches or undefined behavior. The maxResults parameter
    should be bounded to prevent excessive memory allocation or processing time. This
    method is likely not thread-safe and should be called from a context where auction
    house state is consistent.
