  method: Shutdown
  signature: void BotPriorityManager::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the bot priority manager, cleaning up all active bot priorities
    and associated resources.
  description: The Shutdown method terminates the operation of the BotPriorityManager
    by releasing all allocated resources and clearing internal data structures related
    to bot priorities. This method ensures that no memory leaks occur and that all
    bot-related priority configurations are properly disposed of before the manager
    is destroyed. It should be called during server shutdown or when the bot system
    needs to be temporarily disabled. The method performs cleanup operations in a
    thread-safe manner, ensuring that concurrent access to the manager is prevented
    during shutdown.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'BotPriorityManager* manager = BotPriorityManager::Instance();

      manager->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked automatically during server shutdown sequences.
    It's important to ensure no other threads are actively using the BotPriorityManager
    before calling Shutdown to avoid race conditions. The method internally handles
    synchronization to prevent concurrent access.
