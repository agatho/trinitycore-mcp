  method: GetQuestTurnInLocation
  signature: int QuestTurnIn::GetQuestTurnInLocation(uint32 questId)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the quest turn-in location identifier for a specified quest ID.
  description: The GetQuestTurnInLocation method is used to obtain the unique identifier
    of the location where a player must turn in a specific quest. This identifier
    typically corresponds to a game object or NPC that serves as the quest completion
    target. The method is commonly used within the TrinityCore framework to determine
    where players should interact with game objects or NPCs to complete quests. It
    may internally query the database or quest system to retrieve this information,
    and it's often called during quest validation or turn-in processing. This functionality
    is essential for proper quest flow mechanics in World of Warcraft emulation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the quest turn-in location identifier (typically
    a GameObject GUID or NPC entry ID). A return value of 0 usually indicates that
    no valid turn-in location was found for the specified quest, which may happen
    if the quest data is missing or invalid in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "uint32 questId = 12345;\nint turnInLocation = questTurnIn->GetQuestTurnInLocation(questId);\n\
      if (turnInLocation != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with quest turn-in logic\n    //\
      \ Use turnInLocation to determine where to send player\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs database lookups and should be used judiciously
    in performance-critical code paths. The returned value is typically used to identify
    the specific GameObject or NPC that must be interacted with to complete a quest.
    It's recommended to cache this value if it's accessed frequently for the same
    quest.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying the quest ID exists,
    as returning 0 may indicate either no turn-in location or an invalid quest ID.
    Always validate the return value before proceeding with quest completion logic.
