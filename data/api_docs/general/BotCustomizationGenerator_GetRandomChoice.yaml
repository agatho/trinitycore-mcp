  method: GetRandomChoice
  signature: uint32 BotCustomizationGenerator::GetRandomChoice(const int & choices)
documentation:
  brief: Selects and returns a random choice from a predefined set of customization
    options for bot characters.
  description: The GetRandomChoice method is designed to randomly select one option
    from a collection of possible customizations for bot characters within the TrinityCore
    framework. This functionality is typically used during the creation or modification
    of bot NPCs to ensure variation in their appearance. The method operates on an
    internal set of choices defined by the class and returns a single uint32 value
    representing the selected customization. It's commonly employed in conjunction
    with other bot generation utilities to create diverse and randomized bot appearances
    that enhance gameplay immersion.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the randomly selected customization choice
    from the internal choices set. The specific meaning of this value depends on the
    context in which it is used, typically corresponding to an index or identifier
    for a particular customization option such as skin tone, facial features, or hair
    style.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 selectedChoice = botCustomizationGenerator.GetRandomChoice();

      // Use selectedChoice to apply a random customization to a bot character'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on a pseudo-random number generator and may be influenced
    by the current state of the system's random seed. It is intended for use during
    bot initialization or customization phases and should not be called excessively
    in performance-critical sections of code.
  warnings: Ensure that the internal choices set has been properly initialized before
    calling this method, as calling it without valid data may result in undefined
    behavior or incorrect selections.
