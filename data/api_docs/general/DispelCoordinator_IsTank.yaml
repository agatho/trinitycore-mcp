  signature: bool DispelCoordinator::IsTank(Unit * unit) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the specified unit is classified as a tank in the context
    of dispel coordination.
  description: The IsTank method evaluates whether a given Unit object is considered
    a tank for the purposes of dispel coordination logic. This typically involves
    checking if the unit is actively tanking (aggro) or has tanking responsibilities
    within a group or encounter. The method may consider factors such as threat level,
    role assignment, or specific tanking mechanics relevant to the TrinityCore framework.
    It's commonly used in AI behavior systems where certain actions like dispelling
    debuffs are prioritized based on who is currently holding aggro.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is classified as a tank; otherwise returns false.
    A unit may be considered a tank if it has high threat, is actively holding aggro,
    or meets other criteria defined by the dispel coordination system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if target is a tank
    code: "if (dispelCoordinator.IsTank(targetUnit)) {\n    // Perform tank-specific\
      \ dispel logic\n    DoTankDispel(targetUnit);\n} else {\n    // Handle non-tank\
      \ unit\n    DoGeneralDispel(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal threat tables and group role assignments.
    It's important to note that a unit may not always be explicitly marked as a tank,
    but could still return true if it meets the criteria for being a primary threat
    target.
  warnings: Ensure that the Unit pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior. The method might not account for all
    edge cases in complex encounter mechanics where multiple units are actively tanking
    or when role assignments change dynamically.
