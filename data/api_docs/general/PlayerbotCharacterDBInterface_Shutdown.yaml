  class: PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Shuts down the player bot character database interface, cleaning up resources
    and terminating active connections.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for gracefully terminating the PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface,
    ensuring all active database connections are properly closed and any pending operations
    are completed or canceled. This method typically gets invoked during server shutdown
    or when a player bot instance needs to be destroyed. It performs cleanup tasks
    such as releasing memory, closing database handles, and ensuring no dangling references
    remain in the system. The interface should not be used after calling this method,
    as it may lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface* dbInterface = new PlayerbotCharacterDBInterface();

      // ... perform operations ...

      dbInterface->Shutdown();

      delete dbInterface;'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore framework during
    server shutdown or when a player bot is removed from the game world. It's important
    to ensure that no other threads are actively using the interface before calling
    Shutdown to avoid race conditions.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown on an already shut down interface may result in undefined
    behavior. Always verify that the interface is still active before invoking this
    method.
