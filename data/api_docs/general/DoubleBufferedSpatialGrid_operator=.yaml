documentation:
  brief: Moves the contents of another DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid instance to this
    instance.
  description: The move assignment operator transfers ownership of resources from
    the source DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid object to the current object. This operation
    is typically used to efficiently transfer the internal state and data structures
    of one spatial grid container to another without performing expensive deep copies.
    The source object is left in a valid but unspecified state after the move operation.
    In the context of TrinityCore's spatial grid system, this method supports efficient
    management of game object positioning and spatial queries within the world environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid instance, allowing
    for chaining of assignment operations.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid grid1;

      DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid grid2 = std::move(grid1); // Move assignment

      // grid1 is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Chaining Move Assignments
    code: 'DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid grid1, grid2, grid3;

      grid3 = std::move(grid2) = std::move(grid1); // Chained move assignments

      // grid1 and grid2 are left in valid but unspecified states'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a move operation rather than a copy, making it more
    efficient for large spatial grid structures. The moved-from object remains valid
    but its contents are unspecified. This is particularly useful in performance-critical
    systems like TrinityCore's world object management where minimizing memory allocation
    and copying overhead is essential.
  warnings: After calling this move assignment operator, the source object should
    not be used in any operations that depend on its previous state. The behavior
    of using the moved-from object is undefined, though it remains in a valid state
    for subsequent move operations or destruction.
