documentation:
  brief: Clears the player's update mask, removing all updates from the client.
  description: The ClearUpdateMask method removes all pending updates from a Player
    object's update mask, effectively resetting the player's state to ensure no stale
    or outdated data is sent to the client. This method is typically used during player
    initialization or when resetting the player's update state before sending new
    updates. The method ensures that any previously set update fields are cleared
    and prevents potential issues with data synchronization between server and client.
    It is particularly important in scenarios where a player's update mask needs to
    be reset for gameplay mechanics such as zoning, character creation, or when updating
    player attributes.

  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->ClearUpdateMask(true);

      // Player''s update mask is now cleared'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully during player initialization or when
    resetting update states, as clearing the update mask may cause issues if not properly
    handled. It is recommended to call this method before setting new updates to avoid
    conflicts with existing update data.
  warnings: Improper use of ClearUpdateMask can lead to synchronization issues between
    server and client, potentially causing visual artifacts or incorrect player state
    information in-game.
