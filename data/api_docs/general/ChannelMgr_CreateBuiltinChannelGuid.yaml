  class: ChannelMgr
  method: CreateBuiltinChannelGuid
  signature: int ChannelMgr::CreateBuiltinChannelGuid(uint32 channelId, const AreaTableEntry
    * zoneEntry) const
documentation:
  brief: Creates and returns a unique GUID for a builtin channel based on the provided
    channel ID and zone entry.
  description: The CreateBuiltinChannelGuid method generates a unique identifier (GUID)
    for a builtin channel within the TrinityCore framework. This method is typically
    used when initializing or managing built-in channels such as those associated
    with specific zones or areas in the game world. The GUID created is based on the
    provided channelId and zoneEntry parameters, ensuring that each builtin channel
    has a distinct identifier. The method is marked as const, indicating it does not
    modify any member variables of the ChannelMgr class. This functionality supports
    the internal channel management system used by TrinityCore to maintain unique
    identifiers for various in-game communication channels.
  parameters:
  - name: channelId
    description: The numeric identifier for the channel type. This value typically
      corresponds to predefined channel types such as general, trade, or local defense
      channels.
  - name: zoneEntry
    description: A pointer to an AreaTableEntry structure that defines the zone or
      area associated with this channel. The zone entry contains information about
      the geographical area where the channel is active.
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the unique GUID assigned to the builtin
    channel. A negative value may indicate an error condition, while a positive value
    represents a valid GUID.
  examples:
  - title: Creating a builtin channel GUID for a general zone
    code: "uint32 channelId = 1; // General channel\nAreaTableEntry* zoneEntry = sAreaTableStore.LookupEntry(1234);\
      \ // Example zone ID\nint guid = channelMgr->CreateBuiltinChannelGuid(channelId,\
      \ zoneEntry);\nif (guid > 0)\n{\n    // Successfully created a valid GUID\n\
      \    printf(\"Created builtin channel GUID: %d\\n\", guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal channel management system and should
    not be called directly by external modules unless implementing custom channel
    behavior. The method relies on internal data structures and may throw exceptions
    if invalid parameters are passed. It's recommended to validate input parameters
    before calling this method.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for zoneEntry or an invalid channelId may result
    in undefined behavior or error conditions. Ensure that the zoneEntry points to
    a valid AreaTableEntry structure, and channelId corresponds to a recognized builtin
    channel type.
