documentation:
  brief: Moves the taxi path data from one PlayerTaxi object to another.
  description: The operator= method performs a move assignment of taxi path data from
    another PlayerTaxi object. This is a move operation that transfers ownership of
    the internal taxi path data from the source object (other) to the current object,
    leaving the source object in a valid but unspecified state. In the context of
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore, this method is used to efficiently transfer taxi
    route information between player instances without unnecessary copying. The operation
    is typically used during object initialization or when reassigning taxi path data
    to different player instances.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the current PlayerTaxi object after the move assignment
    has been completed, enabling method chaining.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Move Assignment
    code: 'PlayerTaxi sourceTaxi;

      // ... populate sourceTaxi with taxi path data ...

      PlayerTaxi targetTaxi = std::move(sourceTaxi); // Uses operator=

      // sourceTaxi is now in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  - title: Method Chaining After Move
    code: 'PlayerTaxi taxi1, taxi2;

      // ... populate taxi1 with data ...

      taxi2 = std::move(taxi1); // Move assignment

      // taxi2 now contains the path data from taxi1

      // taxi1 is left in a valid but unspecified state'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method implements move semantics, which is more efficient than copy
    semantics for transferring large data structures. The source object after move
    assignment should not be used until reinitialized or reassigned. This operation
    is typically used internally by the TrinityCore framework when managing player
    taxi path state during character loading, saving, or transfer operations.
  warnings: After calling this operator, the source PlayerTaxi object should not be
    accessed or used in any way that might cause undefined behavior. The object will
    be left in a valid but unspecified state, and attempting to use it may result
    in crashes or data corruption.
