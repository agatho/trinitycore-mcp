documentation:
  brief: Initializes and registers all Battle for Azeroth mounts within the MountManager
    system.
  description: The InitializeBfAMounts method is responsible for setting up and registering
    all Battle for Azeroth (BfA) related mounts within the MountManager subsystem.
    This method ensures that all applicable mount entries from the Battle for Azeroth
    expansion are properly initialized and made available for player acquisition,
    display, and usage within the game environment. The method typically runs during
    server initialization or mount system setup to ensure that all BfA content is
    correctly integrated into the existing mount management framework. It handles
    the registration of new mount entries, sets appropriate flags, and ensures compatibility
    with the current expansion's mount mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'MountManager* mountMgr = sObjectAccessor->GetMountManager();

      mountMgr->InitializeBfAMounts();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during server initialization or when
    expanding the mount database. It is typically invoked automatically by the MountManager
    constructor or during expansion-specific setup routines. The method may perform
    database operations to register new mounts and could potentially impact performance
    during server startup.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times may result in duplicate mount entries
    or unexpected behavior. Ensure that this method is only executed once during proper
    initialization phases to avoid conflicts with existing mount data.
