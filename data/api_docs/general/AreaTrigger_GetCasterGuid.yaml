  method: GetCasterGuid
  signature: const int & AreaTrigger::GetCasterGuid() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the GUID of the unit that cast the area trigger.
  description: The GetCasterGuid method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of
    the unit responsible for creating or casting the area trigger. This GUID typically
    corresponds to a player, creature, or game object that initiated the trigger.
    The returned value is a const reference to an integer representing the GUID, which
    can be used to identify and interact with the caster within the TrinityCore framework.
    This method is commonly used in spell and aura handling systems where the origin
    of an area trigger needs to be tracked for effects, targeting, or event processing.
  parameters: []
  returns: A const reference to an integer representing the GUID of the unit that
    cast the area trigger. The GUID uniquely identifies the caster within the game
    world and can be used to retrieve the corresponding GameObject, Creature, or Player
    object.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to identify the caster
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nObjectGuid casterGuid = trigger->GetCasterGuid();\n\
      if (!casterGuid.IsPlayer())\n{\n    // Handle non-player caster\n}\nelse\n{\n\
      \    Player* player = ObjectAccessor::FindPlayer(casterGuid);\n    if (player)\n\
      \    {\n        // Process player-specific logic\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned GUID may be invalid or null if the area trigger was not cast
    by a valid unit. It's recommended to verify the GUID before using it to access
    objects from the ObjectAccessor. This method is thread-safe as long as the AreaTrigger
    object itself is accessed in a thread-safe manner.
  warnings: Be cautious when using the returned GUID without verifying its validity,
    as invalid GUIDs may lead to crashes or undefined behavior when attempting to
    retrieve objects from the game world. Always ensure proper null checks before
    dereferencing the GUID.
