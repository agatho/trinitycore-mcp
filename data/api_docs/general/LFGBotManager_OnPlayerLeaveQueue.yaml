  class: LFGBotManager
  method: OnPlayerLeaveQueue
  signature: void LFGBotManager::OnPlayerLeaveQueue(int playerGuid)
documentation:
  brief: Handles the removal of a player from the LFG queue when they leave.
  description: The OnPlayerLeaveQueue method is invoked when a player removes themselves
    from the Looking for Group (LFG) queue. This method manages the internal state
    of the LFGBotManager to ensure that the player is properly removed from any active
    group or queue tracking. It may also trigger cleanup operations such as updating
    group member counts, notifying other players, or resetting relevant timers. The
    method ensures that the LFG system maintains accurate data about player availability
    and group composition.
  parameters:
  - name: playerGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the player who is leaving the LFG
      queue. This value must be a valid player GUID within the TrinityCore database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Player Logout Handler
    code: "void HandlePlayerLogout(Player* player)\n{\n    LFGBotManager::Instance()->OnPlayerLeaveQueue(player->GetGUID().GetCounter());\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Custom LFG System Hook
    code: "void CustomLFGSystem::OnPlayerLeaveQueue(uint32 playerGuid)\n{\n    //\
      \ Perform custom logic before calling base implementation\n    sLFGBotManager->OnPlayerLeaveQueue(playerGuid);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup or notification logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called whenever a player explicitly leaves the LFG
    queue, such as through UI interaction or system events like logout. It is important
    to ensure that player GUIDs passed to this method are valid and correspond to
    existing players in the database to avoid unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Do not call this method with invalid or non-existent player GUIDs as it
    may lead to undefined behavior or data corruption within the LFG system. Ensure
    proper synchronization if this method is called from multiple threads.
