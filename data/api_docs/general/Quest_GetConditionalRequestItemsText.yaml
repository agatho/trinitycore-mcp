  signature: const int & Quest::GetConditionalRequestItemsText() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the conditional request items text for a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the conditional request items text associated
    with a specific quest, which is used to display the appropriate text when players
    are required to fulfill certain conditions before accepting or completing the
    quest. The text typically represents the requirements that must be met for the
    quest to proceed, such as collecting specific items or achieving certain objectives.
    This method is part of the quest system's conditional logic and helps maintain
    game balance by ensuring proper quest progression mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the conditional request items text as an integer value representing
    the identifier for the quest's conditional requirements text, which can be used
    to retrieve the actual text from the database or localization tables.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "int textId = quest->GetConditionalRequestItemsText();\nif (textId > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Use textId to fetch localized text\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the appropriate conditional text for quests. It should be called
    only when the quest's conditional requirements have been properly initialized.
  warnings: This method may return zero if no conditional request items text exists
    for the quest, indicating that there are no conditions required for the quest
    to proceed. Be sure to check for zero values before proceeding with any logic
    involving this text.
