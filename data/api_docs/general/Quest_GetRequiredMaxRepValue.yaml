documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum reputation value required to complete a quest.
  description: This method retrieves the maximum reputation value that is required
    for a player to be able to complete a specific quest. It is used in conjunction
    with the quest's reputation requirements to determine whether a player has sufficient
    reputation to finish the quest. The returned value represents the upper limit
    of reputation points needed for quest completion, typically associated with a
    faction or group of factions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer representing the maximum reputation value required to
    complete the quest. This value is usually expressed in terms of reputation points
    and can be used to determine if a player's current reputation level meets or exceeds
    the required threshold for quest completion.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 maxRep = quest->GetRequiredMaxRepValue();\nif (maxRep > 0)\n{\n \
      \   // Player can complete the quest\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Quest cannot be completed\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other reputation-related
    methods such as GetRequiredMinRepValue() and GetReputationReward(). It may return
    zero if the quest does not require reputation for completion, or negative values
    if the quest requires a specific reputation level to be met.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method in combination with other reputation-based
    functions. The value returned may vary depending on the quest's design and faction
    requirements. Ensure that the player's current reputation level is properly checked
    before calling this method to avoid incorrect results.
