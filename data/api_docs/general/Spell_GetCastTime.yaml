  class: Spell
  method: GetCastTime
  signature: int32 Spell::GetCastTime() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the cast time in milliseconds of the spell.
  description: The GetCastTime method retrieves the total casting time duration for
    a spell, measured in milliseconds. This value represents the time required to
    complete the spell's casting process, including any delays or modifiers that may
    affect the casting speed. The method is commonly used in spell mechanics to determine
    when a spell will finish casting and become available for use again. It typically
    returns zero for instant spells or positive values for spells with a casting time.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value representing the cast time in milliseconds. A
    value of zero indicates an instant cast, while positive values indicate the duration
    required to complete the spell's casting process.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "int32 castTime = spell->GetCastTime();\nif (castTime > 0)\n{\n    // Spell\
      \ has a casting time\n    // Do something with the cast time\n}\nelse\n{\n \
      \   // Spell is instant\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other spell-related functions
    to determine if a spell is ready for use. The value returned may be affected by
    various factors such as haste modifiers, spell effects, or player state. Implementation
    details include checking whether the spell has a casting time or is instant before
    calling this method.
  warnings: This method should not be called during spell execution or when the spell
    is already in progress, as it may return incorrect values due to timing issues.
    Also, the value returned might vary based on game mechanics and player state,
    so ensure proper context when using this method.
