  method: IsRefundable
  signature: bool Item::IsRefundable() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item can be refunded to the player.
  description: This method checks if the item is eligible for refund, which typically
    applies to items purchased from vendors or those that have not been used or consumed.
    The method returns true if the item can be refunded, false otherwise. Items that
    are refundable usually have a limited time period during which they can be returned
    to the vendor or player, and this method helps determine if that refund eligibility
    is still active. This functionality is crucial for game mechanics involving item
    management and player transactions.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is refundable, false otherwise. The return value
    indicates whether the item can be refunded to the player based on its current
    state and properties.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(12345);\nif (item && item->IsRefundable())\
      \ {\n    // Item can be refunded\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: Implementation details include checking the item's state, whether it has
    been used or consumed, and if it is within the refund window. Performance considerations
    are minimal as this method involves simple checks on item properties.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine refund eligibility for items
    that have already been used or consumed. Items that are already in use may not
    be refundable even if they appear refundable.
