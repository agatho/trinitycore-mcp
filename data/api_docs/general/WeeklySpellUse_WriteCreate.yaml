  class: WeeklySpellUse
  method: WriteCreate
  signature: void WeeklySpellUse::WriteCreate(ByteBuffer & data, const Player * owner,
    const Player * receiver) const
documentation:
  brief: Serializes weekly spell use data into a packet buffer for transmission to
    players.
  description: The WriteCreate method serializes the weekly spell use data into a
    ByteBuffer, preparing it for network transmission to either the owner or receiver
    player. This method is typically used when sending weekly spell usage information
    over the network protocol, ensuring that the data is properly formatted and encoded
    according to TrinityCore's packet structure conventions. The serialized data includes
    relevant spell use statistics and timing information that should be synchronized
    between client and server.
  parameters:
  - name: data
    description: Reference to a ByteBuffer where the serialized weekly spell use data
      will be written.
  - name: owner
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the owner of the weekly
      spell use data.
  - name: receiver
    description: Pointer to the Player object who will receive the serialized packet
      data.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in packet creation
    code: 'ByteBuffer data;

      Player* owner = ...;

      Player* receiver = ...;

      weeklySpellUse.WriteCreate(data, owner, receiver);

      // Send data to receiver''s connection'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the packet serialization system and should only be
    called when preparing data for network transmission. The method assumes that the
    provided player pointers are valid and not null. It is typically invoked during
    packet construction phases in the game's networking layer.
  warnings: Ensure that both owner and receiver player pointers are valid before calling
    this method, as dereferencing invalid pointers will result in undefined behavior.
    This method does not perform any validation on the input parameters beyond basic
    pointer checks.
