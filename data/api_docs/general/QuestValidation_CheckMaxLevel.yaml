  method: CheckMaxLevel
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CheckMaxLevel(const Quest * quest, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player can accept a quest based on their level relative to the
    quest's maximum level requirement.
  description: The CheckMaxLevel method evaluates whether a given player is within
    the acceptable level range to accept a specific quest. It compares the player's
    current level against the quest's maximum level constraint, returning true if
    the player's level is less than or equal to the quest's max level, and false otherwise.
    This validation ensures that players do not attempt to take on quests that are
    too advanced for their character level, maintaining game balance and progression
    integrity. The method is typically used during quest acceptance checks in the
    TrinityCore framework.
  parameters:
  - name: quest
    description: Pointer to the Quest object being validated. Must not be null.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object whose level is being checked against
      the quest's max level requirement. Must not be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player's level is less than or equal to the quest's
    maximum level requirement; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Level Validation
    code: "Quest* quest = sObjectMgr->GetQuestTemplate(12345);\nPlayer* player = ...;\
      \ // Valid player object\nbool canAccept = QuestValidation::CheckMaxLevel(quest,\
      \ player);\nif (canAccept)\n{\n    // Player can accept the quest\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal quest template data and player level information.
    It does not perform any additional checks such as quest completion status or other
    prerequisites. The check is purely based on level constraints.
