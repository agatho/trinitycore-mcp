  class: BaselineRotationManager
  method: TryCastAbility
  signature: bool BaselineRotationManager::TryCastAbility(int * bot, int * target,
    const BaselineAbility & ability)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to cast a specified ability using the bot and target parameters.
  description: The TryCastAbility method is responsible for executing an attempt to
    cast a given ability within the context of a baseline rotation system. It evaluates
    whether the specified ability can be cast based on current conditions, resource
    availability, and cooldowns. The method takes in a pointer to the bot's data and
    a pointer to the target's data, along with the ability to be cast. This function
    is typically used in AI-driven combat logic where abilities are selected and executed
    according to predefined rotation strategies. It returns true if the ability was
    successfully initiated or queued for casting, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the bot's identifier or internal
      state data.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target's identifier or internal
      state data.
  - name: ability
    description: Reference to a BaselineAbility object that defines the ability to
      be cast, including its properties and behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the ability was successfully initiated or queued for casting;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "BaselineAbility ability;\nability.id = 12345;\nability.cooldown = 0;\n\
      ability.cost = 50;\n\nint botId = 1;\nint targetId = 2;\nbool result = rotationManager.TryCastAbility(&botId,\
      \ &targetId, ability);\nif (result) {\n    // Ability cast successfully\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage with Cooldown Check
    code: "BaselineAbility ability;\nability.id = 12345;\nability.cooldown = 0;\n\
      ability.cost = 50;\n\nint botId = 1;\nint targetId = 2;\n\n// Ensure cooldown\
      \ is reset before attempting to cast\nif (ability.cooldown <= 0) {\n    bool\
      \ result = rotationManager.TryCastAbility(&botId, &targetId, ability);\n   \
      \ if (!result) {\n        // Handle failed cast attempt\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI decision-making loop in TrinityCore's combat
    system. The method does not directly perform the casting but rather attempts to
    initiate it, relying on underlying game mechanics for actual execution. It assumes
    valid pointers and proper initialization of the BaselineAbility object.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target parameters point to valid data before calling
    this function; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur. Also, be cautious when
    using abilities with high resource costs or long cooldowns without checking preconditions
    first.
