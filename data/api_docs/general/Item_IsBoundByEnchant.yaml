documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an item is bound by enchant.
  description: This method checks if an item is bound by enchant, which means it has
    been enchanted with a special enchantment that prevents it from being removed
    or replaced. The method returns true if the item is bound by enchantment and false
    otherwise. This functionality is crucial for understanding item behavior in World
    of Warcraft, particularly when dealing with items that have specific enchantments
    that prevent removal or replacement. Items bound by enchantment cannot be traded
    or sold to other players until they are unbound through certain game mechanics
    such as disenchanting or using a soulbound item.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item is bound by enchantment, false otherwise. The
    method does not return null or error values as it is a simple boolean check.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByGUID(123456789);\nif (item->IsBoundByEnchant())\
      \ {\n    // Item is bound by enchant\n}\nelse {\n    // Item is not bound by\
      \ enchant\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other item binding checks
    to determine the complete binding status of an item. Implementation relies on
    internal item state flags that are set when an item is enchanted with a soulbound
    enchantment.
  warnings: The method should not be confused with other binding methods like IsSoulBound
    or IsBoundByItem. This method specifically checks for enchantment-based binding,
    not item-based binding.
