  method: HasAnyEventWithFlag
  signature: bool SmartScript::HasAnyEventWithFlag(uint32 flag) const
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any event in the SmartScript has the specified flag set.
  description: The HasAnyEventWithFlag method iterates through all events associated
    with the SmartScript instance and determines whether at least one event has the
    given flag enabled. This is commonly used in World of Warcraft AI scripting to
    verify the presence of specific event configurations, such as checking for events
    that trigger on creature death or player interaction. The method performs a bitwise
    comparison against the event flags stored within each event structure. It returns
    true immediately upon finding the first matching flag, making it efficient for
    quick validation checks.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if at least one event in the SmartScript has the specified
    flag set; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check for Events with EVENT_FLAG_NOT_REPEATABLE
    code: "if (script->HasAnyEventWithFlag(EVENT_FLAG_NOT_REPEATABLE)) {\n    // Handle\
      \ logic when at least one event is non-repeatable\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Validate Script Configuration for Specific Event Types
    code: "bool hasCombatEvents = script->HasAnyEventWithFlag(EVENT_FLAG_COMBAT);\n\
      if (hasCombatEvents) {\n    // Ensure combat-related events are properly configured\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during script initialization or validation
    phases to ensure that certain event configurations exist. It does not modify any
    internal state and is safe for repeated calls. Performance is optimized by returning
    early when the first matching flag is found.
