documentation:
  brief: Destroys the SocialEventBus instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the SocialEventBus class is responsible for properly
    cleaning up all dynamically allocated memory and releasing any held resources
    when an instance of the SocialEventBus is destroyed. This method ensures that
    no memory leaks occur and that all event listeners or subscriptions are properly
    removed before the object is deallocated. In the context of TrinityCore's social
    system, this destructor may handle cleanup of player-related social events, chat
    channel subscriptions, or other social interaction data structures that were managed
    by this event bus.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of SocialEventBus instance
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    SocialEventBus* bus = new SocialEventBus();\n\
      \    // ... use the bus ...\n    delete bus; // Triggers ~SocialEventBus()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or
    is explicitly deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects are still
    referencing this SocialEventBus instance before it's destroyed, as accessing a
    destroyed object leads to undefined behavior. The cleanup process may involve
    iterating through registered event handlers and removing them from internal tracking
    structures.
  warnings: Never call the destructor manually on stack-allocated objects; let the
    compiler handle destruction automatically. Be cautious when using smart pointers
    or manual memory management with SocialEventBus instances, as improper handling
    can lead to double-deletion errors or resource leaks.
