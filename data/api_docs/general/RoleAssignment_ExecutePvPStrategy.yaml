  class: RoleAssignment
  method: ExecutePvPStrategy
  signature: void RoleAssignment::ExecutePvPStrategy(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Executes a PvP strategy for the specified group, assigning roles based on
    player capabilities and team composition.
  description: The ExecutePvPStrategy method is responsible for dynamically assigning
    roles to players within a group during PvP encounters. It evaluates each player's
    class, specialization, gear, and current combat capabilities to determine optimal
    role assignments such as tank, healer, or damage dealer. This method ensures balanced
    team composition and strategic gameplay by considering the overall group dynamics
    and enemy threat levels. The strategy execution may involve reassigning roles
    mid-combat based on changing battlefield conditions or player performance.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing players who will have their
      roles assigned. Must be a valid group with at least one member and properly
      initialized.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment Execution
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n    roleAssign.ExecutePvPStrategy(myGroup);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Role Assignment with Error Handling
    code: "Group* targetGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(12345);\nif (targetGroup &&\
      \ targetGroup->GetMembersCount() > 0)\n{\n    RoleAssignment roleAssign;\n \
      \   roleAssign.ExecutePvPStrategy(targetGroup);\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle invalid\
      \ group or empty group case\n    sLog->outError(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Invalid\
      \ or empty group for PvP strategy execution\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called during active PvP encounters when group
    composition is stable. The role assignment algorithm may modify player behavior
    through internal state changes and should not be invoked during critical combat
    sequences where immediate response is required. Performance impact is minimal
    but depends on group size and complexity of role assignments.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null or invalid group pointer will result in
    undefined behavior. Ensure that the group has valid members before calling this
    function. Avoid executing this method during high-intensity combat phases to prevent
    potential synchronization issues with player actions.
