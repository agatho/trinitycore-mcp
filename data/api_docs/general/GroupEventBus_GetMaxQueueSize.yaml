  signature: uint32 GroupEventBus::GetMaxQueueSize() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum queue size allowed for group events in the GroupEventBus.
  description: The GetMaxQueueSize method retrieves the configured maximum number
    of queued group events that can be stored within the GroupEventBus. This value
    determines how many events can be pending before new events are either dropped
    or cause the system to block, depending on the implementation details. The method
    is typically used to monitor system resource usage and ensure proper event handling
    behavior in group-based game mechanics such as raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds.
    It provides a read-only view of the internal queue limit that affects how many
    concurrent group-related events can be buffered.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of events that can be queued
    in the GroupEventBus. This value is typically configured at system initialization
    and remains constant during runtime.
  examples:
  - title: Check Maximum Queue Size
    code: 'uint32 maxSize = groupEventBus->GetMaxQueueSize();

      TC_LOG_INFO("group", "Maximum group event queue size: %u", maxSize);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and does not modify any internal state. It returns
    a cached value that reflects the configured limit, which may be set via configuration
    files or system initialization parameters.
