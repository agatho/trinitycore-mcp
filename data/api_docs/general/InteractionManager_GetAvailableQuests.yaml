  signature: int InteractionManager::GetAvailableQuests(Player * bot, int * questGiver)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the list of available quests for a bot player from a quest giver.
  description: The GetAvailableQuests method is used to fetch all quests that are
    currently available to a given bot player from a specific quest giver. This method
    typically checks the player's quest log, quest status, and any prerequisites required
    to accept or turn in quests. It returns an integer value representing the number
    of quests found, which can be zero if no quests are available. The method is commonly
    used in AI scripts or questing systems where automated bots need to determine
    what actions they can take next based on their current interaction with NPCs.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot player for which
      quests are being retrieved.
  - name: questGiver
    description: Pointer to an integer that represents the quest giver's identifier
      or type. This value is used internally to determine which NPC or quest source
      to query.
  returns: Returns an integer indicating the number of available quests for the specified
    bot player from the given quest giver. A return value of zero indicates no quests
    are available, while a positive integer indicates the count of available quests.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check available quests
    code: "int questCount = interactionManager.GetAvailableQuests(botPlayer, &questGiverId);\n\
      if (questCount > 0)\n{\n    // Process available quests\n    printf(\"Found\
      \ %d available quests\\n\", questCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal quest tracking systems and may
    require the player to be within range of the quest giver. It is typically part
    of a larger AI or automation framework used in TrinityCore-based bots.
  warnings: Ensure that both the bot player and questGiverId are properly initialized
    before calling this method, as invalid pointers could lead to undefined behavior
    or crashes.
