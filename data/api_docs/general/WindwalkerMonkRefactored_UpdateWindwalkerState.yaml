  class: WindwalkerMonkRefactored
  method: UpdateWindwalkerState
  signature: void WindwalkerMonkRefactored::UpdateWindwalkerState()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the internal state of the Windwalker Monk class based on current
    game conditions and player actions.
  description: The UpdateWindwalkerState method is responsible for managing and synchronizing
    the internal state variables of a Windwalker Monk character within the TrinityCore
    framework. This includes updating cooldowns, tracking energy levels, managing
    combo point accumulation, and ensuring proper stance transitions according to
    the Windwalker monk's gameplay mechanics. The method typically gets invoked during
    game loop updates or in response to specific player actions such as casting spells
    or performing melee attacks. It ensures that all state-related variables are accurately
    reflected based on the current game context, enabling correct behavior for abilities
    like Spinning Crane Kick, Tiger Palm, and other Windwalker-specific mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic State Update Call
    code: 'WindwalkerMonkRefactored* monk = ...;

      monk->UpdateWindwalkerState();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Game Loop
    code: "void GameLoop()\n{\n    // ... other game logic ...\n    for (auto& player\
      \ : players)\n    {\n        if (player->IsWindwalkerMonk())\n        {\n  \
      \          static_cast<WindwalkerMonkRefactored*>(player)->UpdateWindwalkerState();\n\
      \        }\n    }\n    // ... rest of game loop ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called regularly during the game update cycle to maintain
    accurate state tracking. It may internally access and modify various internal
    member variables such as energy, combo points, cooldown timers, and stance flags.
    The implementation assumes that the object is properly initialized with valid
    player context.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the WindwalkerMonkRefactored
    instance may lead to undefined behavior or crashes. Ensure that all required state
    variables are properly set before invoking this method.
