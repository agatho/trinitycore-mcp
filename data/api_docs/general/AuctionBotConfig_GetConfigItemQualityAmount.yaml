    const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the configured amount of items for a specified auction quality
    level.
  description: The GetConfigItemQualityAmount method returns the number of items that
    are configured to be listed at a specific quality level within the Auction House
    bot system. This value is typically used by the AuctionBot to determine how many
    items of each quality (common, uncommon, rare, etc.) should be auctioned at any
    given time. The method takes an AuctionQuality enum value as input and returns
    a uint32 representing the count of items for that quality. This configuration
    allows server administrators to control item distribution and pricing strategies
    within their auction house systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of items configured for the specified
    auction quality level. Returns 0 if no configuration exists for the given quality
    or if the quality parameter is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve item count for rare quality
    code: 'uint32 rareItemCount = auctionBotConfig->GetConfigItemQualityAmount(AuctionQuality::RARE);

      // Returns the configured number of rare items to be auctioned'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AuctionBot configuration system and likely reads
    from internal configuration tables or cached values. It's designed to be called
    frequently during auction house operations, so performance should be considered
    in high-traffic environments.
