  method: GetSpellCastTime
  signature: uint32 CombatSpecializationBase::GetSpellCastTime(uint32 spellId) const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the cast time in milliseconds for a specified spell ID.
  description: The GetSpellCastTime method retrieves the base cast time of a spell
    from the game's spell database. This value represents how long a player or creature
    must channel or prepare before a spell is executed. The returned value is typically
    used by the core to enforce proper spell casting delays and synchronization with
    animations. It does not account for modifiers such as haste, buffs, or debuffs
    that may alter actual cast times during gameplay. This method serves as a lookup
    utility for spell timing mechanics within the combat system.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the base cast time of the specified
    spell in milliseconds. If the spell ID is invalid or not found in the database,
    it returns 0, indicating no cast time or an error condition.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Retrieve Spell Cast Time
    code: "uint32 castTime = combatSpec->GetSpellCastTime(12345);\nif (castTime >\
      \ 0)\n{\n    // Use the cast time for spell delay logic\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Spell 12345 has a cast time of %u ms\", castTime);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a database lookup based on spell ID. While efficient,
    repeated calls for many spells in tight loops could impact performance. The returned
    value is static and does not include dynamic modifiers like haste or spell modifications
    applied during combat.
  warnings: Ensure that the spell ID passed to this method exists in the game's spell
    database; otherwise, it will return 0, which may lead to incorrect behavior if
    not handled properly. This function should not be used directly for calculating
    real-time cast times in combat as it does not consider modifiers.
