documentation:
  brief: Creates and spawns a new bot character with the specified attributes for
    the given master account.
  description: The CreateAndSpawnBot method is responsible for generating a new bot
    character within the TrinityCore framework. It takes in parameters such as the
    master account ID, class, race, gender, and name to define the bot's characteristics.
    The method attempts to create the character in the database and then spawns it
    into the game world. This functionality is typically used by bot management systems
    or automated player assistance tools within World of Warcraft servers. The method
    ensures that all necessary validations are performed before creating and spawning
    the bot, including checking for valid class/race/gender combinations and ensuring
    the character name is unique.
  parameters:
  - name: masterAccountId
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the master account that will own
      this bot character. Must be a valid existing account ID in the database.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier for the bot character (e.g., 1 for Warrior,
      2 for Paladin, etc.). Must correspond to a valid class in the game's class system.
  - name: race
    description: The race identifier for the bot character (e.g., 1 for Human, 2 for
      Orc, etc.). Must correspond to a valid race in the game's race system.
  - name: gender
    description: The gender of the bot character (0 for Male, 1 for Female). Must
      be either 0 or 1.
  - name: name
    description: The name to assign to the new bot character. Must be unique across
      all characters in the database and follow naming conventions.
  - name: outCharacterGuid
    description: Reference to an integer that will receive the GUID of the newly created
      character upon successful completion. This value can be used for further operations
      on the bot.
  returns: Returns true if the bot was successfully created and spawned, false otherwise.
    A return value of false typically indicates a failure during creation or spawning
    process, such as invalid parameters, database errors, or name conflicts.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot Creation
    code: "int characterGuid;\nif (botSpawner->CreateAndSpawnBot(12345, 1, 1, 0, \"\
      MyBotCharacter\", characterGuid)) {\n    // Bot created successfully\n    printf(\"\
      Bot created with GUID: %d\\n\", characterGuid);\n} else {\n    // Failed to\
      \ create bot\n    printf(\"Failed to create bot\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Multiple Bots
    code: "for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n    int guid;\n    std::string name = \"\
      AutoBot\" + std::to_string(i);\n    if (!botSpawner->CreateAndSpawnBot(12345,\
      \ 3, 2, 1, name, guid)) {\n        printf(\"Failed to create bot %d\\n\", i);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs database operations and may have performance implications
    when called frequently. It is recommended to batch bot creation requests or implement
    rate limiting in high-traffic scenarios. The method assumes that the provided
    account ID exists and has sufficient permissions to create characters.
  warnings: Ensure that all input parameters are validated before calling this method,
    especially the masterAccountId, classId, race, and gender values. Using invalid
    values may result in undefined behavior or database corruption. Also note that
    creating too many bots simultaneously might overwhelm the server's resources.
