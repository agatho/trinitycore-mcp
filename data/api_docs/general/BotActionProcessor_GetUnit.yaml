  method: GetUnit
  signature: Unit * BotActionProcessor::GetUnit(Player * bot, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves a Unit object from a bot player using its GUID.
  description: The GetUnit method is used to retrieve a Unit pointer associated with
    a specific bot player and GUID. This method serves as a lookup mechanism within
    the TrinityCore bot system, allowing access to various game entities such as creatures,
    players, or game objects that are linked to a particular bot. The method likely
    performs internal caching or registry lookups to efficiently return the requested
    Unit object. It is commonly used in bot AI logic where the bot needs to interact
    with or reference specific units in the game world.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that owns or is
      associated with the unit being retrieved.
  - name: guid
    description: Integer value representing the unique identifier (GUID) of the target
      Unit to retrieve. This GUID should correspond to a valid game object in the
      world.
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit object if found, or nullptr if no unit with
    the specified GUID exists for the given bot. The returned pointer is valid only
    as long as the unit remains in the game world and has not been destroyed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to get a unit by GUID
    code: "Player* myBot = ...; // Bot player instance\nUnit* targetUnit = botActionProcessor->GetUnit(myBot,\
      \ 12345);\nif (targetUnit != nullptr) {\n    // Use the target unit\n    //\
      \ For example: bot->Attack(targetUnit);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Safe usage with null check
    code: "Player* bot = ...;\nint targetGuid = 98765;\nUnit* unit = botActionProcessor->GetUnit(bot,\
      \ targetGuid);\nif (unit && unit->IsAlive()) {\n    // Perform actions on alive\
      \ unit\n    bot->CastSpell(unit, 12345, true); // Cast spell on unit\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Handle case where unit is not found or dead\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal caching to improve performance when retrieving
    units multiple times. The GUID parameter should be validated before calling this
    method, as invalid GUIDs may result in null returns. This method is typically
    used within bot AI decision-making loops and should be called carefully to avoid
    performance degradation.
  warnings: Calling GetUnit with an invalid or non-existent GUID will return nullptr,
    which can lead to null pointer dereferences if not properly checked. Ensure that
    the bot player object is valid and active before calling this method. Avoid frequent
    calls in tight loops without caching results.
