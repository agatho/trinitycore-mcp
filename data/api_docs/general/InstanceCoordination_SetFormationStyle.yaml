api:
  class: InstanceCoordination
  method: SetFormationStyle
  signature: void InstanceCoordination::SetFormationStyle(uint32 groupId, const std::string
    & formationStyle)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the formation style for a specified group within an instance.
  description: The SetFormationStyle method configures the tactical formation behavior
    for a given group ID within a World of Warcraft instance. This method allows dungeon
    masters or game systems to define how players in a specific group should position
    themselves during encounters, such as in a line, circle, or other predefined formations.
    The formation style is typically used by AI systems or scripted events to control
    group positioning and behavior during instance content. This method does not validate
    the formationStyle parameter against known values, so invalid styles may result
    in undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: groupId
    description: Unique identifier for the group within the instance. This ID corresponds
      to a specific group of players that will be affected by the formation style
      setting.
  - name: formationStyle
    description: String identifier representing the desired formation style. Valid
      values are typically predefined constants or strings like 'line', 'circle',
      'box', or custom formations defined by the game logic.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: instanceCoordination->SetFormationStyle(12345, "line");
    language: cpp
  - title: Setting Circle Formation
    code: instanceCoordination->SetFormationStyle(67890, "circle");
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other instance coordination
    features such as group movement, AI behavior, or scripted events. The formation
    style string should match expected values defined elsewhere in the TrinityCore
    codebase for consistent behavior.
  warnings: Improper usage of this method with invalid groupId or formationStyle parameters
    may lead to unexpected positioning behavior or errors during instance encounters.
    Ensure that the group ID corresponds to an active group before calling this method.
