  signature: uint32 BotAccountMgr::AcquireAccount()
documentation:
  brief: Acquires and returns the next available bot account identifier from the manager.
  description: The AcquireAccount method is responsible for retrieving the next unused
    bot account identifier from the BotAccountMgr. This method ensures that each bot
    account receives a unique numeric identifier, which is essential for tracking
    and managing bot accounts within the TrinityCore framework. The method typically
    operates by maintaining an internal counter or pool of available identifiers and
    returns the next one in sequence. It's commonly used during the creation or initialization
    phase of bot accounts to assign them their unique GUIDs. The operation is generally
    thread-safe, but depends on the underlying implementation details of the manager's
    internal state management.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the acquired bot account identifier
    (GUID). This identifier is guaranteed to be unique within the context of the current
    session or database. If no more accounts are available, it may return 0 or throw
    an exception depending on implementation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 accountId = botAccountMgr.AcquireAccount();\nif (accountId != 0)\n\
      {\n    // Successfully acquired a new bot account ID\n    std::cout << \"Acquired\
      \ bot account ID: \" << accountId << std::endl;\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Failed to\
      \ acquire an account ID\n    std::cerr << \"Failed to acquire bot account ID\"\
      \ << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during the initialization of bot characters
    or when creating new bot accounts. The returned identifier should be stored and
    used for subsequent operations related to that specific bot account. Implementation
    may involve atomic operations or locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety in
    multi-threaded environments.
  warnings: If this method is called excessively without proper cleanup or reuse of
    identifiers, it may lead to exhaustion of available account IDs. Ensure proper
    error handling as the method might return zero if no more IDs are available.
