documentation:
  brief: Removes the oldest entry from the hostile cache.
  description: The EvictOldestEntry method removes the entry that has been stored
    in the BotLocalHostileCache for the longest duration. This method is typically
    called when the cache reaches its maximum capacity to make room for new entries.
    It ensures that the cache maintains a reasonable size and prevents memory bloat
    by discarding stale data. The eviction policy is based on insertion time, not
    usage frequency or priority.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotLocalHostileCache cache;

      // Add some entries to the cache

      // ...

      cache.EvictOldestEntry(); // Remove the oldest entry'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the cache management system
    when new entries are added and the maximum capacity is reached. It's important
    to note that this method does not return any information about the evicted entry,
    so if tracking is needed, it should be handled separately.
