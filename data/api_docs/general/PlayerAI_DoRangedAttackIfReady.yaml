  method: DoRangedAttackIfReady
  signature: void PlayerAI::DoRangedAttackIfReady()
documentation:
  brief: Performs a ranged attack if the player is ready to attack and has a valid
    ranged weapon equipped.
  description: The DoRangedAttackIfReady method checks whether the player character
    is capable of performing a ranged attack at the current moment. It verifies that
    the player has a ranged weapon equipped, that the weapon is ready (not on cooldown),
    and that the player's current state allows for attacking. If all conditions are
    met, it initiates a ranged attack using the player's current target. This method
    is typically invoked by the AI system during combat to automate ranged attacks
    for player characters controlled by the server. The method does not directly handle
    damage calculation or target selection; those are managed by underlying systems.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Loop
    code: "void PlayerAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (!UpdateVictim())\n   \
      \     return;\n\n    DoRangedAttackIfReady();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player's target and combat state are already
    properly initialized. It is intended to be used within an AI update loop where
    combat readiness is regularly evaluated. The actual attack execution may involve
    additional checks such as line of sight, range, and targeting validity.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring a valid target or proper combat context
    can result in undefined behavior or silent failures. Developers should ensure
    that UpdateVictim() or similar logic is executed before invoking DoRangedAttackIfReady().
