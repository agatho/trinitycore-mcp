documentation:
  brief: Returns the Player object associated with this bot session
  description: The GetPlayer method retrieves the Player instance that represents
    the character controlled by this bot session. This method provides access to all
    player-related data and functionality within the TrinityCore framework. The returned
    Player pointer is valid for the duration of the bot session and can be used to
    interact with the player's inventory, stats, quest progress, and other game state
    information. This method is typically used in bot AI logic to perform actions
    on behalf of the player character.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the Player object associated with this bot session, or nullptr
    if no player is currently associated with the session
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to access player data
    code: "IBotSession* session = GetBotSession();\nPlayer* player = session->GetPlayer();\n\
      if (player)\n{\n    uint32 level = player->getLevel();\n    ObjectGuid guid\
      \ = player->GetGUID();\n    // Use player data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using player object for bot AI decisions
    code: "IBotSession* session = GetBotSession();\nPlayer* player = session->GetPlayer();\n\
      if (player && player->IsAlive())\n{\n    uint32 health = player->GetHealth();\n\
      \    uint32 mana = player->GetPower(POWER_MANA);\n    // Make AI decisions based\
      \ on player's current state\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Player pointer should be checked for null before use, as the
    session may not always have an associated player. This method does not perform
    any validation or initialization of the player object - it simply returns a reference
    to the existing instance. The player object returned is managed by the core system
    and should not be deleted by the caller.
  warnings: Never assume the returned Player pointer is valid without checking for
    null. Accessing methods on a null player pointer will cause a crash. Be aware
    that the player object may become invalid if the session is terminated or the
    player logs out during bot operation.
