  class: LootDistribution
  method: NotifyRollResult
  signature: void LootDistribution::NotifyRollResult(const LootRoll & roll)
documentation:
  brief: Notifies all players in the loot distribution of the roll result for a specific
    item.
  description: The NotifyRollResult method broadcasts the outcome of a loot roll to
    all players involved in the distribution. This method is typically called after
    a player has rolled on an item, and it ensures that all participants in the loot
    group are informed of the result. It handles the communication aspect of the loot
    system, updating client interfaces and maintaining synchronization between server
    state and player views. The method operates within the context of a loot distribution,
    where multiple players may be rolling for the same item, and it ensures proper
    notification regardless of whether the roll was successful or not.
  parameters:
  - name: roll
    description: A reference to the LootRoll object containing information about the
      specific roll that occurred. This includes details such as the player who rolled,
      the item rolled on, and the result of the roll (e.g., need, greed, pass).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot processing
    code: 'LootRoll roll;

      // ... populate roll with data ...

      lootDistribution.NotifyRollResult(roll);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with loot roll completion logic
    code: "void HandleLootRollComplete(LootDistribution& distribution, LootRoll& currentRoll)\n\
      {\n    // Process the roll result\n    if (currentRoll.GetResult() == LOOT_ROLL_NEED)\n\
      \    {\n        // Award item to player\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    //\
      \ Notify all players of the outcome\n    distribution.NotifyRollResult(currentRoll);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core loot distribution system and should only
    be called when a roll has been finalized. It assumes that the roll object contains
    valid data and that the distribution context is properly initialized. The notification
    mechanism may involve sending packets to multiple clients, so performance considerations
    should be taken into account for high-frequency loot events.
  warnings: Calling this method without proper initialization of the LootRoll object
    or with invalid data can lead to client-side errors or inconsistent state. Ensure
    that all players in the distribution have been properly added before calling this
    method, and that the roll result is finalized before notification occurs.
