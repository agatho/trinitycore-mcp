  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: GetGroupSpread
  signature: float FollowBehaviorUtils::GetGroupSpread(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the average distance between group members in a player
    group.
  description: The GetGroupSpread method computes the average Euclidean distance between
    all pairs of players within a given group. This metric is commonly used in AI
    behavior systems to determine how spread out or clustered a group of players is
    in world space. The calculation considers every unique pair of players in the
    group and averages their pairwise distances. This value can be used for various
    game mechanics such as determining optimal formation spacing, AI movement decisions,
    or group coordination behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the average distance between all pairs
    of players in the group. A value of 0.0 indicates that all players are at the
    same location, while larger values indicate greater spread. Returns 0.0 if the
    group is null or contains fewer than two members.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Group* myGroup = player->GetGroup();\nif (myGroup)\n{\n    float spread\
      \ = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetGroupSpread(myGroup);\n    // Use the spread value\
      \ for AI decisions\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Spread for Formation Control
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    float spread = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetGroupSpread(group);\n\
      \    if (spread < 5.0f)\n    {\n        // Group is too close, move them apart\n\
      \        // Implementation for spreading out\n    }\n    else if (spread > 20.0f)\n\
      \    {\n        // Group is too spread out, bring them together\n        //\
      \ Implementation for grouping\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: "This method performs O(n\xB2) calculations where n is the number of group\
    \ members, making it computationally expensive for large groups. The calculation\
    \ includes all unique pairs of players and computes Euclidean distance in 3D space.\
    \ For performance-critical applications, consider caching this value or using\
    \ approximate methods."
  warnings: This method will return 0.0 if passed a null group pointer or a group
    with less than two members. Ensure the group is valid and contains multiple players
    before calling to avoid unexpected behavior. The returned value may vary significantly
    based on player positioning and should be used appropriately in AI decision-making
    systems.
