  class: LootCoordination
  method: ResolveConflictByRotation
  signature: void LootCoordination::ResolveConflictByRotation(Group * group, const
    LootItem & item, const int & conflictingPlayers)
documentation:
  brief: Resolves loot conflict within a group by rotating through eligible players
    to determine the final looter.
  description: The ResolveConflictByRotation method is used in TrinityCore's loot
    coordination system to handle situations where multiple players have expressed
    interest in the same item, typically during group loot scenarios. It implements
    a rotation-based algorithm that selects the next eligible player from the group
    based on predefined rules, ensuring fair distribution of loot among group members.
    This method is part of the LootCoordination class and operates within the context
    of group-based loot systems such as round-robin or master loot. The method takes
    into account the group structure, item properties, and conflicting players to
    determine a resolution without requiring manual intervention. It modifies internal
    state variables related to loot assignment and may trigger notifications or updates
    to client interfaces.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object representing the group of players involved
      in the loot conflict. Must be a valid group with at least one member.
  - name: item
    description: Reference to the LootItem structure containing details about the
      item causing the conflict, including its ID, stack size, and other relevant
      properties.
  - name: conflictingPlayers
    description: Integer value indicating the number of players who have expressed
      interest in the conflicting item. Used to determine rotation logic and eligibility.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in loot resolution
    code: "void ExampleUsage() {\n    Group* group = player->GetGroup();\n    LootItem\
      \ item;\n    int conflictingPlayers = 3;\n    lootCoordination.ResolveConflictByRotation(group,\
      \ item, conflictingPlayers);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group is properly initialized and contains valid
    members. The rotation logic may depend on internal state variables like last looter
    index or group loot rules. It's typically called internally by the loot system
    when a conflict arises, not directly by external code.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid group pointer or zero conflicting
    players may lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that the group is in a valid state
    before invoking this method.
