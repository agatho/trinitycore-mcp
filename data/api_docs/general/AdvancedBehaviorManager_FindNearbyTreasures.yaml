documentation:
  brief: Scans the surrounding area for nearby treasure objects and processes them
    for loot collection.
  description: The FindNearbyTreasures method performs a spatial search within the
    AI's defined detection range to locate nearby treasure objects such as chests,
    lootable items, or hidden caches. It iterates through nearby game entities and
    identifies those that match treasure criteria based on their type, state, and
    accessibility. This method is typically invoked during behavior execution to dynamically
    discover and prioritize treasure-related objectives for the AI character. The
    method does not return any value but updates internal state variables related
    to discovered treasures and their potential loot distribution.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other logic ...\n    m_behaviorManager->FindNearbyTreasures();\n\
      \    // ... continue with loot processing ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the AI's current position and detection range to identify
    treasures. It may perform multiple database queries or spatial checks depending
    on the number of nearby objects. The method is designed to be called periodically
    during AI update cycles rather than continuously.
  warnings: Ensure that the AI has proper access permissions and that treasure objects
    are not in an invalid state (e.g., already looted or locked) before attempting
    to process them. Calling this method without proper initialization may lead to
    undefined behavior.
