  class: LearningAnalytics
  method: Instance
  signature: LearningAnalytics & LearningAnalytics::Instance()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the LearningAnalytics class for accessing
    player learning and progression data.
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern to provide global
    access to a single, shared instance of the LearningAnalytics class. This class
    is responsible for tracking and managing player learning analytics within the
    TrinityCore framework, including skill acquisition, quest completion rates, and
    progression metrics. The method ensures that only one instance of LearningAnalytics
    exists throughout the application lifecycle, providing consistent access to learning-related
    data across different subsystems. The singleton instance is typically initialized
    during server startup and remains available for the duration of the server's operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: A reference to the singleton instance of the LearningAnalytics class. This
    reference provides access to all methods and data members of the LearningAnalytics
    class for retrieving and manipulating player learning analytics information.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Learning Analytics Instance
    code: 'LearningAnalytics& analytics = LearningAnalytics::Instance();

      // Use the analytics instance to retrieve player learning data

      uint32 completedQuests = analytics.GetCompletedQuestCount(playerGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Instance for Data Collection
    code: "void OnPlayerLearnSpell(Player* player, uint32 spellId) {\n    LearningAnalytics&\
      \ analytics = LearningAnalytics::Instance();\n    analytics.RecordSpellLearning(player->GetGUID(),\
      \ spellId);\n    // Additional logic for handling spell learning\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe as the singleton instance is typically initialized
    during server startup and accessed read-only after initialization. The singleton
    pattern ensures that all parts of the codebase access the same analytics data,
    maintaining consistency in player progression tracking.
