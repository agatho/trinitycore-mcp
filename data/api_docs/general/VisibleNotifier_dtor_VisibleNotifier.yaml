  class: VisibleNotifier
  method: ~VisibleNotifier
  signature: void VisibleNotifier::~VisibleNotifier()
documentation:
  brief: Destroys a VisibleNotifier object and cleans up its associated resources.
  description: The ~VisibleNotifier destructor is responsible for properly cleaning
    up all resources allocated by the VisibleNotifier class. This includes releasing
    any memory held by internal data structures, notifying relevant systems about
    the destruction, and ensuring that no dangling references remain. In the context
    of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft emulation, this destructor plays a critical
    role in managing visibility updates for players and creatures within the game
    world, particularly when objects are removed from a player's visible set or when
    a player logs out. The destructor ensures that all pending visibility notifications
    are properly handled before the object is destroyed.

  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of VisibleNotifier
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    VisibleNotifier notifier;\n    // ... use notifier\
      \ ...\n    // Destructor called automatically when notifier goes out of scope\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Destruction in a container context
    code: "std::vector<VisibleNotifier> notifiers;\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n\
      {\n    notifiers.emplace_back();\n}\n// All destructors called automatically\
      \ when vector is destroyed\nnotifiers.clear(); // Explicitly clear to trigger\
      \ destruction"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a VisibleNotifier object goes
    out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It's important to note that this destructor
    should not be called manually unless the object was allocated on the heap using
    new. The implementation likely handles cleanup of visibility-related data structures
    and ensures proper synchronization with the game world's update systems.
