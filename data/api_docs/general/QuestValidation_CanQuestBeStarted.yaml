  class: QuestValidation
  method: CanQuestBeStarted
  signature: bool QuestValidation::CanQuestBeStarted(uint32 questId, Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player can start a specific quest based on quest requirements
    and player state.
  description: The CanQuestBeStarted method evaluates if a given quest can be initiated
    by a specified player. It checks various conditions such as quest prerequisites,
    player level, completed quests, required items, and other game-specific restrictions.
    This method is typically used in quest validation logic to ensure players meet
    all necessary criteria before they can begin a quest. The method returns true
    if the quest can be started, false otherwise. It does not modify any game state
    but rather performs read-only checks on player and quest data.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest to check. Must be a valid quest
      ID present in the game database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the player who is attempting
      to start the quest. Cannot be null.
  returns: Returns true if the player can start the specified quest, false if they
    cannot. This includes cases where the player has already completed the quest,
    does not meet level requirements, lacks required items, or fails other prerequisite
    checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation Check
    code: "if (QuestValidation::CanQuestBeStarted(12345, player)) {\n    // Player\
      \ can start quest 12345\n    player->AddQuest(12345);\n} else {\n    // Player\
      \ cannot start quest 12345\n    player->SendNotification(\"You cannot start\
      \ this quest.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI Quest Logic
    code: "class QuestBot {\npublic:\n    bool TryStartQuest(uint32 questId, Player*\
      \ bot) {\n        if (QuestValidation::CanQuestBeStarted(questId, bot)) {\n\
      \            // Proceed with quest initiation logic\n            return bot->AddQuest(questId);\n\
      \        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs multiple database lookups and checks against player
    data, so it should not be called excessively in performance-critical code paths.
    The implementation likely caches certain values to improve performance for repeated
    checks. It is part of the core quest validation system used by both player interactions
    and AI quest bots.
  warnings: Ensure that the Player pointer passed is valid and not null before calling
    this method, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. Also,
    note that this method only validates if the quest can be started; it does not
    actually start the quest or modify the player's quest log.
