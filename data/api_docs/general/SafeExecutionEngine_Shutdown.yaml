  class: SafeExecutionEngine
  method: Shutdown
  signature: void SafeExecutionEngine::Shutdown()
documentation:
  brief: Initiates the shutdown sequence for the safe execution engine, gracefully
    terminating all active operations and releasing resources.
  description: The Shutdown method is responsible for safely terminating the SafeExecutionEngine's
    operations. It ensures that all pending tasks are completed or properly cancelled,
    resources are released, and any cleanup routines are executed before the engine
    transitions into a shutdown state. This method is typically invoked during server
    shutdown or when the engine needs to be reset for maintenance purposes. The method
    does not return control until the shutdown process is fully complete, making it
    a blocking operation. It is designed to handle concurrent access safely and should
    only be called when no other threads are actively using the engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Usage
    code: 'SafeExecutionEngine* engine = SafeExecutionEngine::GetInstance();

      engine->Shutdown();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It internally
    manages synchronization primitives to ensure that no active tasks are running
    when shutdown completes. The implementation assumes that no new tasks will be
    submitted after this call, as it transitions the engine into a closed state.
  warnings: Calling Shutdown while tasks are actively executing may result in those
    tasks being forcefully terminated or left in an inconsistent state if they do
    not properly handle interruption. Ensure all external references to the engine
    are cleared before invoking this method.
