documentation:
  brief: Updates the Shaman AI's buff management state based on current combat conditions
    and spell availability.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method in the ShamanAI class is responsible for managing
    and applying appropriate buffs to the shaman character during gameplay. This method
    evaluates the current state of the shaman, including available spells, mana levels,
    and combat situation, to determine which buffs should be active or applied. It
    typically handles self-buffs such as Water Walking, Ghost Wolf, or other utility
    auras that enhance the shaman's capabilities in various situations. The method
    is called regularly by the AI system to ensure optimal buff usage based on evolving
    game conditions.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ShamanAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked as part of the regular AI update cycle and
    should not be called manually unless implementing custom behavior. The implementation
    likely checks for spell cooldowns, mana availability, and target status before
    applying buffs. Performance-wise, this method should execute quickly as it's called
    frequently during combat.
  warnings: Avoid calling UpdateBuffs directly from outside the AI system as it may
    interfere with normal AI state management. Ensure that any custom modifications
    to buff logic do not conflict with existing spell cooldown or mana management
    systems.
