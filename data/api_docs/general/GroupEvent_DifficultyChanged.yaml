documentation:
  brief: Creates a GroupEvent object indicating that the difficulty of a group has
    changed
  description: The DifficultyChanged method is a static factory function that constructs
    and returns a GroupEvent object to signal when a group's difficulty level has
    been modified. This event is typically used within the TrinityCore framework to
    notify subsystems about changes in group difficulty, such as when players adjust
    the difficulty of a dungeon or raid instance. The method takes the group's unique
    identifier and the new difficulty level as parameters to properly initialize the
    event object.
  parameters:
  - name: groupGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the group whose difficulty has changed.
      This is typically a 32-bit integer representing the group's database ID or internal
      identifier.
  - name: difficulty
    description: The new difficulty level for the group. This is a uint8 value that
      corresponds to standard World of Warcraft difficulty constants (e.g., 1 = Normal,
      2 = Heroic, 3 = Mythic).
  returns: A GroupEvent object representing the difficulty change event, initialized
    with the provided group GUID and difficulty level.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of DifficultyChanged
    code: 'GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::DifficultyChanged(12345, 2);

      // Creates a GroupEvent for group with GUID 12345 changing to Heroic difficulty'
    language: cpp
  - title: Using DifficultyChanged in event handling context
    code: "void HandleDifficultyChange(uint32 groupId, uint8 newDifficulty) {\n  \
      \  GroupEvent event = GroupEvent::DifficultyChanged(groupId, newDifficulty);\n\
      \    // Process the event or dispatch it to relevant subsystems\n    event.Dispatch();\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed as a static factory function and does not modify
    any global state directly. It simply creates an event object for further processing
    by the event system. The returned GroupEvent should be properly dispatched or
    handled according to the TrinityCore event handling architecture.
  warnings: Ensure that the groupGuid parameter corresponds to an actual existing
    group in the database, otherwise the event may not be processed correctly. Also,
    verify that the difficulty value is within valid range for your game version's
    supported difficulties.
