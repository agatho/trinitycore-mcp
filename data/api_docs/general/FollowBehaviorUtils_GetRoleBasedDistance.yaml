  class: FollowBehaviorUtils
  method: GetRoleBasedDistance
  signature: float FollowBehaviorUtils::GetRoleBasedDistance(int role)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the appropriate follow distance based on the unit's
    role within a group or formation.
  description: The GetRoleBasedDistance method determines the optimal distance a unit
    should maintain while following another unit, depending on its assigned role.
    This is commonly used in group-based AI behaviors where different roles (such
    as tank, healer, damage dealer) require varying distances to ensure effective
    gameplay mechanics and positioning. The method internally maps role identifiers
    to predefined distance values, which may be configurable based on game settings
    or unit type. It assumes that the calling unit has a valid role assigned and returns
    a float representing the distance in yards.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value indicating the recommended follow distance for the unit's
    current role, measured in yards. Returns 0.0 if the role is invalid or not recognized.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Behavior
    code: "float distance = FollowBehaviorUtils::GetRoleBasedDistance(ROLE_TANK);\n\
      // distance will be set to the predefined tank follow distance\nif (distance\
      \ > 0.0f)\n{\n    // Proceed with movement logic using calculated distance\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on internal role-to-distance mappings that are typically
    defined in configuration files or hardcoded defaults. It does not perform any
    validation of the unit's actual role state, so calling code should ensure that
    the role is valid before invoking this function.
  warnings: Ensure that the role parameter passed to this method corresponds to a
    known and supported role within the game's AI system; passing an invalid role
    may result in unexpected behavior or a return value of 0.0f.
