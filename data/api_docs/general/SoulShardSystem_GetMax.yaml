documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum number of soul shards that can be stored in the SoulShardSystem
  description: The GetMax method retrieves the upper limit of soul shards that a player's
    SoulShardSystem can hold. This value typically represents the maximum capacity
    of the system and is used to determine how many soul shards can be accumulated
    before the system becomes full. The returned value may vary based on the player's
    class, talents, or other game mechanics that affect soul shard storage. This method
    does not modify any internal state and is purely informational.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the maximum number of soul shards that can
    be stored in the SoulShardSystem. This value is typically constant for a given
    player class and may be influenced by enchantments, buffs, or other temporary
    modifiers.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'uint32 maxShards = player->GetSoulShardSystem()->GetMax();

      TC_LOG_INFO("server.loading", "Player can store up to %u soul shards", maxShards);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Storage Capacity
    code: "SoulShardSystem* shardSystem = player->GetSoulShardSystem();\nuint32 current\
      \ = shardSystem->GetCurrent();\nuint32 max = shardSystem->GetMax();\nif (current\
      \ >= max)\n{\n    TC_LOG_DEBUG(\"player.skills\", \"Soul shard system is full\"\
      );\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called frequently during gameplay to determine if
    the soul shard system can accept more shards. The maximum value may be affected
    by class-specific abilities, gear bonuses, or temporary effects that modify storage
    capacity.
  warnings: The returned value represents only the base maximum and does not account
    for temporary modifiers that might increase capacity during specific game events
    or encounters. Always check current capacity against maximum when implementing
    logic that depends on available space.
