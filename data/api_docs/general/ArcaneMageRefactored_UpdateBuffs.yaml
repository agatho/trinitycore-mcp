  method: UpdateBuffs
  signature: void ArcaneMageRefactored::UpdateBuffs()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the arcane mage's buffs and auras based on current game state and
    spell effects.
  description: The UpdateBuffs method is responsible for managing and refreshing all
    active buff effects on an Arcane Mage character. This includes tracking spell
    auras, applying stat modifications, and ensuring that temporary enhancements such
    as mana regeneration, damage increases, or movement speed boosts are properly
    maintained throughout the player's gameplay session. The method typically integrates
    with the core TrinityCore AI system to synchronize buff states with the game world,
    ensuring that buffs are correctly applied, refreshed, or removed based on duration
    timers, spell interactions, or external events like combat status changes or environmental
    effects.

  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void ArcaneMageAI::Update()\n{\n    // Other AI logic...\n    m_mage->UpdateBuffs();\n\
      \    // Continue with other updates...\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Manual Buff Refresh Trigger
    code: "void ArcaneMageRefactored::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spell)\n{\n   \
      \ // Handle spell-specific logic\n    if (spell->Id == 36032) // Arcane Brilliance\n\
      \    {\n        UpdateBuffs(); // Force refresh all buffs after casting\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during AI update cycles or in response to
    specific spell events. It may interact with internal buff tracking systems and
    should not be invoked excessively without consideration for performance impact.
    The method assumes that the Arcane Mage object has valid references to its current
    spell effects and aura state.
  warnings: Calling UpdateBuffs() outside of appropriate AI update contexts may lead
    to inconsistent buff states or unexpected behavior. Ensure that all relevant spell
    effects are properly registered before calling this method, as it relies on accurate
    internal state tracking.
