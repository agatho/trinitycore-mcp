  class: LootDistribution
  method: OptimizeLootDistribution
  signature: void LootDistribution::OptimizeLootDistribution(Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes loot distribution for a given group by adjusting item assignment
    logic and priority handling.
  description: The OptimizeLootDistribution method adjusts how loot is distributed
    among group members to improve fairness and efficiency. This method typically
    recalculates loot priorities, handles disenchanted items, and ensures that loot
    is assigned according to group rules such as round-robin or free-for-all distribution.
    It may also consider player roles, loot thresholds, and other game-specific mechanics
    to determine optimal item assignment. The function operates on a Group object
    which contains the list of players eligible for loot distribution.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing members who will receive loot.
      Must be a valid group with at least one member, otherwise behavior is undefined.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeLootDistribution
    code: "Group* group = player->GetGroup();\nif (group)\n{\n    LootDistribution::OptimizeLootDistribution(group);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked during loot distribution events, such as
    when a mob is killed and loot needs to be assigned. It may modify internal loot
    state within the group and should not be called concurrently with other loot-related
    operations.
  warnings: Calling this function without a valid Group pointer can lead to undefined
    behavior or crashes. Ensure that the group exists and has members before invoking
    this method.
