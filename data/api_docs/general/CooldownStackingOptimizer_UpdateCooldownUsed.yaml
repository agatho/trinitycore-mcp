  class: CooldownStackingOptimizer
  method: UpdateCooldownUsed
  signature: void CooldownStackingOptimizer::UpdateCooldownUsed(uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the cooldown tracking for a specified spell in the cooldown stacking
    optimizer.
  description: The UpdateCooldownUsed method is responsible for updating internal
    cooldown tracking data when a spell is used. This method ensures that the cooldown
    stacking optimizer maintains accurate state information about which spells are
    currently on cooldown and their remaining durations. It typically gets called
    whenever a player casts a spell that has a cooldown, allowing the system to properly
    manage overlapping or stacking cooldown effects. The method does not directly
    affect gameplay mechanics but rather serves as an internal state management function
    for the cooldown system.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell that has been used and whose cooldown
      needs to be updated. This should correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's
      spell database.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "void Player::OnSpellCast(SpellInfo const* spellInfo)\n{\n    // Update\
      \ cooldown tracking for the cast spell\n    cooldownOptimizer.UpdateCooldownUsed(spellInfo->Id);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void Player::CastSpell(uint32 spellId)\n{\n    // ... spell validation\
      \ and preparation ...\n    \n    // Cast the spell\n    DoCast(spellId);\n \
      \   \n    // Update cooldown tracking\n    if (cooldownOptimizer)\n        cooldownOptimizer->UpdateCooldownUsed(spellId);\n\
      \    \n    // ... rest of casting logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the internal cooldown management system and should
    only be called when a spell is actually cast. It does not perform any validation
    on the spellId parameter, so callers should ensure that the provided spell ID
    is valid before calling this method. The method assumes that the cooldown stacking
    optimizer has been properly initialized and configured.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid or non-existent spellId may lead to
    undefined behavior or incorrect cooldown tracking. Always validate spell IDs before
    passing them to this method. Additionally, ensure thread safety if this method
    is called from multiple threads simultaneously.
