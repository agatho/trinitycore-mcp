documentation:
  brief: Initializes all profession data and capabilities specific to priest characters
    in the game.
  description: The InitializePriestProfessions method sets up and configures all magical
    crafting professions and abilities that are exclusive or enhanced for priest class
    characters within the TrinityCore framework. This includes initializing spell
    books, skill levels, recipe availability, and any class-specific profession mechanics
    such as holy or shadow magic crafting. The method ensures that priests have access
    to their unique profession combinations and capabilities from the moment they
    are loaded into the game world. It typically runs during player initialization
    or when a priest character is first created, ensuring proper setup of all priest-related
    crafting systems.

  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core system during character
    loading and should not be invoked manually unless specifically required for custom
    implementations. It may perform database lookups or memory allocations to set
    up profession data structures.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times on the same player instance can lead
    to undefined behavior or duplicate profession entries. Ensure it's only called
    once per character during initialization.
