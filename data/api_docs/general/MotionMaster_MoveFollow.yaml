  class: MotionMaster
  method: MoveFollow
  signature: void MotionMaster::MoveFollow(Unit * target, float dist, int angle, int
    duration, bool ignoreTargetWalk, MovementSlot slot, int param6)
documentation:
  brief: Initiates a follow movement toward a target unit with specified distance
    and angle.
  description: The MoveFollow method instructs the motion master to begin following
    a target unit at a given distance and angle. This is commonly used for AI behavior,
    such as having NPCs follow players or other units. The method supports optional
    parameters for duration, walk mode, and slot assignment. It leverages the underlying
    movement system to maintain the specified relative position while the target moves.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit that this motion master will follow. Must be
      a valid unit object.
  - name: dist
    description: The distance in yards to maintain from the target unit while following.
  - name: angle
    description: The angle in degrees relative to the target's facing direction (0
      = front, 90 = right, etc.).
  - name: duration
    description: Optional duration in milliseconds for how long the follow behavior
      should last. If zero, it will continue indefinitely.
  - name: ignoreTargetWalk
    description: If true, the follower will not adjust its movement speed to match
      the target's walking state.
  - name: slot
    description: The movement slot (e.g., MOVEMENT_SLOT_DEFAULT) where this motion
      should be queued or executed.
  - name: param6
    description: Additional parameter, often used for internal flags or custom behavior
      control.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Follow Movement
    code: motionMaster->MoveFollow(player, 2.0f, 0, 0, false, MOVEMENT_SLOT_DEFAULT,
      0);
    language: cpp
  - title: Continuous Follow with Custom Angle
    code: motionMaster->MoveFollow(targetUnit, 3.0f, 180, 0, true, MOVEMENT_SLOT_DEFAULT,
      0);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method uses the MovementGenerator system internally and may queue or
    override existing movement behaviors depending on the slot provided. The motion
    will be canceled if the target unit becomes invalid or dies.
  warnings: Ensure that the target pointer is valid before calling this method, otherwise
    it can cause crashes. Also, setting duration to zero means the follow behavior
    will persist until manually stopped or interrupted by another movement command.
