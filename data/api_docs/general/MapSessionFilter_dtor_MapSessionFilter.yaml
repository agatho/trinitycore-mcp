documentation:
  brief: Destroys a MapSessionFilter instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The ~MapSessionFilter destructor is responsible for cleaning up the
    internal state of a MapSessionFilter object. This includes releasing any dynamically
    allocated memory, clearing internal data structures, and ensuring that no dangling
    references remain. In the context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation,
    MapSessionFilter is used to manage and filter sessions based on map-related criteria,
    such as which players should receive updates or messages for a specific map instance.
    The destructor ensures proper cleanup when the filter object goes out of scope
    or is explicitly deleted, preventing memory leaks and maintaining system stability.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of MapSessionFilter
    code: 'MapSessionFilter filter;

      // ... use the filter ...

      // Destructor automatically called here when filter goes out of scope'
    language: cpp
  - title: Explicit deletion of MapSessionFilter pointer
    code: 'MapSessionFilter* filter = new MapSessionFilter();

      // ... use the filter ...

      delete filter; // Calls destructor explicitly'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically invoked when a MapSessionFilter object goes
    out of scope or is deleted. It's important to note that this is a virtual destructor,
    meaning if MapSessionFilter were ever inherited from, derived destructors would
    be properly called. The implementation should ensure thread safety if the filter
    is accessed across multiple threads.
  warnings: Developers should not manually invoke the destructor unless explicitly
    deleting an object allocated with 'new'. Also, calling the destructor on a partially
    constructed object or after it has already been destroyed leads to undefined behavior.
