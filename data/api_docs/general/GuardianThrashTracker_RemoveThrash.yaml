  class: GuardianThrashTracker
  method: RemoveThrash
  signature: void GuardianThrashTracker::RemoveThrash(int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a thrash entry from the guardian's thrash tracking system by its
    unique identifier.
  description: The RemoveThrash method is responsible for removing a specific thrash
    entry from the GuardianThrashTracker's internal data structure using the provided
    GUID. This method is typically invoked when a guardian's thrash effect expires
    or is otherwise removed from the game world. The method ensures that the specified
    thrash entry is no longer tracked, preventing potential memory leaks or incorrect
    behavior in AI decision-making processes related to thrash mechanics. It assumes
    that the GUID corresponds to an existing thrash entry within the tracker.
  parameters:
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the thrash entry to be removed from
      tracking. This value should correspond to a valid thrash effect currently being
      tracked by the GuardianThrashTracker instance.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'GuardianThrashTracker tracker;

      // Assume we have a valid GUID for a thrash effect

      uint32 thrashGuid = 12345;

      tracker.RemoveThrash(thrashGuid);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in AI Context
    code: "void GuardianAI::OnThrashExpired(uint32 thrashGuid)\n{\n    m_thrashTracker.RemoveThrash(thrashGuid);\n\
      \    // Additional cleanup logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely operates on an internal container (such as a map or list)
    that stores tracked thrash entries. It's important to ensure that the GUID passed
    to this method is valid and corresponds to an actual thrash entry, otherwise the
    operation may have no effect or could potentially cause undefined behavior if
    the underlying data structure is not properly handled.
  warnings: Passing an invalid or non-existent GUID to this method may result in no-op
    behavior. Ensure that all GUIDs passed are verified before calling RemoveThrash
    to avoid potential issues with tracking consistency.
