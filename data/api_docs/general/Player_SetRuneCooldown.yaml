  class: Player
  method: SetRuneCooldown
  signature: void Player::SetRuneCooldown(uint8 index, uint32 cooldown)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the cooldown time for a specific rune of the player.
  description: This method allows setting the cooldown duration for a particular rune
    in the player's rune bar. It is used primarily to manage cooldowns for abilities
    that consume runes, such as Death Strike or Unholy Death Strike. The method modifies
    the internal cooldown state of the specified rune, which affects when the rune
    can be used again. This functionality is essential for maintaining proper game
    balance and ensuring correct behavior of class abilities.
  parameters:
  - name: index
    description: The index of the rune to set cooldown for, ranging from 0-5. Each
      rune corresponds to a specific type (Blood, Unholy, Frost, or Death).
  - name: cooldown
    description: The cooldown time in milliseconds to set for the specified rune.
      A value of 0 means no cooldown, allowing the rune to be used immediately.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting a rune cooldown
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRuneCooldown(0, 10000); // Set first rune to 10 seconds cooldown'
    language: cpp
  - title: Resetting rune cooldown
    code: 'Player* player = GetPlayer();

      player->SetRuneCooldown(2, 0); // Reset third rune''s cooldown to zero'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the internal cooldown state of the rune. It
    should be used carefully as it affects game mechanics related to rune usage and
    ability cooldowns. This method is typically called during gameplay when abilities
    that consume runes are used or when cooldowns need to be adjusted.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect rune cooldown behavior,
    potentially causing players to use abilities before they should be available.
    It's important to ensure the cooldown value matches the intended game mechanics
    for proper balance.
