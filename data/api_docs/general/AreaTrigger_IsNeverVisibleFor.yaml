  signature: bool AreaTrigger::IsNeverVisibleFor(const int * seer, bool allowServersideObjects)
    const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether an area trigger is never visible for a specific player
    or object.
  description: The IsNeverVisibleFor method checks if an area trigger should never
    be displayed to a particular observer, such as a player or game object. This determination
    is based on various conditions including the observer's type, visibility settings,
    and potentially server-side configurations. The method considers whether the observer
    is a player (or a server-side object) and evaluates if the area trigger's visibility
    rules prevent it from being shown. This functionality is crucial for managing
    visual effects, quest triggers, and other gameplay elements that should only appear
    under specific conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: seer
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the observer (typically a player
      GUID or object ID) for whom visibility is being checked. This parameter may
      be null if checking general visibility rules.
  - name: allowServersideObjects
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether server-side objects should be considered
      when evaluating visibility. If true, server-side objects are allowed to see
      the area trigger; if false, they are not.
  returns: Returns true if the area trigger is never visible for the specified observer
    according to the defined rules, otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check visibility for a player
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nuint64 playerId = 12345;\nbool isVisible =\
      \ trigger->IsNeverVisibleFor(&playerId, true);\nif (!isVisible)\n{\n    // Area\
      \ trigger should be visible to this player\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Check visibility for a server-side object
    code: "AreaTrigger* trigger = ...;\nint serverObjectId = -1000;\nbool isVisible\
      \ = trigger->IsNeverVisibleFor(&serverObjectId, false);\nif (isVisible)\n{\n\
      \    // Area trigger is never visible to server-side objects\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal visibility flags and may be used
    in conjunction with other area trigger systems like quest triggers or combat events.
    The implementation might cache results for performance reasons.
  warnings: Ensure that the seer parameter points to a valid object ID; passing an
    invalid pointer could lead to undefined behavior. Be cautious when using allowServersideObjects
    as it affects visibility logic for different types of observers.
