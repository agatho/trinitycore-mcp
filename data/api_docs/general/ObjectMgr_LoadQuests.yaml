  class: ObjectMgr
  method: LoadQuests
  signature: void ObjectMgr::LoadQuests()
documentation:
  brief: Loads all available quests from the database into memory for use in the game
    world.
  description: The LoadQuests method initializes and populates the internal quest
    database within the ObjectMgr class by retrieving quest definitions, objectives,
    rewards, and related data from the game's SQL database. This method is typically
    invoked during server startup or world initialization to ensure all quest information
    is available for player interaction. It processes quest templates, quest relations,
    quest objectives, and reward structures, making them accessible to players through
    quest givers and quest log systems. The method ensures that all quest data is
    properly validated and cached in memory for efficient lookup during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage during server initialization
    code: "void World::LoadQuests()\n{\n    sObjectMgr->LoadQuests();\n}\n\n// Called\
      \ from main server initialization logic"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called once during server startup and should not
    be invoked repeatedly. It performs database queries that may impact performance
    if called frequently. The loaded quests are cached in memory and remain available
    for the entire server runtime.
  warnings: Do not call this method from within gameplay loops or high-frequency update
    functions as it may cause performance degradation. This method assumes the database
    connection is already established and functional.
