documentation:
  brief: Destroys the BehaviorPriorityManager instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the BehaviorPriorityManager class is responsible
    for releasing all dynamically allocated memory and cleaning up internal data structures.
    This method ensures that no memory leaks occur when a BehaviorPriorityManager
    object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. The destructor typically handles
    cleanup of priority lists, behavior references, and any other resources managed
    by this class. In the context of TrinityCore's AI system, this destructor plays
    a crucial role in maintaining clean state management for NPC behavior trees and
    priority-based decision making systems.

  examples:
  - title: Basic destruction of BehaviorPriorityManager
    code: 'BehaviorPriorityManager* manager = new BehaviorPriorityManager();

      // ... use the manager ...

      delete manager; // Triggers ~BehaviorPriorityManager()'
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or
    is deleted. It's important to ensure that no other objects hold references to
    this manager after deletion, as accessing freed memory can cause undefined behavior.
    The destructor should be fast and not perform heavy operations since it's called
    during object cleanup.
  warnings: Never call the destructor directly on stack-allocated objects; let the
    compiler handle destruction automatically. Avoid using the object after calling
    delete on its pointer, as this leads to use-after-free errors.
