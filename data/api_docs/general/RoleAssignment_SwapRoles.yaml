  class: RoleAssignment
  method: SwapRoles
  signature: bool RoleAssignment::SwapRoles(uint32 player1Guid, uint32 player2Guid,
    Group * group)
documentation:
  brief: Swaps the roles of two players within a group.
  description: The SwapRoles method facilitates the exchange of roles between two
    specified players in a World of Warcraft group. This functionality is typically
    used during group management operations, such as reassigning leadership or changing
    player responsibilities within a raid or dungeon instance. The method ensures
    that both players' role assignments are properly updated and synchronized within
    the group structure. It validates that both players exist within the provided
    group before attempting the swap operation.
  parameters:
  - name: player1Guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the first player whose role will
      be swapped.
  - name: player2Guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the second player whose role will
      be swapped.
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object containing both players. Must not be
      null and must contain both specified players.
  returns: Returns true if the roles were successfully swapped between the two players;
    otherwise returns false if either player is not found in the group or if an error
    occurs during the swap operation.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Swap Example
    code: "Group* myGroup = sGroupMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nif (myGroup)\n{\n \
      \   bool success = roleAssignment.SwapRoles(player1Guid, player2Guid, myGroup);\n\
      \    if (success)\n        TC_LOG_INFO(\"server\", \"Roles swapped successfully\
      \ between players %u and %u.\", player1Guid, player2Guid);\n    else\n     \
      \   TC_LOG_ERROR(\"server\", \"Failed to swap roles between players %u and %u.\"\
      , player1Guid, player2Guid);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that both players are members of the provided group.
    The implementation may perform internal validation checks to ensure role consistency.
    It is recommended to verify group membership before calling this method to avoid
    unexpected behavior.
  warnings: Calling this method with invalid GUIDs or a null group pointer can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes. Always validate that both players exist in the
    group before attempting a role swap.
