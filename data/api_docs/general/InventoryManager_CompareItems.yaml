documentation:
  brief: Compares two items and returns a similarity score based on their properties.
  description: The CompareItems method evaluates two Item objects and computes a floating-point
    similarity score between them. This score typically reflects how closely the items
    match in terms of their stats, quality, level, and other relevant attributes.
    The method is commonly used in inventory management systems to determine item
    equivalence or to assist with item sorting and comparison logic. It's particularly
    useful for features such as item upgrades, vendor pricing, and player inventory
    organization. The returned value usually ranges from 0.0 (completely different)
    to 1.0 (identical items).
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the similarity score of
    the two items. A value of 1.0 indicates that the items are identical, while a
    value closer to 0.0 suggests minimal similarity.
  examples:
  - title: Comparing Two Identical Items
    code: 'Item* item1 = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);

      Item* item2 = player->GetItemByPos(0, 0);

      float similarity = inventoryManager->CompareItems(item1, item2);

      // similarity will be 1.0 if items are identical'
    language: cpp
  - title: Comparing Different Items for Inventory Management
    code: "Item* mainHand = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_MAINHAND);\n\
      Item* offHand = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, EQUIPMENT_SLOT_OFFHAND);\n\
      float similarity = inventoryManager->CompareItems(mainHand, offHand);\nif (similarity\
      \ > 0.8f) {\n    // Items are very similar, perhaps suggesting an upgrade\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses internal item comparison logic that considers factors
    such as item level, stats, enchantments, and gem sockets. It may not account for
    temporary buffs or dynamic properties that change during gameplay. The exact implementation
    details depend on how TrinityCore defines item similarity in its core systems.
  warnings: Ensure both Item pointers are valid before calling this method to avoid
    crashes. Null or invalid items can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect comparison
    results.
