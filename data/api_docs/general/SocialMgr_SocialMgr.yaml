  brief: Moves a SocialMgr object to another SocialMgr object using move semantics.
  description: The SocialMgr move constructor transfers ownership of resources from
    one SocialMgr instance to another. This constructor is typically used when transferring
    a SocialMgr object in scenarios such as returning objects from functions or initializing
    new objects with existing ones. The source object is left in a valid but unspecified
    state after the move operation. In the context of TrinityCore's social system,
    this would be used internally for managing player social lists and relationships
    efficiently.

  - title: Move Constructing a SocialMgr
    code: 'SocialMgr sourceMgr;

      // ... populate sourceMgr with data ...

      SocialMgr newMgr = std::move(sourceMgr); // Move constructor in action'
    language: cpp
  notes: This is a move constructor, not a copy constructor. After moving, the original
    object should not be used unless reinitialized. The implementation assumes that
    the moved-from object can be safely left in a valid but unspecified state.
