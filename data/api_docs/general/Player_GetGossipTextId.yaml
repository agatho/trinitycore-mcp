  class: Player
  method: GetGossipTextId
  signature: uint32 Player::GetGossipTextId(int * source)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the gossip text ID associated with the player's current interaction.
  description: The GetGossipTextId method retrieves the unique identifier for the
    gossip text that is currently displayed to the player during a gossip interaction.
    This ID corresponds to the text shown in the gossip window and is used by the
    game engine to determine which dialogue options are available to the player. The
    method typically returns the ID of the last gossip text that was set, usually
    through a call to SetGossipTextId or similar methods. It serves as a getter for
    the current gossip text ID and can be useful for determining what text is being
    displayed during a specific interaction.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns the uint32 identifier of the current gossip text, which corresponds
    to the text shown in the player's gossip window. This ID is typically used by
    the game engine to determine which dialogue options are available to the player
    during a specific interaction.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'uint32 gossipId = player->GetGossipTextId();

      // Use gossipId to determine what text is currently displayed'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be used carefully as it may return different values depending
    on the current state of the player's interaction with NPCs. It is recommended
    that developers use this method in conjunction with other methods like SetGossipTextId
    to ensure consistent behavior.
  warnings: The method may return an incorrect ID if the player is not currently engaged
    in a gossip interaction, or if the interaction has been interrupted by another
    event. Developers should be aware that this method does not guarantee that the
    returned ID corresponds to a valid text entry in the database.
