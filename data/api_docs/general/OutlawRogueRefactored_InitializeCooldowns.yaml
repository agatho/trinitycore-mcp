  method: InitializeCooldowns
  signature: void OutlawRogueRefactored::InitializeCooldowns()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes the cooldown tracking for all abilities used by the Outlaw Rogue
    class.
  description: The InitializeCooldowns method sets up the initial state of all ability
    cooldowns for an Outlaw Rogue character. This method is typically called during
    character initialization or when switching to the Outlaw Rogue specialization.
    It ensures that all relevant abilities start with their correct base cooldown
    values and are properly registered within the rogue's cooldown system. The method
    handles internal setup of cooldown timers, resets any existing cooldown data,
    and prepares the class for proper ability usage during combat. This is a foundational
    method required for accurate spell and ability management in the Outlaw Rogue's
    gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization Call
    code: 'OutlawRogueRefactored rogue;

      rogue.InitializeCooldowns();'
    language: cpp
  - title: Initialization After Class Switch
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nif (player->GetClass() ==\
      \ CLASS_ROGUE)\n{\n    OutlawRogueRefactored* outlawRogue = static_cast<OutlawRogueRefactored*>(player->GetSpecializationClass());\n\
      \    outlawRogue->InitializeCooldowns();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once per character instance during initialization.
    Repeated calls may cause unexpected behavior in cooldown tracking. The method
    assumes that the class has already been properly constructed and initialized with
    necessary player data.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly from combat state as it may interfere
    with existing cooldown management systems. Always ensure the rogue is in a non-combat
    state before calling this initialization routine.
