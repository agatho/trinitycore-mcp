  class: RoleAssignment
  method: AssignRoles
  signature: bool RoleAssignment::AssignRoles(Group * group, RoleAssignmentStrategy
    strategy)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns roles to group members based on the specified role assignment strategy.
  description: The AssignRoles method distributes predefined roles among members of
    a group according to a given strategy. This functionality is typically used in
    World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to manage group compositions for dungeons, raids,
    or other group activities where specific role assignments (such as tank, healer,
    damage dealer) are required. The method evaluates the group composition and applies
    the selected assignment strategy to determine which player assumes which role.
    It returns true if the role assignment was successfully completed, and false otherwise.
    This method may be called during group creation, member addition, or when reorganizing
    group dynamics.
  parameters:
  - name: group
    description: Pointer to the Group object for which roles need to be assigned.
      Must not be null.
  - name: strategy
    description: The RoleAssignmentStrategy enum value that defines how roles should
      be distributed among group members. Valid values are typically TANK, HEALER,
      and DAMAGE.
  returns: True if the role assignment process completed successfully for all eligible
    group members; false if an error occurred or if the assignment could not be applied.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment
    code: "Group* myGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(groupId);\nRoleAssignmentStrategy\
      \ strategy = ROLE_TANK;\nbool success = RoleAssignment::AssignRoles(myGroup,\
      \ strategy);\nif (success)\n{\n    // Roles have been assigned\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Role Assignment Based on Class
    code: "Group* raidGroup = sObjectMgr->GetGroupById(raidId);\nRoleAssignmentStrategy\
      \ strategy = ROLE_DAMAGE;\nbool result = RoleAssignment::AssignRoles(raidGroup,\
      \ strategy);\nif (result)\n{\n    // All damage dealers have been assigned roles\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the group has already been validated and contains
    at least one member. The actual role assignment logic depends on the implementation
    of RoleAssignmentStrategy, which may consider player class, specialization, gear,
    or other factors. The method does not modify the group's internal structure directly
    but rather updates role-related attributes of individual players.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null group pointer will likely result in undefined
    behavior or a crash. Ensure that the group exists and is valid before calling
    AssignRoles. Additionally, repeated calls to this function may overwrite previous
    role assignments without proper state tracking.
