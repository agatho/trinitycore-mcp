  class: BotTalentManager
  method: FindBestLoadout
  signature: uint32 BotTalentManager::FindBestLoadout(uint8 cls, uint8 specId, uint32
    level) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal talent loadout ID for a bot based on class,
    specialization, and level.
  description: The FindBestLoadout method determines the most effective talent build
    for a bot character by evaluating the provided class, specialization ID, and level.
    It considers game balance mechanics, talent point distribution, and class-specific
    optimizations to return a unique loadout identifier that represents the recommended
    talent configuration. This method is typically used during bot initialization
    or when rebalancing bot characters for optimal performance in various combat scenarios.
  parameters:
  - name: cls
    description: The class ID of the bot character (e.g., 1 for Warrior, 2 for Paladin,
      etc.). Valid values correspond to TrinityCore's class constants.
  - name: specId
    description: The specialization ID within the specified class. Each class has
      multiple specializations with distinct talent trees and playstyles. Valid values
      depend on the class and are defined in the game's talent system.
  - name: level
    description: The current level of the bot character, used to determine how many
      talent points should be allocated. Must be a valid player level (typically 1-80
      in most expansions).
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the unique identifier for the calculated
    best talent loadout. This ID corresponds to a predefined set of talents and their
    configurations stored within the bot's talent manager system.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: uint32 loadoutId = botTalentManager->FindBestLoadout(7, 2, 60); // Returns
      best loadout for a Shadow Priest at level 60
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic loadout calculation
    code: 'uint8 playerClass = player->getClass();

      uint8 specId = player->GetPrimaryTalentTree();

      uint32 level = player->getLevel();

      uint32 bestLoadout = botTalentManager->FindBestLoadout(playerClass, specId,
      level);

      // Use bestLoadout to configure bot talents

      '
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely caches previously computed loadouts for performance reasons.
    The implementation may vary depending on the expansion and game version being
    used. It assumes valid inputs and does not perform input validation internally.
  warnings: Ensure that class and specId values are valid for the current game version;
    invalid combinations may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect loadout selection.
    This method should only be called after verifying that the bot has been initialized
    with proper class and level data.
