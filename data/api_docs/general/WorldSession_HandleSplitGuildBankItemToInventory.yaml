    & splitGuildBankItemToInventory)
documentation:
  brief: Splits a guild bank item and moves the specified quantity to the player's
    inventory.
  description: The HandleSplitGuildBankItemToInventory method processes a client request
    to withdraw a portion of an item from the guild bank and place it into the player's
    personal inventory. This action requires that the player has sufficient permissions
    to access the guild bank, and that the requested quantity is valid. The method
    handles validation of the item, quantity, and player's ability to receive the
    items in their inventory. It updates both the guild bank and the player's inventory
    accordingly.
  parameters:
  - name: splitGuildBankItemToInventory
    description: A packet containing information about which guild bank item to split
      and how many to move to inventory.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of splitting a guild bank item
    code: "void WorldSession::HandleSplitGuildBankItemToInventory(WorldPackets::Guild::SplitGuildBankItemToInventory&\
      \ splitGuildBankItemToInventory)\n{\n    // Validate player has access to guild\
      \ bank\n    if (!GetPlayer()->GetGuildId())\n        return;\n\n    // Process\
      \ the split request\n    GetPlayer()->GetSession()->SendPacket(&splitGuildBankItemToInventory);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically invoked when a player interacts with the guild bank
    interface in-game to move items from the guild's shared storage into their own
    inventory. It assumes that the packet has already been validated by the client
    and that the server-side logic handles all necessary checks for item availability,
    quantity limits, and inventory space.
  warnings: Improper handling of this method can lead to inventory desynchronization
    or exploit opportunities if item validation is bypassed. Ensure that all player
    permissions and item constraints are strictly enforced before allowing any item
    movement from guild bank to personal inventory.
