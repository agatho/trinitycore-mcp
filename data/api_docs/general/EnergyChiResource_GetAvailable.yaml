  class: EnergyChiResource
  method: GetAvailable
  signature: uint32 EnergyChiResource::GetAvailable() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the current available energy or chi resource amount for the unit.
  description: The GetAvailable method retrieves the current value of the energy or
    chi resource associated with an EnergyChiResource object. This value typically
    represents how much resource is currently accessible to a player or creature for
    spending on abilities, spells, or other actions that consume energy or chi. The
    returned value is usually clamped between 0 and the maximum resource capacity,
    ensuring it reflects valid resource levels within the game's mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the current available amount of energy or chi
    resource. This value indicates how much resource is currently accessible for use
    by the unit.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Check Available Energy
    code: "uint32 availableEnergy = player->GetPower(POWER_ENERGY);\nif (availableEnergy\
      \ >= 10)\n{\n    // Player can spend 10 energy\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Available Resource for Ability Casting
    code: "EnergyChiResource* resource = unit->GetEnergyChiResource();\nuint32 available\
      \ = resource->GetAvailable();\nif (available >= requiredCost)\n{\n    // Proceed\
      \ with ability casting\n    resource->Cost(requiredCost);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other resource management
    functions to ensure proper handling of energy or chi consumption. It's important
    to note that the returned value may be updated dynamically during gameplay, such
    as when resources regenerate over time or are consumed by abilities.
  warnings: Be aware that this method returns a snapshot of the current resource state
    at the time of calling. If resource values change between calls (e.g., due to
    regeneration or consumption), subsequent calls may return different values. Always
    validate resource availability before spending.
