documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the localized string for a given database entry ID, using the DBC
    locale settings.
  description: The GetTrinityStringForDBCLocale method fetches a localized string
    from the database based on the provided entry identifier. It uses the current
    DBC (Database Client) locale setting to determine which version of the string
    should be returned. This method is typically used for retrieving localized game
    messages, UI text, or other translatable content that has been stored in the database
    with specific entry IDs. The method assumes that the entry ID corresponds to a
    valid localization record in the database and returns a pointer to the string
    data. If no matching entry is found, it may return a default or empty string depending
    on implementation details.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character array containing the localized
    string for the specified DBC locale. Returns NULL if the entry ID does not correspond
    to any valid localization record in the database.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve a localized message
    code: "const char* message = sObjectMgr->GetTrinityStringForDBCLocale(12345);\n\
      if (message != nullptr)\n{\n    printf(\"Localized Message: %s\\n\", message);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    printf(\"No localization found for entry 12345.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal database localization system and assumes
    that DBC locale settings are properly initialized. The returned string is managed
    by the ObjectMgr class and should not be freed by the caller. Performance may
    vary depending on how many localization entries are cached in memory.
  warnings: Do not assume that all entry IDs will return valid strings; always check
    for NULL returns. Incorrect usage of this method with invalid entry IDs can lead
    to undefined behavior or crashes if not handled properly.
