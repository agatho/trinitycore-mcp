  class: LootItem
  method: AddAllowedLooter
  signature: void LootItem::AddAllowedLooter(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Adds a player to the list of allowed looters for this loot item.
  description: The AddAllowedLooter method registers a specific player as being permitted
    to receive loot from this LootItem instance. This functionality is typically used
    in the context of World of Warcraft's loot system, where certain items may be
    restricted to specific players or groups based on criteria such as group membership,
    quest requirements, or loot distribution rules. The method updates internal tracking
    within the LootItem object to include the provided player in its allowed looters
    list. This ensures that when loot is distributed, only players who have been added
    via this method will be considered eligible for receiving the item.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object that should be added as an allowed
      looter. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding a Player to Allowed Looters
    code: 'LootItem* lootItem = new LootItem();

      Player* player = ...; // Assume valid player pointer

      lootItem->AddAllowedLooter(player);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely modifies internal data structures within the LootItem
    class to maintain a list of allowed players. It is expected that this operation
    is performed before loot distribution begins, and may be called multiple times
    with different players to build up the complete list of eligible recipients.
