  signature: void DeathKnightAI::UpdatePresenceIfNeeded()
documentation:
  brief: Updates the Death Knight's presence state based on current combat conditions
    and spell availability.
  description: The UpdatePresenceIfNeeded method manages the transition between different
    Death Knight presences (Blood, Frost, Unholy) by evaluating the current combat
    situation, available spells, and player resource levels. This method ensures that
    the Death Knight automatically switches to the most appropriate presence for optimal
    damage output or survivability. It typically checks if the current presence is
    still beneficial given the enemy's health, cooldowns of key abilities, and the
    player's current mana or runic power. The method does not directly change presence
    but rather determines whether a transition should occur based on game logic and
    AI decision-making.

  - title: Basic Usage in AI Update Loop
    code: "void DeathKnightAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic\
      \ ...\n    UpdatePresenceIfNeeded();\n    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and may be invoked
    multiple times per second. It relies on internal state tracking of the Death Knight's
    current presence, spell cooldowns, and combat context to make decisions. The implementation
    likely uses a priority system to determine which presence is most beneficial at
    any given moment.
