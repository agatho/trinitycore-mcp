  class: Player
  method: GetGlyphs
  signature: int & Player::GetGlyphs(uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the glyph data for the specified player specialization.
  description: This method retrieves the glyph information associated with a specific
    player specialization. Glyphs are special abilities that enhance character abilities
    and provide unique benefits based on the selected talent tree. The method returns
    an integer reference representing the glyph data, which can be used to determine
    the current glyph configuration for the specified spec. This functionality is
    essential for managing player character progression and ensuring proper glyph
    assignment during gameplay.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a reference to an integer value representing the glyph data for
    the specified specialization. The value typically contains information about which
    glyphs are active or available for the given spec, with possible values including
    0 (no glyphs), positive integers (glyphs in use), or negative integers (glyphs
    not yet unlocked).
  examples:
  - title: Basic glyph retrieval example
    code: "int& glyphData = player->GetGlyphs(0);\nif (glyphData > 0)\n{\n    // Glyphs\
      \ are active\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced glyph management example
    code: "Player* player;\nint& glyphData = player->GetGlyphs(1);\nif (glyphData\
      \ == 0)\n{\n    // No glyphs assigned to spec 1\n}\nelse if (glyphData > 0)\n\
      {\n    // Glyphs are active, check for specific glyph IDs\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method is typically used in conjunction with player specialization management
    and should be called only when the player's spec has been properly initialized.
    The return value may vary depending on the current game state and player's glyph
    status. This method does not directly modify the player's glyph data but rather
    returns a reference to it.
  warnings: The method may return unexpected values if called before player initialization
    or during special circumstances such as during character creation. Care should
    be taken when using this method in conjunction with other glyph-related functions
    to avoid conflicts or incorrect data interpretation.
