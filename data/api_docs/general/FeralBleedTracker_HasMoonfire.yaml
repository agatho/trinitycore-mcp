documentation:
  brief: Checks if a player has the Moonfire spell active.
  description: The HasMoonfire method determines whether a specific player, identified
    by their GUID, currently has the Moonfire spell applied to them. This is typically
    used in feral druid combat logic to track debuffs and manage spell usage. The
    method performs a lookup within the internal tracking system of the FeralBleedTracker
    class to verify the presence of the Moonfire effect on the specified target.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player with the given GUID has the Moonfire spell active;
    otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Player Has Moonfire
    code: "if (feralBleedTracker.HasMoonfire(playerGuid)) {\n    // Player is affected\
      \ by Moonfire\n    // Apply appropriate logic here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the internal state management of the FeralBleedTracker
    class. It assumes that the tracker maintains a mapping or list of active debuffs
    for players, and that the GUID parameter correctly identifies a valid player in
    the game world.
