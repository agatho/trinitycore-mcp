  class: QuestValidation
  method: ValidateWithContext
  signature: bool QuestValidation::ValidateWithContext(ValidationContext & context)
documentation:
  brief: Validates quest data within the provided validation context and returns true
    if all checks pass.
  description: The ValidateWithContext method performs a comprehensive validation
    of quest-related data using the information contained in the ValidationContext
    parameter. It evaluates various aspects of quest integrity, such as required objectives,
    reward consistency, and logical dependencies between quest steps. This method
    is typically invoked during quest processing or when validating quest states to
    ensure that quests conform to expected game mechanics and data structures. The
    validation process may include checking for missing or invalid quest items, verifying
    prerequisite conditions, ensuring proper quest progression logic, and confirming
    that all required fields are populated with valid values. The method returns true
    if all validations succeed, indicating the quest data is consistent and ready
    for use in the game world.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if all validation checks pass successfully, indicating that
    the quest data within the context is valid and conforms to expected game mechanics.
    Returns false if any validation fails, signaling that the quest data contains
    inconsistencies or invalid entries that need correction before being processed
    further.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Quest Validation
    code: "ValidationContext context;\n// Populate context with quest data\nbool isValid\
      \ = QuestValidation::ValidateWithContext(context);\nif (isValid)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with quest processing\n    LOG_INFO(\"quest\", \"Quest validation\
      \ passed for quest ID: {}\", context.GetQuestId());\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ invalid quest data\n    LOG_ERROR(\"quest\", \"Quest validation failed for\
      \ quest ID: {}\", context.GetQuestId());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is designed to be lightweight and efficient, performing only
    necessary checks without heavy database or network operations. It should not modify
    the input context data but rather inspect it for correctness. The validation logic
    may evolve with game updates, so developers should be prepared to handle new validation
    rules that might be added in future versions.
  warnings: Do not assume that a successful validation means the quest is fully functional
    in-game; additional runtime checks may still be required. This method does not
    perform any database writes or state changes - it only validates existing data.
    Be cautious when using this method in performance-critical code paths as it may
    perform multiple checks that could add up under high load.
