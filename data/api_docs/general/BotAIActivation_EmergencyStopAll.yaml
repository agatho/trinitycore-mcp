documentation:
  brief: Stops all active bot AI behaviors immediately
  description: The EmergencyStopAll method terminates all currently running AI behaviors
    for all bots within the system. This method is designed to provide an immediate
    halt to any ongoing bot activities, such as movement, combat, or quest-related
    actions. It's typically used during critical game events, server maintenance,
    or when debugging bot behavior. The method ensures that all bot AI states are
    reset and that no pending actions continue execution. This function does not preserve
    the previous state of bots, meaning they will need to be reinitialized or reactivated
    to resume normal operation.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Game Event Handler
    code: "void OnServerShutdown()\n{\n    BotAIActivation::EmergencyStopAll();\n\
      \    // All bots are now stopped and their AI states reset\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using During Debugging Session
    code: "void DebugCommandStopBots()\n{\n    sLog->outString(\"Stopping all bot\
      \ AI behaviors...\");\n    BotAIActivation::EmergencyStopAll();\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      All bots have been stopped.\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates synchronously and will block until all active bot AI
    threads are properly terminated. It is recommended to call this method from the
    main game thread to avoid potential race conditions or undefined behavior. The
    method does not send any notifications to players about the bot stoppage, so additional
    handling may be required if player feedback is needed.
  warnings: Using EmergencyStopAll() during active combat scenarios may result in
    unexpected behavior or state corruption if bots are mid-combat action. It should
    only be used when absolutely necessary and with proper game state management.
    This method does not perform any cleanup of bot-specific resources, which may
    lead to memory leaks if called frequently without proper resource management.
