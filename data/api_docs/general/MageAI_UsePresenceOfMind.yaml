documentation:
  brief: Activates the Mage's Presence of Mind ability to reduce spell cooldowns.
  description: The UsePresenceOfMind method triggers the Mage's Presence of Mind talent,
    which reduces the cooldown of the next damaging spell cast by 10 seconds. This
    ability is typically used strategically during combat to maximize damage output
    by allowing a high-damage spell to be cast immediately after a shorter cooldown
    spell. The method does not directly cast a spell but instead applies a temporary
    buff that modifies the cooldown mechanics of subsequent spells.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Mage AI
    code: "void MyMageAI::OnCombatStart()\n{\n    // Activate Presence of Mind at\
      \ start of combat\n    UsePresenceOfMind();\n}\n\nvoid MyMageAI::CastSpellWhenReady()\n\
      {\n    if (HasCooldownExpired())\n    {\n        // This spell will benefit\
      \ from reduced cooldown\n        CastSpell(SPELL_FIREBALL);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the Mage has the Presence of Mind
    talent unlocked. The effect lasts for the duration of one spell cast, after which
    the cooldown reduction is consumed. It's recommended to call this method before
    casting a high-damage spell that would benefit most from reduced cooldown.
  warnings: Calling this method without checking for the talent or proper combat state
    may result in unexpected behavior. The cooldown reduction only applies to the
    next damaging spell cast, so timing is crucial for optimal damage output.
