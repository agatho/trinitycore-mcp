  signature: void Player::UpdateObjectVisibility(bool forced)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the visibility state of the player object for nearby entities
  description: The UpdateObjectVisibility method recalculates and broadcasts the visibility
    status of a player object to surrounding players and creatures in the game world.
    This method ensures that the player's presence is properly communicated to nearby
    entities, taking into account factors such as stealth, invisibility, fog of war,
    and other visibility-related game mechanics. The method can be forced to update
    immediately regardless of normal update intervals, which is useful for situations
    where immediate visibility changes are required, such as when a player becomes
    visible after being invisible or when teleporting to a new location. This method
    is typically called internally by the core engine during regular world updates
    but can also be invoked manually when explicit visibility control is needed.
  parameters:
  - name: forced
    description: When true, forces an immediate visibility update regardless of normal
      update timing. When false, performs a standard visibility update based on current
      game state and update intervals.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Force immediate visibility update
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateObjectVisibility(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Perform standard visibility update
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      player->UpdateObjectVisibility(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called automatically by the core engine during regular
    world updates. The forced parameter should be used sparingly as it bypasses normal
    update timing and may impact performance if called excessively. The method internally
    handles all visibility calculations including checking for stealth, invisibility,
    and other game state factors that affect object visibility.
  warnings: Calling this method with forced=true too frequently can cause performance
    issues due to excessive network traffic and processing overhead. Avoid calling
    this method in tight loops or high-frequency update contexts unless absolutely
    necessary.
