  method: GetGarrison
  signature: Garrison * Player::GetGarrison() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the player's garrison instance, allowing access to garrison-related
    data and functionality.
  description: The GetG Garrison method returns a pointer to the player's current
    garrison instance. This method provides access to the garrison structure which
    contains information about the player's garrison building, plot, and related mechanics.
    The returned garrison object can be used to retrieve garrison data such as building
    positions, plot information, and other garrison-related functionality. This method
    is essential for players who wish to interact with their garrison in the game
    world, including managing buildings, plots, and other garrison activities.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the player's garrison instance. If the player does
    not have a garrison or it has not been initialized, this method may return nullptr.
    The returned garrison object contains all relevant garrison data and can be used
    for further operations like building management, plot selection, and other garrison-related
    activities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nGarrison* garrison = player->GetGarrison();\nif\
      \ (garrison != nullptr)\n{\n    // Use garrison data\n    // Example: garrison->GetPlotID()\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other garrison-related
    methods. The returned garrison object may be null if the player has not yet acquired
    a garrison or if it hasn't been initialized properly. Performance considerations
    should be taken into account when using this method frequently, as it involves
    accessing player data structures.
  warnings: This method should not be used in situations where the player's garrison
    hasn't been initialized. Using this method on uninitialized players may lead to
    crashes or undefined behavior. Always check for null before using the returned
    garrison object.
