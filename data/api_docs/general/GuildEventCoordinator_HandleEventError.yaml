  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::HandleEventError(uint32 eventId, const std::string
    & error)
documentation:
  brief: Handles and logs errors that occur during guild event processing.
  description: The HandleEventError method is responsible for managing error conditions
    that arise while processing guild events within the TrinityCore framework. It
    takes an event identifier and an error message, then performs appropriate logging
    and error handling operations to ensure that guild event failures are properly
    recorded and managed. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity
    of guild-related activities by providing structured error reporting for debugging
    and monitoring purposes.
  parameters:
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the guild event that encountered an error.
      This value is used to track which specific event failed during processing.
  - name: error
    description: A string containing the detailed error message describing what went
      wrong during the guild event execution. This message should be descriptive enough
      for debugging purposes.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Error Handling Example
    code: "void SomeGuildEvent::Execute()\n{\n    // ... some processing logic ...\n\
      \    if (someCondition)\n    {\n        GuildEventCoordinator::HandleEventError(12345,\
      \ \"Failed to allocate guild resources\");\n        return;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Error Handling with Logging
    code: "void GuildEventManager::ProcessGuildEvent(uint32 eventId)\n{\n    try\n\
      \    {\n        // ... event processing logic ...\n        if (!ValidateEventRequirements())\n\
      \        {\n            GuildEventCoordinator::HandleEventError(eventId, \"\
      Insufficient permissions for guild event\");\n            return;\n        }\n\
      \    }\n    catch (const std::exception& ex)\n    {\n        GuildEventCoordinator::HandleEventError(eventId,\
      \ std::string(\"Exception occurred: \") + ex.what());\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called from within guild event handlers to report
    failures. The implementation should be thread-safe as guild events may be processed
    concurrently. It's recommended that error messages include sufficient context
    for debugging purposes.
  warnings: Ensure that eventId values are valid and unique for proper tracking. Avoid
    calling this method with empty or null error strings as it may lead to unclear
    logging output.
