  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: GetMaximumRange
  signature: float PositionStrategyBase::GetMaximumRange()
documentation:
  brief: Returns the maximum range value configured for the position strategy.
  description: The GetMaximumRange method retrieves the upper limit of the spatial
    range that this position strategy is allowed to consider when calculating valid
    positions. This value typically defines the furthest distance from a reference
    point (such as a unit or object) that the strategy will evaluate for positioning
    purposes. It's commonly used in AI pathfinding, targeting logic, and spatial awareness
    systems within the TrinityCore framework. The method does not perform any calculations
    or modifications; it simply returns a pre-configured value stored within the strategy
    instance.
  parameters: []
  returns: A float value representing the maximum range in game units (typically yards
    or meters). This value defines the boundary beyond which positions are considered
    invalid or irrelevant by the strategy.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "float maxRange = positionStrategy->GetMaximumRange();\nif (maxRange > 0.0f)\n\
      {\n    // Use maxRange for distance checks\n    printf(\"Maximum range is: %.2f\\\
      n\", maxRange);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Position Validation
    code: "float maxRange = positionStrategy->GetMaximumRange();\nfloat distanceToTarget\
      \ = unit->GetDistance(target);\nif (distanceToTarget <= maxRange)\n{\n    //\
      \ Proceed with positioning logic\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Target is out of range\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other position strategy
    methods like GetMinimumRange() or GetOptimalRange(). The returned value should
    be treated as a constant for the lifetime of the strategy instance unless explicitly
    modified through setter methods. It's important to note that this range may be
    used in distance calculations, so units should be consistent with the coordinate
    system used by the game world.
  warnings: Ensure that the maximum range is properly initialized before calling this
    method. If the strategy has not been configured correctly, this value might be
    zero or negative, which could lead to incorrect behavior in range-based checks.
    Also, be aware that this value does not account for obstacles or line-of-sight
    restrictions; it only represents a straight-line distance boundary.
