documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the item level of the item that cast the aura.
  description: The GetCastItemLevel method returns the item level associated with
    the item that was used to cast the aura. This value is typically set when an item
    with a spell effect is equipped or used, and it represents the quality or power
    level of that item. The returned value can be used for various game mechanics
    such as scaling effects, determining whether an aura should be applied based on
    item strength, or calculating bonuses depending on the item's properties. This
    method does not require any parameters and will always return a valid integer
    representing the item level.
  parameters: []
  returns: An int32 value representing the item level of the casting item. A negative
    value may indicate that no item was used to cast the aura or that the item level
    is not set.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(12345);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int32 itemLevel\
      \ = aura->GetCastItemLevel();\n    if (itemLevel > 0)\n        sLog->outString(\"\
      Aura cast by item with level: %d\", itemLevel);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Effect Based on Item Level
    code: "Aura* aura = player->GetAura(67890);\nif (aura)\n{\n    int32 itemLevel\
      \ = aura->GetCastItemLevel();\n    if (itemLevel >= 100)\n        player->AddAura(99999,\
      \ player); // Apply enhanced effect\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the aura's internal data structure to store and retrieve
    the item level. It is important to ensure that the aura was indeed cast by an
    item, otherwise the returned value may not be meaningful. The method is thread-safe
    as it only reads from existing aura data.
  warnings: Be cautious when using this method without verifying that the aura actually
    originated from an item. If the aura was cast directly by a spell or ability rather
    than an item, the returned value might not reflect the intended behavior and could
    lead to incorrect calculations.
