documentation:
  brief: Notifies all registered scripts that the server is shutting down
  description: The OnShutdown method is invoked during the server shutdown process
    to allow script modules to perform cleanup operations before the server terminates.
    This method serves as a callback mechanism for scripts to handle graceful shutdown
    procedures, such as saving player data, closing connections, or releasing resources.
    It is called once during the shutdown sequence and provides an opportunity for
    custom scripts to execute finalization logic. The method does not accept any parameters
    and does not return a value.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Shutdown Notification
    code: "void MyScript::OnShutdown()\n{\n    // Perform cleanup tasks\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      MyScript: Cleaning up before shutdown\");\n    // Save data, close files, etc.\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is called during the server's shutdown sequence and should not
    be used for time-consuming operations as it may block the shutdown process. Scripts
    should ensure their cleanup logic is efficient and does not introduce delays.
