  class: TargetAssistAction
  method: GetStats
  signature: const AssistStats & TargetAssistAction::GetStats() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the assist statistics for the target assist action.
  description: The GetStats method retrieves a constant reference to the AssistStats
    structure that contains statistical information about the target assist action.
    This includes data such as the number of assists performed, success rates, and
    other relevant metrics related to how effectively the action is assisting targets.
    The returned structure is immutable, ensuring that external code cannot modify
    internal statistics directly. This method is typically used in AI decision-making
    processes where performance tracking or behavior analysis of assist actions is
    required.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to an AssistStats object containing statistical data
    about the target assist action, including metrics such as assist count, success
    rate, and timing information.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Assist Statistics
    code: 'const AssistStats& stats = targetAssistAction.GetStats();

      uint32 assistCount = stats.assist_count;

      float successRate = stats.success_rate;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned reference points to internal data managed by the TargetAssistAction
    instance. Modifying the AssistStats structure through this reference is not recommended
    and may lead to undefined behavior. The statistics are updated internally during
    action execution and should be accessed after relevant operations have completed.
  warnings: Accessing the returned reference after the TargetAssistAction object has
    been destroyed results in a dangling pointer. Ensure that the TargetAssistAction
    instance remains valid for as long as you're using the returned reference.
