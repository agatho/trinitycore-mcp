documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the initialization data for the shared instance lock.
  description: The GetInstanceInitializationData method returns a constant pointer
    to an InstanceLockData structure that contains initialization information for
    the shared instance lock. This data typically includes details such as the instance
    ID, lock status, and other metadata required for managing access to shared instances
    within the game world. The returned pointer is valid only while the SharedInstanceLock
    object remains in scope and should not be modified by the caller. This method
    is commonly used during instance creation or when checking the current state of
    an instance lock before performing operations that require synchronization.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant pointer to an InstanceLockData structure containing initialization
    data for the shared instance lock, or nullptr if no initialization data is available.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "SharedInstanceLock* lock = GetSharedInstanceLock();\nconst InstanceLockData*\
      \ initData = lock->GetInstanceInitializationData();\nif (initData != nullptr)\n\
      {\n    // Use the initialization data\n    uint32 instanceId = initData->instanceId;\n\
      \    // ... process instance data\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Instance Lock Validation Example
    code: "SharedInstanceLock* lock = GetSharedInstanceLock();\nconst InstanceLockData*\
      \ initData = lock->GetInstanceInitializationData();\nif (initData && initData->instanceId\
      \ != 0)\n{\n    // Proceed with instance-specific logic\n    LOG_INFO(\"world\"\
      , \"Initializing instance {}\", initData->instanceId);\n}\nelse\n{\n    LOG_ERROR(\"\
      world\", \"Failed to retrieve valid instance initialization data\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned InstanceLockData pointer is read-only and should not be modified.
    The data structure may be invalidated if the SharedInstanceLock object is destroyed
    or reinitialized. This method does not perform any locking operations itself,
    so concurrent access to the returned data should be handled by the caller if needed.
  warnings: Do not assume that the returned pointer will remain valid beyond the lifetime
    of the SharedInstanceLock object. Always check for null returns before dereferencing
    the pointer. Modifying the returned InstanceLockData structure directly can lead
    to undefined behavior and corruption of internal state.
