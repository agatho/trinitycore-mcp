  class: PositionStrategyBase
  method: IsPathClear
  signature: bool PositionStrategyBase::IsPathClear(const int & start, const int &
    end) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a clear path exists between two points in the game world.
  description: The IsPathClear method evaluates whether there is an unobstructed line
    of sight or navigable path between two specified positions within the game world.
    This method is commonly used by AI systems, movement planners, and pathfinding
    algorithms to determine if entities can move directly from one location to another
    without colliding with terrain, objects, or other obstacles. The method typically
    performs collision detection and navigation mesh checks to ensure accurate results.
    It's essential for proper NPC behavior, spell targeting, and character movement
    logic in World of Warcraft environments.
  parameters:
  - name: start
    description: The starting position index or identifier used to locate the beginning
      point of the path check.
  - name: end
    description: The ending position index or identifier used to locate the endpoint
      of the path check.
  returns: Returns true if a clear, unobstructed path exists between the start and
    end positions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Path Clear Check
    code: "if (positionStrategy.IsPathClear(10, 20)) {\n    // Proceed with movement\
      \ or action\n    player->MoveTo(20);\n} else {\n    // Find alternative route\n\
      \    player->SetTargetPosition(15);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Path Clear Check in AI Decision Making
    code: "bool canAttack = positionStrategy.IsPathClear(player->GetGUID(), target->GetGUID());\n\
      if (canAttack) {\n    player->CastSpell(target, SPELL_SHOOT);\n} else {\n  \
      \  // Move closer or find a different approach\n    player->MoveTowards(target,\
      \ 5.0f);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the underlying navigation system and collision detection
    of the TrinityCore engine. Performance may be impacted when checking many path
    queries in rapid succession. The method assumes that start and end parameters
    are valid indices or identifiers within the current navigation context.
  warnings: Ensure that the start and end positions are properly initialized before
    calling this method, as invalid indices could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
    This method does not account for dynamic obstacles that may appear during execution;
    it only checks static path conditions at the time of call.
