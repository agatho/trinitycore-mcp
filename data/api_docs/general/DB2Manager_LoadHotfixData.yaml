  class: DB2Manager
  method: LoadHotfixData
  signature: void DB2Manager::LoadHotfixData(uint32 localeMask)
documentation:
  brief: Loads hotfix data for the specified locale mask into the DB2 manager.
  description: The LoadHotfixData method initializes and loads hotfix data from the
    database into memory for the specified locale mask. This method is typically invoked
    during server startup or when locale-specific data needs to be updated. It processes
    and stores hotfix records that override default game data, enabling dynamic content
    updates without requiring a full server restart. The method ensures that all DB2
    files are properly synchronized with the latest hotfix information for the given
    locale.
  parameters:
  - name: localeMask
    description: A bitmask representing the locales for which hotfix data should be
      loaded. Each bit corresponds to a specific locale, allowing selective loading
      of localized content.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Load hotfix data for all locales
    code: DB2Manager::Instance()->LoadHotfixData(0xFFFFFFFF);
    language: cpp
  - title: Load hotfix data for English and French locales only
    code: DB2Manager::Instance()->LoadHotfixData(LOCALE_en | LOCALE_fr);
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after the database connection is established
    but before any game data is accessed. The hotfix data loading process may take
    several seconds depending on the number of records and locale complexity.
  warnings: Calling this method multiple times with different locale masks may cause
    data inconsistencies. Ensure that all DB2 files are properly closed or flushed
    before invoking this method to prevent memory leaks or corrupted data.
