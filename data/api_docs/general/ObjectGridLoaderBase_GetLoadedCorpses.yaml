  signature: uint32 ObjectGridLoaderBase::GetLoadedCorpses() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the count of corpses loaded in the current grid.
  description: The GetLoadedCorpses method retrieves the total number of corpse objects
    that have been loaded and are currently present within the grid associated with
    this ObjectGridLoaderBase instance. This method is typically used during grid
    loading/unloading operations to track the state of corpse data in memory. The
    returned count represents corpses that are actively managed by the grid's object
    loader and may include both player and creature corpses depending on the grid's
    configuration and loaded data.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the number of corpses currently loaded in the
    grid. Returns zero if no corpses are loaded or if the grid has not been initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Check corpse count before grid unload
    code: "uint32 corpseCount = loader->GetLoadedCorpses();\nif (corpseCount > 0)\n\
      {\n    sLog->outString(\"Grid contains %u corpses, preparing for cleanup.\"\
      , corpseCount);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method provides a quick way to assess the memory footprint of corpse
    data in a grid. It's particularly useful for garbage collection and memory management
    routines. The count returned reflects only those corpses that have been fully
    loaded into memory, not those pending load or marked for deletion.
