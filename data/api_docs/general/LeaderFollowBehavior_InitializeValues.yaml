  method: InitializeValues
  signature: void LeaderFollowBehavior::InitializeValues()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes internal values and state for the leader follow behavior AI module.
  description: The InitializeValues method sets up the initial configuration and state
    variables required for the LeaderFollowBehavior AI system. This includes initializing
    follower tracking parameters, setting default movement behaviors, configuring
    distance thresholds, and preparing internal data structures needed for leader-following
    mechanics. The method is typically called during the initialization phase of an
    AI-controlled unit's lifecycle to ensure all necessary values are properly configured
    before the behavior begins executing. It prepares the system for tracking a designated
    leader and maintaining appropriate follow distances and formations.
  parameters: []
  returns: null

  - title: Basic Initialization Usage
    code: "void MyAIUnit::OnInitialize()\n{\n    leaderFollowBehavior.InitializeValues();\n\
      \    // Behavior is now ready for use\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called once during the object's initialization
    phase. Repeated calls may result in undefined behavior or state corruption. The
    method does not perform any dynamic allocation and operates entirely on stack-based
    or pre-allocated memory.
  warnings: Do not call this method after the behavior has already been actively used,
    as it may reset critical internal state and cause inconsistent follower behavior.
    Ensure the leader unit reference is valid before calling this method if the behavior
    depends on leader presence.
