  brief: Initializes the ManagerRegistry singleton instance
  description: The ManagerRegistry constructor initializes the singleton registry
    used to manage various game systems and managers within the TrinityCore server.
    This method sets up internal data structures and registers core managers such
    as player, creature, and GameObject managers. It is automatically called during
    server startup and should not be invoked manually by developers. The registry
    ensures thread-safe access to registered managers throughout the game loop.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Server Startup Initialization
    code: '// This constructor is automatically invoked during TrinityCore server
      startup

      // No manual invocation required

      ManagerRegistry* registry = ManagerRegistry::instance();

      // The registry is now ready for use throughout the server lifecycle'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a private constructor and should only be called through the
    singleton pattern. The registry maintains thread-safe access to registered managers
    using appropriate locking mechanisms. Developers should not instantiate ManagerRegistry
    directly.
