documentation:
  brief: Initializes the hunter baseline rotation system with default settings and
    configurations.
  description: The InitializeHunterBaseline method sets up the foundational configuration
    for a hunter's baseline rotation behavior within the TrinityCore AI framework.
    This method typically configures default spell priorities, cooldown management,
    and combat state handling specific to hunter classes. It ensures that the rotation
    manager has all necessary data structures and settings initialized before any
    combat decisions are made. The method is generally called during the initialization
    phase of a hunter's AI controller or when switching between different rotation
    strategies.

  notes: This method should only be called once during the initialization of a hunter's
    AI system. Reinitialization may lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts in rotation
    management.
