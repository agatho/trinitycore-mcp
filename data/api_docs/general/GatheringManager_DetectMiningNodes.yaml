  class: GatheringManager
  method: DetectMiningNodes
  signature: int GatheringManager::DetectMiningNodes(float range)
documentation:
  brief: Detects and returns the number of mining nodes within a specified range.
  description: The DetectMiningNodes method scans the surrounding area for mining
    nodes (ore veins) within the given range and returns the count of such nodes.
    This method is typically used by players or NPCs with mining abilities to locate
    nearby resources. The detection logic considers the player's current position
    and checks for valid mining node objects in the vicinity. It does not modify any
    game state directly but provides information about available resources for gathering.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the number of mining nodes detected within the
    specified range. Returns 0 if no nodes are found or if an error occurs during
    detection.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: int nodeCount = gatheringManager->DetectMiningNodes(10.0f);
    language: cpp
  - title: Check for Nearby Resources
    code: "if (gatheringManager->DetectMiningNodes(5.0f) > 0) {\n    // Player can\
      \ mine nearby resources\n    printf(\"Mining nodes detected nearby!\\n\");\n\
      } else {\n    // No mining nodes found in range\n    printf(\"No mining nodes\
      \ found in range.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely uses spatial queries or collision detection to identify
    valid mining node objects within the specified range. It may be optimized for
    performance by caching previous results or using bounding volume hierarchies.
    The range parameter defines a spherical area around the player or object invoking
    the method.
  warnings: Ensure that the range parameter is a positive value; negative ranges may
    cause unexpected behavior or errors. This method should not be called excessively
    in tight loops without considering performance implications, especially in high-frequency
    scenarios like automated botting.
