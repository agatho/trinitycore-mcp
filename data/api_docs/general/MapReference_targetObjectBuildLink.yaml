  brief: Establishes a link between the referenced object and its target map in the
    TrinityCore server architecture.
  description: The MapReference::targetObjectBuildLink method is responsible for creating
    or updating the association between a reference object and its associated map
    within the TrinityCore framework. This method ensures that the reference maintains
    proper linkage to the target map, which is essential for maintaining object visibility,
    positioning, and spatial awareness in the game world. It typically gets invoked
    during object initialization or when a map change occurs, ensuring that all references
    are correctly bound to their respective maps. The method operates on internal
    reference structures and does not expose direct external interfaces.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in object initialization
    code: 'MapReference* ref = new MapReference();

      ref->targetObjectBuildLink(); // Establishes the link between reference and
      target map'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of an internal linking mechanism used by TrinityCore's
    map management system. It should not be called directly from game logic unless
    implementing custom map reference behavior. The method assumes that the MapReference
    object has been properly initialized with valid target data.
