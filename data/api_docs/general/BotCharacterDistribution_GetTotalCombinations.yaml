  class: BotCharacterDistribution
  method: GetTotalCombinations
  signature: uint32 BotCharacterDistribution::GetTotalCombinations() const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the total number of possible character combinations
    for bot distribution.
  description: The GetTotalCombinations method computes the total count of all possible
    unique character arrangements that can be generated within the bot character distribution
    system. This value represents the mathematical product of all available options
    across different character attributes such as race, class, gender, and other configurable
    parameters. The method is typically used to determine the size of the character
    pool from which bots are randomly selected during bot creation or reassignment
    processes. It serves as a foundational value for probability calculations and
    distribution algorithms within the TrinityCore bot management system.
  parameters: []
  returns: "Returns a uint32 value representing the total number of possible unique\
    \ character combinations that can be generated based on current configuration\
    \ settings. This value is calculated by multiplying together all available options\
    \ for each configurable character attribute (e.g., number of races \xD7 number\
    \ of classes \xD7 number of genders \xD7 etc.)."
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 totalCombinations = botDistribution->GetTotalCombinations();\nif\
      \ (totalCombinations > 0)\n{\n    std::cout << \"Total possible bot combinations:\
      \ \" << totalCombinations << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage in Bot Creation Logic
    code: 'BotCharacterDistribution* distribution = sObjectMgr->GetBotCharacterDistribution();

      uint32 maxCombinations = distribution->GetTotalCombinations();

      uint32 randomIndex = urand(0, maxCombinations - 1);

      // Use randomIndex to select a specific bot character combination

      Player* bot = CreateBotFromCombination(randomIndex);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a mathematical calculation based on current distribution
    configuration and does not involve any database queries or external dependencies.
    The result is cached internally and recalculated only when the underlying distribution
    settings change, making it efficient for repeated calls during bot management
    operations.
  warnings: The returned value may be zero if no valid character combinations exist
    due to misconfiguration (e.g., no available races or classes). Always validate
    that the return value is greater than zero before using it in indexing operations
    to avoid potential division-by-zero errors or invalid memory access.
