documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the area trigger teleport associated with a specific map's entrance.
  description: The GetMapEntranceTrigger method fetches the AreaTriggerTeleport object
    that defines the teleportation point used when players enter a specific map. This
    is commonly utilized for handling map transitions, such as entering dungeons or
    instances from the main world. The method performs a lookup based on the provided
    map ID and returns a pointer to the corresponding area trigger teleport structure.
    If no entrance trigger is defined for the specified map, it will return a null
    pointer.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to an AreaTriggerTeleport object representing the entrance teleport
    trigger for the specified map, or nullptr if none exists.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve and use map entrance trigger
    code: "const AreaTriggerTeleport* entrance = sObjectMgr->GetMapEntranceTrigger(1234);\n\
      if (entrance)\n{\n    // Use the teleport data to handle player entry\n    TC_LOG_INFO(\"\
      server\", \"Found entrance trigger for map %u at position (%f, %f, %f)\",\n\
      \                entrance->MapID, entrance->TargetX, entrance->TargetY, entrance->TargetZ);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during player login or map transition logic.
    It's important to note that the returned pointer may be null if no valid entrance
    trigger exists for the requested map ID.
  warnings: Ensure that the map ID passed into this function corresponds to a valid
    map in the game world; otherwise, it will return a null pointer. Also, be cautious
    about using the returned pointer without checking for null, as dereferencing a
    null pointer can cause crashes.
