  class: AIDecisionProfiler
  method: ImportDecisionData
  signature: void AIDecisionProfiler::ImportDecisionData(const std::string & filename)
documentation:
  brief: Imports AI decision data from a specified file for profiling and analysis.
  description: The ImportDecisionData method loads AI decision-making data from a
    given file, typically used for performance profiling or debugging purposes within
    the TrinityCore framework. This method allows developers to analyze how AI entities
    make decisions during gameplay, which can be crucial for balancing NPC behavior
    and identifying performance bottlenecks. The imported data may include timing
    information, decision trees, or other metrics related to AI processing. The method
    does not return any value but modifies internal profiling state within the AIDecisionProfiler
    class.
  parameters:
  - name: filename
    description: The path to the file containing AI decision data to be imported.
      This should be a valid file path accessible by the server process, typically
      containing structured data such as JSON or CSV formatted for AI profiling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'AIDecisionProfiler profiler;

      profiler.ImportDecisionData("ai_decisions.json");'
    language: cpp
  - title: Usage with Error Handling
    code: "AIDecisionProfiler profiler;\ntry {\n    profiler.ImportDecisionData(\"\
      /var/log/ai_data.csv\");\n} catch (const std::exception& e) {\n    TC_LOG_ERROR(\"\
      ai\", \"Failed to import AI decision data: %s\", e.what());\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the input file is properly formatted and accessible.
    It may throw exceptions if the file cannot be read or parsed correctly. The imported
    data will be used in subsequent profiling operations, so it's important to ensure
    that the file contains valid AI decision records.
  warnings: Ensure that the filename parameter points to a secure and trusted location
    to avoid potential security vulnerabilities from maliciously crafted input files.
    Also, importing large datasets may impact server performance during the loading
    process.
