  signature: bool TradeManager::CanTradeItem(Item * item) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specific item can be traded within the game's trading
    system.
  description: The CanTradeItem method evaluates whether a given item is eligible
    for trading between players in World of Warcraft. This check typically includes
    verifying that the item is not bound, is not a quest item, and meets other game
    rules that prevent certain items from being traded. The method is used internally
    by the trading system to validate trade proposals before allowing them to proceed.
    It ensures that players cannot trade items that would break game economy or gameplay
    balance.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item can be traded, false otherwise. This indicates
    whether the item meets all necessary conditions for inclusion in a trade window.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if an item is tradeable
    code: "Item* item = player->GetItemByPos(INVENTORY_SLOT_BAG_0, slot);\nif (tradeManager->CanTradeItem(item))\
      \ {\n    // Item can be added to trade\n    tradeWindow->AddItem(item);\n} else\
      \ {\n    // Item cannot be traded\n    SendTradeError(TRADE_ERROR_ITEM_NOT_TRADEABLE);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely performs several checks including item binding status,
    quest item flags, and item restrictions. It may also consider the item's quality
    level and whether it's soulbound or account-bound. The implementation is probably
    optimized to avoid expensive operations by checking simple flags first.
  warnings: Do not rely on this method alone for final trade validation; additional
    checks should be performed in the trading system. This method does not validate
    that the item is actually in the player's inventory or accessible.
