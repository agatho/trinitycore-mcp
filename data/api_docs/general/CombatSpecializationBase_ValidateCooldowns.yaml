  brief: Validates and updates the cooldown state of combat specializations for a
    player
  description: The ValidateCooldowns method ensures that all active combat specializations
    for a player are properly synchronized with their current cooldown timers. This
    method is typically invoked during combat state transitions or when specialization
    abilities are used to prevent invalid cooldown states. It checks each specialization's
    cooldown status and updates internal tracking mechanisms accordingly. The method
    operates on the player's current specialization set and ensures that no abilities
    are incorrectly marked as available when they should still be on cooldown.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Handler
    code: "void MyCombatHandler::OnPlayerAttack(Player* player)\n{\n    if (player->GetCombatSpecialization())\n\
      \    {\n        player->GetCombatSpecialization()->ValidateCooldowns();\n  \
      \  }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore combat system
    during state transitions. It may trigger additional cooldown updates or specialization
    state changes that affect gameplay mechanics. The validation process might involve
    checking against global server time and player-specific cooldown modifiers.
  warnings: Calling this method directly outside of appropriate combat contexts may
    lead to inconsistent specialization states. Ensure proper synchronization with
    the combat system to avoid race conditions or invalid cooldown states.
