  class: GuildBankManager
  method: AssessItemUtility
  signature: void GuildBankManager::AssessItemUtility(int * guild, uint32 itemId,
    float & utility)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and assigns a utility value to a specified item within the guild
    bank based on its relevance and value to the guild.
  description: The AssessItemUtility method evaluates the usefulness or importance
    of a specific item within the context of a guild's banking system. It takes an
    item identifier and computes a utility score that reflects how beneficial or necessary
    this item is for the guild's overall objectives, such as raid preparation, crafting
    needs, or general inventory management. This utility value can be used to prioritize
    item retrieval, determine item placement in the bank, or assist in automated guild
    resource allocation decisions. The method modifies the provided utility reference
    with a calculated floating-point value representing this assessment.
  parameters:
  - name: guild
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the guild identifier (GUID) associated
      with the item being assessed.
  - name: itemId
    description: Unique identifier of the item within the game's database that is
      to be evaluated for utility.
  - name: utility
    description: Reference to a float value that will be updated with the computed
      utility score for the specified item.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int guildId = 12345;

      uint32 itemId = 18765;

      float utilityScore;

      GuildBankManager bankManager;

      bankManager.AssessItemUtility(&guildId, itemId, utilityScore);

      // utilityScore now contains the calculated utility value for item 18765 in
      guild 12345'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank data structures and
    may consider factors such as item rarity, class relevance, and current guild needs
    when calculating the utility score. It is assumed to be part of a larger system
    that manages guild inventory optimization.
