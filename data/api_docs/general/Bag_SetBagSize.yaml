  class: Bag
  method: SetBagSize
  signature: void Bag::SetBagSize(int numSlots)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the number of slots available in the bag.
  description: The SetBagSize method configures the maximum number of slots that a
    Bag object can hold. This method is typically used during item initialization
    or when modifying the capacity of a container. The change affects how many items
    can be stored within the bag and influences inventory management logic. It's important
    to note that this method may trigger updates to the client-side UI to reflect
    the new slot count, and it should only be called when the bag is not actively
    being used by players or during safe initialization phases.
  parameters:
  - name: numSlots
    description: The desired number of slots for the bag. Must be a non-negative integer.
      Valid values typically range from 0 to the maximum supported slot count for
      the specific bag type (e.g., 16, 20, 32, etc.). Setting this value to zero effectively
      disables the bag's storage capacity.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'Bag* myBag = new Bag();

      myBag->SetBagSize(20);

      // The bag now has 20 slots available for items.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Slot Adjustment
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* bagItem = player->GetItemByGuid(bagGuid);\n\
      if (bagItem && bagItem->GetTemplate()->GetBagFamily() == BAG_FAMILY_CONTAINER)\n\
      {\n    Bag* bag = dynamic_cast<Bag*>(bagItem);\n    if (bag)\n    {\n      \
      \  bag->SetBagSize(32); // Increase bag size to 32 slots\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not validate the input parameter against existing items
    in the bag. If the new slot count is less than the current number of items, those
    excess items may be lost or moved to other containers depending on implementation
    details. The method should ideally be called before any items are added to ensure
    consistent behavior.
  warnings: Modifying a bag's size while it contains items can lead to undefined behavior
    or data loss. Always verify that the bag is empty or handle item migration appropriately
    before calling this method. Additionally, changing slot counts dynamically during
    gameplay may cause synchronization issues with the client if not handled carefully.
