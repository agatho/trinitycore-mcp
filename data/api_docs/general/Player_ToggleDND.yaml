  brief: Toggles the player's Do Not Disturb status, preventing others from interrupting
    their gameplay.
  description: The ToggleDND method switches the player's Do Not Disturb (DND) status
    on or off. When enabled, this setting prevents other players from interrupting
    the current player's gameplay by sending messages or requests. The method is typically
    used during activities like questing, crafting, or combat to maintain focus and
    avoid distractions. It does not affect the player's ability to receive messages
    or interact with NPCs, but rather blocks incoming communications from other players.

    between players during group activities or raids. It is recommended that players
