documentation:
  brief: Returns the guild GUID associated with the player in the who list entry
  description: The GetGuildGuid method retrieves the unique identifier (GUID) of the
    guild that the player belongs to, as stored in the WhoListPlayerInfo structure.
    This method is typically used in the context of the /who command implementation
    within TrinityCore's server functionality. The returned value represents the database
    ID of the guild and can be used to look up additional guild information. The method
    does not perform any validation on whether the player actually has a guild or
    if the guild still exists in the database.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the GUID of the player's guild. Returns 0 if the
    player is not in a guild or if the guild GUID is invalid.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to check if player is in a guild
    code: "WhoListPlayerInfo playerInfo;\n// ... populate playerInfo ...\nint guildGuid\
      \ = playerInfo.GetGuildGuid();\nif (guildGuid > 0)\n{\n    // Player belongs\
      \ to a guild\n    printf(\"Player is in guild with GUID: %d\\n\", guildGuid);\n\
      }\nelse\n{\n    // Player is not in a guild\n    printf(\"Player is not in a\
      \ guild\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method returns the raw database GUID value stored in the WhoListPlayerInfo
    structure. In TrinityCore, guild GUIDs are typically positive integers representing
    the primary key in the guild table. The method assumes that the data has been
    properly populated by the server's who list generation logic.
