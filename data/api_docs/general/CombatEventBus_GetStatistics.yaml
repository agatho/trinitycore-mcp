  class: CombatEventBus
  method: GetStatistics
  signature: const Statistics & CombatEventBus::GetStatistics() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the combat statistics tracked by the CombatEventBus instance.
  description: The GetStatistics method provides access to a read-only snapshot of
    combat-related performance metrics and event counts maintained by the CombatEventBus.
    This includes data such as total events processed, average processing time, and
    other diagnostic information that can be used for monitoring or debugging combat
    system behavior. The returned Statistics object is immutable, ensuring thread
    safety when accessed from multiple contexts.
  parameters: []
  returns: A constant reference to a Statistics structure containing cumulative combat
    event data including counts, timing metrics, and performance indicators.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing Combat Statistics
    code: 'const auto& stats = combatEventBus.GetStatistics();

      uint32 totalEvents = stats.totalEvents;

      uint64 avgProcessingTime = stats.averageProcessingTimeUs;'
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned Statistics object is guaranteed to be thread-safe and should
    not be modified. It represents a consistent snapshot at the time of the call,
    unaffected by subsequent events in the combat bus.
