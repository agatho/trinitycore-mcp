  class: IResourceSystem
  method: GetResourceTypeName
  signature: const char * IResourceSystem::GetResourceTypeName() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the human-readable name of the resource type managed by this system
    instance.
  description: The GetResourceTypeName method retrieves a constant character string
    that represents the descriptive name of the resource type handled by the IResourceSystem
    instance. This name is typically used for logging, debugging, or displaying user-facing
    information about what kind of resources this system manages. The returned string
    is guaranteed to be valid and null-terminated throughout the lifetime of the system
    instance. This method does not perform any operations that would alter the state
    of the resource system.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to a null-terminated character string containing the name of
    the resource type. The returned pointer is valid for the lifetime of the IResourceSystem
    instance and should not be modified or freed by the caller.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'IResourceSystem* resourceSystem = GetResourceSystemForType(ResourceType::ITEM);

      const char* typeName = resourceSystem->GetResourceTypeName();

      printf("Resource system handles: %s\n", typeName);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Logging Resource Type Information
    code: "void LogResourceTypeInfo(IResourceSystem* system) {\n    if (system !=\
      \ nullptr) {\n        const char* name = system->GetResourceTypeName();\n  \
      \      TC_LOG_INFO(\"server.loading\", \"Loading resource type: %s\", name);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The returned string is managed internally by the IResourceSystem implementation
    and should not be freed or modified. It's safe to call this method from any thread
    that has access to the IResourceSystem instance, assuming the system itself is
    thread-safe.
