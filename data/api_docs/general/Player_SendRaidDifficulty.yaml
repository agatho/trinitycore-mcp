documentation:
  brief: Sends raid difficulty information to the player, allowing them to view the
    current raid difficulty settings.
  description: This method sends the current raid difficulty information to the player,
    including whether they are in legacy mode and what forced difficulty is set. It
    is used primarily for updating players' UI elements related to raid difficulty
    selection. The method handles both legacy and non-legacy modes, with the latter
    being used for newer content where forced difficulties are applied. This functionality
    is essential for maintaining proper game state communication between server and
    client.
  parameters:
  - name: legacy
    description: Determines whether the player is in legacy mode or not. If true,
      the player will see legacy difficulty settings; if false, they will see non-legacy
      settings.
  - name: forcedDifficulty
    description: The forced difficulty level that should be applied to the player's
      raid instance. This value determines which difficulty level is shown in the
      UI, with -1 indicating no forced difficulty applied.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendRaidDifficulty(true, 1);

      // This sends the legacy raid difficulty information to the player'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SendRaidDifficulty(false, 2);

      // This sends non-legacy raid difficulty information with forced difficulty
      level 2'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called when a player enters a raid instance or when
    the raid difficulty changes. It ensures that players receive proper UI updates
    related to their current raid difficulty settings.
  warnings: Improper use of this method can lead to incorrect UI display for players,
    potentially causing confusion about which difficulty they're playing in. Always
    ensure correct parameters are passed based on game context.
