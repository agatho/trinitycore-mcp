  method: SetParentRotation
  signature: void GameObject::SetParentRotation(const QuaternionData & rotation)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the parent rotation for a game object, defining its orientation in 3D
    space.
  description: This method assigns a quaternion-based rotation to a GameObject, determining
    its orientation within the game world. The rotation parameter defines the object's
    transform in three-dimensional space using quaternions, which are commonly used
    in World of Warcraft for precise rotation handling. This method is typically used
    when setting up or modifying the orientation of game objects like doors, gates,
    or other interactive elements that require specific rotational alignment. The
    parent rotation affects how the object interacts with its environment and can
    influence collision detection and visual rendering.
  parameters:
  - name: rotation
    description: A QuaternionData object containing the rotation values defining the
      GameObject's orientation in 3D space. This parameter specifies the object's
      transform using quaternions, which represent rotations without gimbal problems.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Parent Rotation for a Door
    code: 'GameObject* door = new GameObject();

      QuaternionData rotation;

      rotation.w = 0.707f;

      rotation.x = 0.0f;

      rotation.y = 0.0f;

      rotation.z = 0.707f;

      door->SetParentRotation(rotation);'
    language: cpp
  notes: The method directly modifies the GameObject's rotation data, which may affect
    its physical properties and collision detection. This operation should be performed
    carefully during object initialization or when changing orientation dynamically.
  warnings: Improper use of quaternion rotations can lead to incorrect visual orientation
    or collision issues. Ensure that the quaternion values are properly normalized
    before applying them to avoid rotation artifacts.
