  class: AuraEffect
  method: HandleNoImmediateEffect
  signature: void AuraEffect::HandleNoImmediateEffect(const AuraApplication * param0,
    uint8 param1, bool param2) const
documentation:
  brief: Handles aura effects that do not have an immediate application or removal
    behavior.
  description: The HandleNoImmediateEffect method is a placeholder or default handler
    for aura effects that are designed to take effect at a later time, rather than
    immediately upon application or removal. This method typically does nothing or
    performs minimal operations when invoked, as the actual effect handling is deferred
    until a specific condition or tick occurs. It's commonly used in aura implementations
    where the effect logic is managed by other systems such as periodic tick handlers
    or delayed activation mechanisms. The method signature includes parameters for
    the aura application context, a byte parameter that may represent effect index
    or type, and a boolean flag indicating whether the effect should be applied or
    removed.
  parameters:
  - name: param0
    description: Pointer to the AuraApplication object representing the application
      context of this aura effect. This provides access to information about how the
      aura is applied to a target.
  - name: param1
    description: A uint8 parameter that likely represents the effect index or type
      within the aura. It may be used to distinguish between different effects in
      a multi-effect aura.
  - name: param2
    description: Boolean flag indicating whether the effect should be applied (true)
      or removed (false). This controls the direction of the operation.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in aura effect handler
    code: "void MyAuraEffect::HandleNoImmediateEffect(const AuraApplication* app,\
      \ uint8 effIndex, bool apply)\n{\n    // This method does nothing for immediate\
      \ effects\n    // Actual effect logic is handled elsewhere\n    return;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called as part of the aura application or removal
    process in TrinityCore. It's designed to be overridden by derived classes that
    implement specific delayed or conditional effects. The parameters are passed from
    the core aura system and should not be modified directly within this method.
  warnings: Do not assume this method will perform any meaningful action. It is intended
    as a default handler for effects that do not require immediate processing. Any
    effect logic must be implemented in other methods or callbacks.
