  method: IsChanged
  signature: bool Loot::IsChanged() const
documentation:
  brief: Indicates whether the loot has been modified since the last reset or initialization.
  description: The IsChanged method checks if any modifications have been made to
    the loot object since it was last initialized or reset. This is commonly used
    in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore to determine if loot data needs to be saved
    or updated in the database. The method typically returns true when items have
    been added, removed, or altered within the loot container, and false when the
    loot remains in its original state. This functionality supports efficient data
    synchronization and prevents unnecessary database writes.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the loot object has been modified since initialization
    or reset; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Checking Loot Modification Status
    code: "Loot* loot = player->GetLoot();\nif (loot->IsChanged()) {\n    // Loot\
      \ has been modified, save changes\n    loot->SaveToDB();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with loot persistence systems
    to optimize database I/O operations. The change tracking mechanism may be implemented
    using a dirty bit flag or similar pattern internally.
