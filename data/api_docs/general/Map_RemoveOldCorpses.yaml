documentation:
  brief: Removes old corpses from the map that have exceeded their decay time.
  description: The RemoveOldCorpses method cleans up corpse objects on the map by
    removing those that have been present longer than the configured corpse decay
    time. This method is typically called periodically by the game server to prevent
    the accumulation of stale corpse data in memory and on the map. Corpses are considered
    'old' when their creation time has surpassed the maximum allowed decay duration,
    which is defined by the server configuration. The cleanup process ensures that
    the map does not become cluttered with decomposed remains and maintains optimal
    performance.

  - title: Basic Usage in Map Update Loop
    code: "void WorldMap::Update()\n{\n    // ... other update logic ...\n    RemoveOldCorpses();\n\
      \    // ... rest of update logic ...\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is usually invoked automatically by the server's map update cycle.
    It operates on all corpses present in the map's corpse list and removes them based
    on their age. The decay time threshold is configurable via server settings, typically
    found under 'corpse.decay' or similar configuration options.
