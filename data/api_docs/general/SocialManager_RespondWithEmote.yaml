  class: SocialManager
  method: RespondWithEmote
  signature: bool SocialManager::RespondWithEmote(Player * trigger, EmoteType triggerEmote)
documentation:
  brief: Processes an emote response triggered by another player's emote.
  description: The RespondWithEmote method handles the logic for responding to a player-initiated
    emote. It evaluates whether the current player should react to the trigger emote,
    and if so, sends an appropriate emote back to the triggering player. This method
    is typically invoked as part of the social interaction system in TrinityCore,
    enabling players to engage in emote-based communication. The method checks for
    valid emote types and ensures proper social behavior rules are followed before
    executing the response.
  parameters:
  - name: trigger
    description: Pointer to the Player object that initiated the emote trigger. This
      player's emote will be responded to.
  - name: triggerEmote
    description: The EmoteType enum value representing the type of emote that triggered
      this response. Used to determine appropriate reaction behavior.
  returns: Returns true if the emote response was successfully processed and sent;
    false otherwise, such as when the conditions for responding are not met or an
    error occurs during execution.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Emote Response
    code: "if (socialManager->RespondWithEmote(player, EMOTE_STATE_SALUTE)) {\n  \
      \  // Successfully responded with salute emote\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional Emote Response Handling
    code: "Player* target = ...; // Get target player\nif (target && socialManager->RespondWithEmote(target,\
      \ EMOTE_STATE_DANCE)) {\n    // Player responded to dance emote with another\
      \ emote\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the core social interaction system and relies on proper
    player state validation. It may perform checks against friendship, faction, or
    other social restrictions before allowing a response. The method assumes valid
    input parameters and does not perform null-checks on the Player pointer.
  warnings: Calling this method without ensuring that the trigger player is valid
    can lead to undefined behavior. Ensure that both the trigger player and emote
    type are valid before invoking this method. Improper use may result in client-side
    issues or server-side crashes.
