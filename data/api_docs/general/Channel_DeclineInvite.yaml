  class: Channel
  method: DeclineInvite
  signature: void Channel::DeclineInvite(const Player * player)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a player from the channel's invite list, preventing them from joining
    the channel.
  description: The DeclineInvite method removes a specific player from the channel's
    invite list. When invoked, it ensures that the player will not be able to join
    the channel even if they were previously invited. This method is typically called
    when a player chooses not to accept an invitation to a channel, such as a guild
    or raid channel. The operation affects only the specific player and channel relationship,
    without altering other members or the channel's overall state. It is part of the
    channel management system in TrinityCore, which handles player invitations and
    membership.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: A pointer to the Player object whose invitation should be declined.
      Must not be null. The player must have been previously invited to this channel.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Decline an Invitation to a Channel
    code: "Channel* channel = sChannelMgr->GetChannel(\"GuildChat\", player->GetTeam());\n\
      if (channel)\n{\n    channel->DeclineInvite(player);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not send any notification to the player about the decline.
    It simply removes the player from the internal invite list. The method assumes
    that the player has already been invited to the channel, otherwise the operation
    may have no effect or could result in undefined behavior.
  warnings: Ensure that the player pointer is valid and not null before calling this
    method. Calling this on a player who was not invited to the channel may lead to
    unexpected behavior or errors. This method should only be called from within the
    context of a valid channel invitation flow.
