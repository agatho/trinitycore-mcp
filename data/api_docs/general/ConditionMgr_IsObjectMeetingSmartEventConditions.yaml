documentation:
  brief: Checks if an object meets the conditions required for a SmartEvent to trigger.
  description: The IsObjectMeetingSmartEventConditions method evaluates whether a
    given object satisfies all the condition requirements associated with a specific
    SmartEvent. This function is typically used within the context of AI behaviors
    and event triggers in World of Warcraft's TrinityCore emulation. It takes into
    account various parameters such as entry or GUID, event ID, source type, and contextual
    units to determine if the conditions are met. The method performs internal lookups
    in the condition system to validate these requirements before returning a boolean
    result indicating success or failure.
  parameters:
  - name: entryOrGuid
    description: The entry ID or GUID of the object being evaluated for SmartEvent
      conditions. This identifier is used to locate the specific object within the
      game world.
  - name: eventId
    description: The unique identifier of the SmartEvent for which condition checking
      is performed. Each event has its own set of conditions that must be satisfied.
  - name: sourceType
    description: The source type indicating how the event was triggered (e.g., from
      a creature, game object, or player). This affects how conditions are interpreted
      and validated.
  - name: unit
    description: A pointer to the Unit involved in the event context. Can be nullptr
      if not applicable to the current evaluation.
  - name: baseObject
    description: A pointer to the base WorldObject involved in the event. Used for
      contextual evaluation of conditions related to spatial or object-based requirements.
  returns: Returns true if all conditions defined for the specified SmartEvent are
    met by the given object; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI behavior
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->IsObjectMeetingSmartEventConditions(creature->GetEntry(),\
      \ 12345, SMART_EVENT_UPDATE_IC, player, creature)) {\n    // Trigger some action\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking conditions for a game object event
    code: "if (sConditionMgr->IsObjectMeetingSmartEventConditions(go->GetGUID(), 67890,\
      \ SMART_EVENT_GO_CASTS_SPELL, nullptr, go)) {\n    // Handle the event trigger\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies heavily on internal condition storage and lookup tables.
    It is commonly used during AI decision-making processes where events must be evaluated
    before execution. Performance can be impacted by complex conditions or large numbers
    of active SmartEvents.
  warnings: Ensure that all parameters are valid before calling this function, especially
    entryOrGuid and eventId which directly affect internal lookups. Passing invalid
    pointers for unit or baseObject may lead to undefined behavior.
