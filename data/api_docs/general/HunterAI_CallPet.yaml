  brief: Summons or recalls the hunter's pet to their side
  description: The CallPet method is responsible for managing the summoning and recall
    of a hunter's companion pet within the TrinityCore framework. This method typically
    handles the logic for bringing a pet back to the hunter's location when called,
    ensuring proper positioning, combat state management, and synchronization with
    the pet's AI behavior. It integrates with the game's pet system to maintain consistent
    pet behavior and player-pet relationship mechanics.

  - title: Basic Pet Call Usage
    code: "void MyHunterAI::HandlePetCall()\n{\n    CallPet();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI state machine and may trigger
    events related to pet positioning, combat readiness, and player-pet synchronization.
    The implementation should account for different pet states (summoned, dismissed,
    in combat) and ensure proper handling of pet recall mechanics.
