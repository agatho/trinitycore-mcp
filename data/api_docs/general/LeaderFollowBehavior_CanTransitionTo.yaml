  class: LeaderFollowBehavior
  method: CanTransitionTo
  signature: bool LeaderFollowBehavior::CanTransitionTo(FollowState newState) const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a follower can transition to a specified follow state.
  description: The CanTransitionTo method evaluates if a follower entity is allowed
    to transition from its current state to a new specified follow state. This method
    is typically used in AI behavior systems to enforce valid state transitions for
    followers, ensuring they do not enter invalid or unsupported states during gameplay.
    It checks internal conditions such as the follower's current status, the target
    state's validity, and any constraints imposed by the leader or environment.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the transition to the specified follow state is allowed;
    otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Check Transition Permission
    code: "if (follower->GetBehavior()->CanTransitionTo(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW)) {\n\
      \    // Proceed with transitioning to follow state\n    follower->SetFollowState(FOLLOW_STATE_FOLLOW);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the AI behavior system and should be called before
    attempting a state change. It may perform checks against internal flags or game
    rules that prevent certain transitions.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying the follower's eligibility may lead
    to unexpected behavior in the AI system. Ensure that all preconditions for transitioning
    are met before invoking this function.
