documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CommandScript instance and cleans up associated resources.
  description: The CommandScript destructor is responsible for properly cleaning up
    any resources allocated during the lifetime of a CommandScript object. In the
    context of TrinityCore's World of Warcraft server implementation, this typically
    involves releasing memory, unregistering commands from the command system, and
    ensuring no dangling references remain. The destructor is automatically invoked
    when a CommandScript instance goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. It ensures
    proper resource management and prevents memory leaks within the server's command
    handling subsystem.

  - title: Automatic destruction of CommandScript
    code: "void SomeFunction() {\n    CommandScript* script = new CommandScript();\n\
      \    // ... use the script ...\n    delete script; // Destructor called here\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor is implicitly called by the C++ runtime when objects go out
    of scope or are deleted. Developers should not manually invoke destructors unless
    implementing custom memory management patterns. In TrinityCore, CommandScript
    instances are typically managed by the server's module loading system.
