  method: EnforceWithdrawLimits
  signature: void GuildBankManager::EnforceWithdrawLimits(int * player, uint32 tabId,
    uint32 requestedAmount)
documentation:
  brief: Enforces guild bank withdrawal limits for a player based on tab and requested
    amount.
  description: The EnforceWithdrawLimits method ensures that a player's guild bank
    withdrawal request does not exceed configured limits for the specified tab. This
    method validates the requested amount against the player's allowed withdrawal
    limits, which may be governed by guild permissions, tab-specific restrictions,
    or server-configured rules. It modifies the player's withdrawal state and potentially
    prevents the transaction if limits are exceeded. The method operates within the
    context of the GuildBankManager class and is typically invoked during bank transaction
    processing.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the player's unique identifier
      (GUID) attempting the withdrawal.
  - name: tabId
    description: Identifier of the guild bank tab from which the item is being withdrawn.
      Must be a valid tab index within the guild bank.
  - name: requestedAmount
    description: The number of items the player wishes to withdraw from the specified
      tab. This value is validated against configured limits.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'int playerId = 12345;

      uint32 tabId = 0;

      uint32 requestedAmount = 10;

      GuildBankManager::EnforceWithdrawLimits(&playerId, tabId, requestedAmount);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild bank state tracking and
    may modify player session data. It is expected to be called before any actual
    withdrawal operation occurs.
