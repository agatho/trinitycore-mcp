  class: BotNpcLocationService
  method: TryFindLiveCreature
  signature: NpcLocationResult BotNpcLocationService::TryFindLiveCreature(Player *
    bot, uint32 creatureEntry, float maxRange)
documentation:
  brief: Attempts to locate a live creature by entry ID within a specified range for
    a bot player.
  description: The TryFindLiveCreature method searches for an active (alive) creature
    with the specified entry ID within the given maximum range from the bot player's
    current position. It returns a NpcLocationResult structure containing information
    about whether the creature was found, its location, and other relevant data. This
    method is typically used in AI logic to identify nearby NPCs or creatures that
    the bot can interact with or target. The search considers only creatures that
    are currently alive and within the specified range, making it useful for targeting
    and pathfinding behaviors.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is searching
      for the creature. Must not be null.
  - name: creatureEntry
    description: The unique entry ID of the creature type to search for. This corresponds
      to the creature_template.entry field in the database.
  - name: maxRange
    description: Maximum distance (in yards) within which to search for the creature.
      Must be a positive value.
  returns: Returns a NpcLocationResult structure that contains information about the
    found creature, including whether it was located, its position coordinates, and
    other metadata. If no valid creature is found within range, the result will indicate
    failure.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage to find a specific creature type
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Bot player instance\nuint32 entryId = 12345; // Example\
      \ creature entry ID\nfloat range = 50.0f; // Search within 50 yards\nNpcLocationResult\
      \ result = BotNpcLocationService::TryFindLiveCreature(bot, entryId, range);\n\
      if (result.found)\n{\n    // Creature found, use result.location\n    sLog->outString(\"\
      Found creature at: %f, %f, %f\", result.location.x, result.location.y, result.location.z);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method performs a server-side search for creatures and relies on the
    WorldObject visibility system. It may not find creatures that are out of line-of-sight
    or in areas where visibility is restricted. The search is optimized to avoid unnecessary
    database queries by using cached data when possible.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot player pointer is valid before calling this method,
    as passing a null pointer will likely cause undefined behavior. Also, be aware
    that the maxRange parameter affects performance, so large ranges should be used
    judiciously in high-frequency AI logic.
