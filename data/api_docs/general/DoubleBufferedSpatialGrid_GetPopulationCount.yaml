  method: GetPopulationCount
  signature: uint32 DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid::GetPopulationCount() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the total number of objects currently stored in the spatial grid's
    active buffer.
  description: The GetPopulationCount method retrieves the count of all valid objects
    currently residing within the active spatial grid buffer. This method is typically
    used for monitoring grid occupancy, performance tuning, or debugging spatial partitioning
    systems. The returned value represents the total number of entities (such as players,
    creatures, or game objects) that have been added to the grid and are not yet removed.
    It does not include objects in the inactive buffer or those marked for removal.
    This count is essential for maintaining optimal server performance by ensuring
    grids do not become overly populated.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the total number of valid objects currently
    stored in the active spatial grid buffer. Returns zero if no objects are present.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage to Monitor Grid Population
    code: "uint32 population = grid->GetPopulationCount();\nif (population > MAX_GRID_OBJECTS)\n\
      {\n    // Log warning or take corrective action\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL,\
      \ \"Grid population exceeded threshold: %u\", population);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Population Count for Performance Logging
    code: "void LogGridStats(DoubleBufferedSpatialGrid* grid)\n{\n    uint32 count\
      \ = grid->GetPopulationCount();\n    sLog->outInfo(LOG_FILTER_GENERAL, \"Active\
      \ Grid Population: %u objects\", count);\n    // Additional logging or metrics\
      \ collection\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method operates on the active buffer of the double-buffered spatial
    grid system. It's important to note that this count reflects only those objects
    currently in the active buffer and may not include transient states during buffer
    swaps. The method is generally fast but should be used judiciously in performance-critical
    code paths.
  warnings: Do not rely on this value for real-time object management decisions, as
    it does not account for pending removals or asynchronous buffer updates. In high-frequency
    scenarios, consider caching the result to avoid repeated calls that may impact
    performance.
