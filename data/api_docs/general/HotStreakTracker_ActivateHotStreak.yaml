  method: ActivateHotStreak

documentation:
  brief: Activates the hot streak effect for the associated spell or ability.
  description: The ActivateHotStreak method enables the hot streak buff, which typically
    increases the critical strike chance or damage of subsequent spells cast by the
    player. This method is commonly used in conjunction with certain mage abilities
    such as Fireball or Frostbolt to enhance their effectiveness. The activation usually
    resets a cooldown timer and applies visual effects to indicate that the hot streak
    state is active. It may also trigger additional gameplay mechanics such as increased
    spell damage or altered casting behavior.

  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'HotStreakTracker* tracker = player->GetHotStreakTracker();

      tracker->ActivateHotStreak();'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should only be called when the conditions for activating a hot
    streak are met, such as after successfully landing a critical strike with a qualifying
    spell. The effect is usually temporary and may have a limited duration or number
    of uses before resetting.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying preconditions can lead to unexpected
    behavior or game state inconsistencies. Ensure that the player has the appropriate
    spell or ability available before invoking this function.
