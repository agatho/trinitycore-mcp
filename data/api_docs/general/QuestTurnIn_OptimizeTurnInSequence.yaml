  class: QuestTurnIn
  method: OptimizeTurnInSequence
  signature: void QuestTurnIn::OptimizeTurnInSequence(Player * bot, int & turnIns)
documentation:
  brief: Optimizes the sequence of quest turn-ins for a bot player to maximize efficiency.
  description: The OptimizeTurnInSequence method reorders and prioritizes quest turn-ins
    for a given bot player to minimize travel time and resource usage. This method
    is typically used in automated questing systems or AI bots within TrinityCore
    to ensure that quests are turned in in an optimal order based on proximity, quest
    requirements, and available rewards. It modifies the internal turn-in sequence
    stored in the provided player reference. The optimization considers factors such
    as quest dependencies, item availability, and NPC locations to reduce unnecessary
    travel.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that will perform
      the quest turn-ins. Must not be null.
  - name: turnIns
    description: Reference to an integer that holds the current count or state of
      turn-ins. This value is modified by the method to reflect optimized turn-in
      sequence.
  returns: None. The method performs in-place modification of the turn-in sequence
    and does not return any value.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of OptimizeTurnInSequence
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume initialized bot

      int turnIns = 5;

      QuestTurnIn::OptimizeTurnInSequence(bot, turnIns);

      // turnIns now reflects the optimized sequence count'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily intended for use in AI-driven questing systems or
    bots. It assumes that the player's quest data and inventory state are up-to-date
    before calling. Performance may vary depending on the number of active quests
    and their complexity.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'bot' parameter points to a valid Player object; passing
    a null pointer will result in undefined behavior. The method modifies the turnIns
    reference directly, so callers should be aware of this side effect.
