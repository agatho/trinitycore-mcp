  class: DemonologyWarlockRefactored
  method: DemonologyWarlockRefactored
  signature: void DemonologyWarlockRefactored::DemonologyWarlockRefactored(Player
    * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a Demonology Warlock AI bot with the specified player context.
  description: The DemonologyWarlockRefactored constructor initializes a new instance
    of the DemonologyWarlockRefactored AI class, setting up the bot's behavior and
    configuration based on the provided Player object. This method is responsible
    for establishing the core framework that governs how the warlock AI will interact
    with the game world, including spell selection, target prioritization, and combat
    decision-making. The initialization process typically involves setting up internal
    state variables, configuring AI behavior parameters, and preparing the bot to
    execute demonology-specific strategies such as managing summoned demons, optimizing
    spell rotations, and handling pet management within the context of a TrinityCore-based
    World of Warcraft server environment.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the Demonology Warlock
      AI bot. This parameter must be a valid, non-null pointer to an initialized Player
      instance that has been configured as a warlock class with demonology specialization.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Demonology Warlock Initialization
    code: 'Player* warlockBot = new Player();

      // ... configure player as demonology warlock ...

      DemonologyWarlockRefactored demonologyAI(warlockBot);

      // The AI is now initialized and ready for gameplay'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor is typically called during the creation or loading phase
    of an AI bot. It assumes that the Player object passed in has already been properly
    configured with appropriate class, specialization, and level settings. The implementation
    may perform additional setup steps such as initializing spell caches, setting
    up target tracking systems, and preparing pet management logic.
  warnings: Passing a null or improperly initialized Player pointer to this constructor
    will likely result in undefined behavior or runtime errors. Ensure that the Player
    object is fully constructed and valid before passing it to this constructor.
