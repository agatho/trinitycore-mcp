documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a player should accept a guild invitation based on social
    settings and restrictions.
  description: The ShouldAcceptGuildInvite method evaluates if a player is allowed
    to accept a guild invitation from another player. This check considers various
    social restrictions such as friendship status, ignore lists, and guild-specific
    rules. The method returns true if the invitation should be accepted, false otherwise.
    It's typically called when processing guild invite requests to ensure proper social
    behavior and prevent unwanted interactions between players.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the player should accept the guild invite, false if the
    invite should be rejected based on social restrictions or settings.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Guild Invite Handler
    code: "void HandleGuildInvite(Player* inviter, Player* invited)\n{\n    if (sSocialMgr->ShouldAcceptGuildInvite(inviter))\n\
      \    {\n        // Proceed with guild invitation logic\n        invited->GetSession()->SendGuildInvite(inviter);\n\
      \    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Send rejection message\n        invited->GetSession()->SendNotification(\"\
      You cannot accept this guild invite.\");\n    }\n}"

  notes: This method likely checks player relationship status, ignore lists, and server-side
    guild restrictions. It's part of the social system that manages player interactions
    in World of Warcraft. The implementation may vary based on TrinityCore configuration
    settings.
  warnings: Do not call this method directly without proper context validation. Ensure
    that both players are properly initialized before calling this function to avoid
    potential null pointer dereferences.
