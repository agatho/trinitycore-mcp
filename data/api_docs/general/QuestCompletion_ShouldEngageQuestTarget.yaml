  class: QuestCompletion
  method: ShouldEngageQuestTarget
  signature: bool QuestCompletion::ShouldEngageQuestTarget(Player * bot, Unit * target,
    const QuestObjectiveData & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a bot should engage a quest target based on quest objective
    data and player context.
  description: The ShouldEngageQuestTarget method evaluates if a bot player should
    initiate combat or interaction with a specified unit target in the context of
    a given quest objective. This method is typically used within AI logic to determine
    appropriate engagement behavior for quest-related activities such as killing monsters,
    interacting with NPCs, or collecting items. It considers factors like the target's
    type, faction, and the current state of the bot's quest progress. The method returns
    true if engagement is deemed appropriate according to quest rules and bot behavior
    settings, otherwise false.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that may engage
      the target. Must be a valid player instance with active quest data.
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to the Unit object representing the potential target to engage.
      Can be an NPC, creature, or game object depending on quest requirements.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing details about
      the current quest objective being evaluated for engagement.
  returns: Boolean value indicating whether the bot should engage the target. Returns
    true if engagement is appropriate based on quest rules and context; false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (questCompletion.ShouldEngageQuestTarget(bot, target, objective)) {\n\
      \    bot->Attack(target);\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with quest state checking
    code: "bool shouldEngage = questCompletion.ShouldEngageQuestTarget(playerBot,\
      \ npcTarget, questObjective);\nif (shouldEngage && playerBot->CanAttack(npcTarget))\
      \ {\n    playerBot->SetFacingToObject(npcTarget);\n    playerBot->Attack(npcTarget);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the quest completion AI system and should be called
    before any engagement actions. The method assumes that the provided parameters
    are valid and not null. It may internally check for quest completion status, target
    validity, and faction relationships.
  warnings: Ensure that the bot and target pointers are valid before calling this
    method to prevent crashes. This method does not perform its own validation of
    the input parameters.
