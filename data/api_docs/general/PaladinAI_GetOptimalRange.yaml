  class: PaladinAI
  method: GetOptimalRange
  signature: float PaladinAI::GetOptimalRange(int * target)
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the optimal attack range for a paladin AI unit based
    on current target and spell availability.
  description: The GetOptimalRange method determines the ideal distance at which a
    paladin AI should engage its target. This calculation takes into account the paladin's
    current target, available spells, and combat mechanics to ensure optimal positioning
    for spell casting and melee attacks. The method considers factors such as the
    range of offensive abilities like Judgement or Holy Shock, as well as the need
    to maintain proper distance for defensive spells like Blessing of Sanctuary. It
    dynamically adjusts based on the AI's current state and target type to maximize
    effectiveness in combat situations.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a float value representing the optimal engagement range in yards.
    This value indicates the distance at which the paladin should position itself
    for maximum combat efficiency, accounting for spell ranges and melee capabilities.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage in Combat Logic
    code: "float optimalRange = ai->GetOptimalRange();\nif (me->GetDistance(target)\
      \ > optimalRange)\n{\n    // Move closer to target\n    me->GetMotionMaster()->MoveChase(target);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using Optimal Range for Spell Casting Decision
    code: "float range = ai->GetOptimalRange();\nif (me->GetDistance(target) <= range)\n\
      {\n    // Cast offensive spell if in range\n    if (me->HasSpell(19750)) //\
      \ Holy Shock\n        me->CastSpell(target, 19750, true);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is primarily used within the paladin AI's decision-making process
    and should be called regularly during combat updates. The returned value may vary
    based on the paladin's current spell selection and target type. The implementation
    considers both melee and ranged spell capabilities to determine optimal positioning.
  warnings: The method assumes that the AI has a valid target set before calling.
    If no target exists, the behavior is undefined and may result in incorrect range
    calculations or potential crashes. Always verify target existence before invoking
    this method.
