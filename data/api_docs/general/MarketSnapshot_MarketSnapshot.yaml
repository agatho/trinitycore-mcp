documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new MarketSnapshot instance with default values.
  description: The MarketSnapshot constructor initializes a new market snapshot object,
    setting up internal data structures to represent the current state of the auction
    house market. This method prepares the object for capturing and storing market
    data such as item prices, quantities, and trends. The initialization ensures that
    all member variables are properly configured with default values before any market
    data is collected or processed.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Creating a new MarketSnapshot instance
    code: 'MarketSnapshot snapshot;

      // The snapshot object is now initialized and ready to capture market data'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any expensive operations or network calls.
    It simply initializes internal member variables to their default states. The actual
    market data collection and processing occurs through other methods in the class.
