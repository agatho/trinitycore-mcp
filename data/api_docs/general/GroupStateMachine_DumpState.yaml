  brief: Dumps the current state of the group state machine to the log for debugging
    purposes.
  description: The DumpState method outputs the internal state information of the
    GroupStateMachine object to the system log. This utility function is primarily
    used for debugging and development to inspect the current state transitions, member
    statuses, and overall group management state within TrinityCore's group handling
    system. The method does not modify any state but provides a snapshot of the current
    internal conditions of the group state machine.

  notes: This method is typically only active in debug builds of TrinityCore and may
    not produce output in release builds. It should be used primarily during development
    or when troubleshooting group-related issues.
