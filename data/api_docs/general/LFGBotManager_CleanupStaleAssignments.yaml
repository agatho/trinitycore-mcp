  brief: Removes expired or invalid LFG bot assignments from the system
  description: The CleanupStaleAssignments method is responsible for identifying and
    removing outdated or invalid LFG (Looking For Group) bot assignments that have
    either expired due to time constraints or are no longer valid due to player disconnections,
    group changes, or other game state modifications. This method ensures that the
    LFG bot system maintains clean data by periodically purging stale entries that
    could otherwise cause conflicts or resource waste. The cleanup process typically
    involves checking assignment timestamps, verifying player online status, and confirming
    group validity before removing obsolete entries from internal tracking structures.

  notes: This method is typically called periodically by the system scheduler or during
    server maintenance routines. It may involve database operations and should be
    optimized for performance to avoid blocking main game threads. The cleanup process
    might be triggered automatically based on system load or time intervals.
