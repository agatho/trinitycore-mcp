  signature: void AfflictionWarlockRefactored::EnsurePetActive()
documentation:
  brief: Ensures that the warlock's pet is active and ready for combat.
  description: The EnsurePetActive method checks whether the Affliction Warlock's
    summoned pet is currently active and in a usable state. If the pet is not active
    or has been dismissed, this method will attempt to summon or reactivate it. This
    ensures that the warlock maintains a functional pet during combat scenarios, which
    is crucial for maintaining damage output and control abilities. The method typically
    handles pet state validation and reactivation logic without requiring explicit
    user input.

    code: "void MyWarlockAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // Ensure pet is active\
      \ before casting spells\n    m_warlock->EnsurePetActive();\n    // Proceed with\
      \ spell casting logic\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with the pet's AI state machine and may trigger
    automatic summoning if the pet was dismissed or killed. It is typically called
    during AI update cycles to maintain consistent pet availability.
