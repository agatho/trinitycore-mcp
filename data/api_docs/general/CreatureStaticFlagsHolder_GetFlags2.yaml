  method: GetFlags2
  signature: int CreatureStaticFlagsHolder::GetFlags2() const
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the second set of static flags associated with a creature.
  description: The GetFlags2 method returns the secondary set of static flags that
    define specific behavioral or functional properties of a creature in the TrinityCore
    framework. These flags are typically used to control various aspects of creature
    AI, interaction, and game mechanics such as whether the creature can be targeted,
    if it has special movement patterns, or if it should ignore certain combat conditions.
    The returned integer value is a bitmask where each bit represents a specific flag.
    This method is commonly used during creature initialization and runtime to determine
    creature behavior without modifying core game logic directly.
  parameters: []
  returns: An integer representing the second set of static flags as a bitmask. Each
    bit in the returned value corresponds to a specific property or behavior flag
    defined by the game's internal flag system for creatures.
  examples:
  - title: Checking if a creature has a specific flag
    code: "Creature* creature = ...; // Assume creature is initialized\nint flags2\
      \ = creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->GetFlags2();\nif (flags2 & CREATURE_FLAG2_NO_PVP)\n\
      {\n    // Creature does not participate in PvP\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Using flags to determine creature behavior
    code: "CreatureStaticFlagsHolder* flagsHolder = ...; // Assume initialized\nint\
      \ flags2 = flagsHolder->GetFlags2();\nif (flags2 & CREATURE_FLAG2_CAN_BE_LEASHED)\n\
      {\n    // This creature can be leashed by players\n}\nelse\n{\n    // This creature\
      \ cannot be leashed\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The flags returned by this method are part of a larger system of creature
    static data that is loaded from the database at server startup. The exact meaning
    of each bit in the returned integer depends on the game's internal flag definitions,
    which may vary between different TrinityCore versions or custom configurations.
  warnings: This method returns a raw bitmask value; developers must ensure they properly
    mask and check individual bits using bitwise operations. Incorrect handling of
    the bitmask can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in creature AI logic.
