documentation:
  brief: Skins a creature to remove its visual model and make it appear as if it has
    been harvested or gathered.
  description: The SkinCreature method is used in TrinityCore's gathering system to
    process a creature by removing its visual appearance, effectively making it 'skin'
    or 'gather' the creature. This typically occurs when a player interacts with a
    gatherable creature such as herbs, ore veins, or other resources. The method handles
    the removal of the creature's model and may trigger related events or updates
    in the game world. It is part of the core gathering mechanics that allow players
    to collect resources from creatures. The method returns true if the skinning process
    was successful, and false otherwise, which could happen if the creature is not
    a valid gatherable type or if the operation fails for any reason.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the creature was successfully skinned (i.e., its visual
    model was removed and it was marked as gathered), false if the operation failed
    or the creature could not be processed.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of SkinCreature
    code: "if (GatheringManager::SkinCreature(creature)) {\n    // Creature has been\
      \ successfully skinned\n    // Update player's gathering progress or award loot\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the game engine when a player
    interacts with a gatherable creature. It may also be used in custom scripts or
    mods to simulate gathering behavior. Developers should ensure that the creature
    passed to this method is valid and of a type that supports skinning.
  warnings: Calling this method on a creature that does not support skinning can result
    in undefined behavior or errors. Always verify that the creature is a valid gatherable
    resource before calling SkinCreature.
