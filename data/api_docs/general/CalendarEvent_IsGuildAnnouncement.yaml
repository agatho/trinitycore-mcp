  class: CalendarEvent
  method: IsGuildAnnouncement
  signature: bool CalendarEvent::IsGuildAnnouncement(uint32 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a calendar event is a guild announcement based on its
    flags.
  description: The IsGuildAnnouncement method checks if a calendar event is classified
    as a guild announcement by evaluating the provided flags. In World of Warcraft's
    TrinityCore implementation, calendar events can have various flag types that define
    their behavior and visibility. Guild announcements are a specific type of event
    that typically appears in guild-related contexts and may have special permissions
    or display characteristics. This method is used internally by the game server
    to determine how to process and display calendar events according to their type.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The flags associated with the calendar event that determine its type
      and behavior. These flags are typically defined as bitfield values that represent
      different properties of the event such as whether it's a guild event, an instance,
      or an announcement.
  returns: Returns true if the event is a guild announcement (i.e., the appropriate
    flag is set), false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Check if an event is a guild announcement
    code: "uint32 eventFlags = 0x00000010; // Example flags value\nbool isAnnouncement\
      \ = CalendarEvent::IsGuildAnnouncement(eventFlags);\nif (isAnnouncement)\n{\n\
      \    // Handle guild announcement logic\n    printf(\"This is a guild announcement\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The method assumes that the flags parameter contains valid calendar event
    flag values. The exact bit positions and meanings of these flags are defined within
    the TrinityCore calendar system implementation. This method is typically used
    in conjunction with other calendar event processing logic to properly categorize
    and handle different types of events.
  warnings: This method should only be called with valid calendar event flags. Passing
    invalid or uninitialized flag values may lead to incorrect behavior. The method
    does not validate that the flags represent a legitimate calendar event type, so
    callers should ensure proper initialization of event data before calling this
    method.
