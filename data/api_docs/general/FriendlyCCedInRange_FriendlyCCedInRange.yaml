  class: FriendlyCCedInRange
  method: FriendlyCCedInRange
  signature: void FriendlyCCedInRange::FriendlyCCedInRange(const int * obj, float
    range)
documentation:
  brief: Checks if any friendly units are within the specified range that are currently
    under crowd control effects.
  description: The FriendlyCCedInRange method evaluates the area around a given object
    to determine whether any friendly units (such as players or pets) are located
    within a defined radius and are currently affected by a crowd control effect.
    This functionality is commonly used in AI scripts to make decisions based on the
    presence of controlled allies nearby. The method does not return a value but likely
    triggers internal logic or updates state variables related to unit positioning
    and status. It operates under the assumption that the input object has a valid
    position and that the range parameter defines a spherical area around this point.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: A pointer to an integer representing the identifier of the object
      from which the range check originates. This typically corresponds to a unit's
      GUID or similar unique identifier used in TrinityCore's internal systems.
  - name: range
    description: A floating-point value defining the maximum distance (in yards) within
      which friendly units under crowd control will be detected. Must be a positive
      number; negative values may lead to undefined behavior.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI script
    code: "void MyAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    if (me->IsInCombat())\n    {\n\
      \        // Check for friendly units within 10 yards under CC\n        FriendlyCCedInRange::FriendlyCCedInRange(&me->GetGUID(),\
      \ 10.0f);\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger AI framework and may interact with
    internal state tracking systems to determine unit status. It assumes that the
    object pointed to by 'obj' has valid positioning data and that the range value
    is within acceptable bounds for performance reasons.
  warnings: Using invalid or null pointers for 'obj' can lead to crashes or undefined
    behavior. Ensure that the range parameter is positive and reasonable to avoid
    excessive processing overhead.
