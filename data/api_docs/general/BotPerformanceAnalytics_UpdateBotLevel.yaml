  class: BotPerformanceAnalytics
  method: UpdateBotLevel
  signature: void BotPerformanceAnalytics::UpdateBotLevel(uint32_t botGuid, uint8_t
    newLevel)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the level of a specified bot in the performance analytics system.
  description: The UpdateBotLevel method is responsible for updating the recorded
    level of a specific bot within the BotPerformanceAnalytics framework. This method
    takes the unique identifier (GUID) of the bot and its new level as inputs, and
    updates the internal tracking mechanism to reflect this change. It is typically
    used when a bot's level changes during gameplay, such as through leveling up or
    being reset to a different level. The method does not return any value and operates
    directly on the analytics data structure without external side effects.
  parameters:
  - name: botGuid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the bot whose level is being updated.
      This value must correspond to an existing bot within the system.
  - name: newLevel
    description: The new level that the bot should be updated to. Valid values are
      typically between 1 and 80 for standard WoW characters, though this may vary
      based on server configuration.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotPerformanceAnalytics analytics;

      analytics.UpdateBotLevel(123456, 60);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Level During Gameplay
    code: 'uint32_t botGuid = player->GetGUID().GetCounter();

      uint8_t newLevel = player->getLevel();

      analytics.UpdateBotLevel(botGuid, newLevel);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the bot with the provided GUID already exists in
    the analytics system. If a non-existent GUID is passed, behavior may be undefined
    or result in an error depending on internal validation logic. The update operation
    is expected to be thread-safe if used in a multi-threaded environment.
  warnings: Passing an invalid botGuid (e.g., zero or a value not associated with
    any active bot) could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior. Ensure that
    the newLevel parameter is within acceptable bounds for the game's level system.
