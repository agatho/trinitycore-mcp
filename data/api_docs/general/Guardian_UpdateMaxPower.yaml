  class: Guardian
  method: UpdateMaxPower
  signature: void Guardian::UpdateMaxPower(int power)
documentation:
  brief: Updates the maximum power value for a guardian unit.
  description: The UpdateMaxPower method adjusts the maximum power (such as mana,
    rage, or energy) that a guardian unit can possess. This method is typically invoked
    when a guardian's power attributes change due to level-ups, equipment modifications,
    or other game mechanics. It ensures that the guardian's power statistics are correctly
    updated within the game state and that any dependent systems, such as power regeneration
    or spell casting, reflect the new maximum value. The method does not directly
    modify the current power amount but only recalculates and sets the upper limit
    for the power bar.
  parameters:
  - name: power
    description: The new maximum power value to assign to the guardian. This value
      must be a non-negative integer representing the updated maximum power points
      (e.g., mana, rage, energy).
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting Maximum Power for a Guardian
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...; // Assume a valid guardian pointer

      int newMaxPower = 1000;

      guardian->UpdateMaxPower(newMaxPower);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Updating Power Based on Level Progression
    code: 'Guardian* guardian = ...;

      int currentLevel = guardian->getLevel();

      int newMaxPower = 500 + (currentLevel * 20);

      guardian->UpdateMaxPower(newMaxPower);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method should be called after any change that affects the guardian's
    power capacity, such as gaining levels or changing gear. It may trigger internal
    recalculations of power regeneration rates and spell cost adjustments depending
    on the specific implementation in TrinityCore.
  warnings: Ensure that the 'power' parameter is a valid non-negative integer; passing
    negative values may lead to undefined behavior or incorrect power calculations
    within the game engine.
