  class: EconomyManager
  method: GetCraftingProfit
  signature: uint32 EconomyManager::GetCraftingProfit(uint32 recipeId) const
documentation:
  brief: Calculates and returns the profit margin for a specified crafting recipe
    in copper coins.
  description: The GetCraftingProfit method computes the net profit a player can expect
    to make from crafting an item using a specific recipe. It takes into account the
    cost of materials required for crafting, the potential selling price of the crafted
    item, and any associated crafting costs such as reagents or tool usage. This value
    is returned in copper coins, which is the base unit of currency in World of Warcraft.
    The method is typically used by the economy system to provide players with information
    about the profitability of crafting recipes. It assumes that all necessary prerequisites
    for the recipe are met and that the player has access to the required materials.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a uint32 value representing the net profit in copper coins. A return
    value of zero indicates either no profit or an error in calculation, such as missing
    data about material costs or item prices.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 profit = economyMgr->GetCraftingProfit(12345);\nif (profit > 0)\n\
      {\n    printf(\"Profit from recipe ID 12345: %u copper\\n\", profit);\n}\nelse\n\
      {\n    printf(\"No profit or error calculating profit for recipe ID 12345\\\
      n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EconomyManager class which handles various economic
    calculations within TrinityCore. The implementation likely involves looking up
    recipe data, material costs, and market values from internal databases or caches.
    It may be called frequently during crafting simulations or player interactions,
    so performance optimization is important.
  warnings: Ensure that the recipeId passed to this method corresponds to a valid
    crafting recipe in the database. Invalid recipe IDs might lead to incorrect calculations
    or undefined behavior. Also, note that profit values can vary based on current
    market conditions and may not reflect real-time pricing if caching is used.
