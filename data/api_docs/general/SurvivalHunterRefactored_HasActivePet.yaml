documentation:
  brief: Checks whether the hunter has an active pet in the game world
  description: This method determines if the SurvivalHunterRefactored instance currently
    controls an active pet. It evaluates the state of the hunter's pet, including
    whether it is summoned, alive, and under the hunter's control. The check typically
    involves verifying the pet's existence, its active status, and that it has not
    been dismissed or died. This method is commonly used in AI decision-making logic
    to determine if pet-related actions can be performed.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the hunter has an active pet that is currently summoned
    and alive; returns false otherwise.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI logic
    code: "if (hunter.HasActivePet()) {\n    // Perform pet-related actions\n    hunter.AttackTarget();\n\
      } else {\n    // Switch to player-only combat\n    hunter.CastSpell(SpellId::Hunter_Shot);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  - title: Conditional pet behavior
    code: "if (hunter.HasActivePet() && hunter.GetPet()->GetHealth() < 50) {\n   \
      \ // Pet is active but low on health\n    hunter.CastSpell(SpellId::Pet_Heal);\n\
      } else if (!hunter.HasActivePet()) {\n    // Summon pet if not present\n   \
      \ hunter.SummonPet(PetType::Wolf);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not check for the pet's specific type or level, only its
    active status. It may return false even if a pet was recently summoned but has
    not yet fully appeared in the game world.
  warnings: The method assumes that pet state changes are properly synchronized with
    the game world. In rare cases involving rapid pet dismissal and re-summoning,
    this check might return an outdated result.
