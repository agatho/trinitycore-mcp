documentation:
  brief: Checks if the ObjectGuid represents an area trigger entity.
  description: The IsAreaTrigger method determines whether the given ObjectGuid refers
    to an area trigger object within the TrinityCore world. Area triggers are special
    game objects that activate when players enter their defined spatial boundaries,
    often used for quest events, teleportation, or environmental effects. This method
    examines the type bits of the GUID to identify if it belongs to the area trigger
    category. The check is performed efficiently using bitwise operations on the GUID's
    internal representation.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the ObjectGuid represents an area trigger; otherwise returns
    false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ObjectGuid guid = ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::AreaTrigger>(12345);\nif\
      \ (guid.IsAreaTrigger()) {\n    // Handle area trigger logic\n    printf(\"\
      This GUID is an area trigger\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Checking Multiple GUIDs
    code: "std::vector<ObjectGuid> guids = { \n    ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Player>(1),\n\
      \    ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::AreaTrigger>(500),\n    ObjectGuid::Create<HighGuid::Creature>(1000)\n\
      };\n\nfor (const auto& guid : guids) {\n    if (guid.IsAreaTrigger()) {\n  \
      \      printf(\"Found area trigger with ID: %u\\n\", guid.GetLowPart());\n \
      \   }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the high GUID type bits being correctly set for area
    triggers. It's important to ensure that GUIDs are properly constructed using the
    appropriate Create<HighGuid::AreaTrigger>() template before calling this method.
    The implementation uses fast bitwise operations and should not introduce performance
    bottlenecks.
  warnings: This method only checks the type portion of the GUID and does not validate
    whether the actual object exists in the world or is properly initialized. Always
    verify that the GUID refers to a valid object before performing operations on
    it.
