documentation:
  brief: Manages holy power allocation and usage for the paladin AI.
  description: The ManageHolyPower method is responsible for handling the intelligent
    allocation and utilization of holy power within the PaladinAI class. This method
    evaluates the current state of the paladin's holy power resources, considering
    factors such as available mana, target health, spell cooldowns, and combat situation.
    It determines when to spend holy power on abilities like Holy Shock, Light of
    Dawn, or other holy-based spells to maximize damage output or healing effectiveness.
    The method ensures optimal resource management according to the paladin's current
    role (damage dealer or healer) and the tactical needs of the encounter.
  parameters:
  - name: target
    description: Pointer to an integer representing the target index or identifier
      for which holy power should be managed. This parameter is used to determine
      appropriate spell targeting and resource allocation based on the target's current
      health status and threat level.
  returns: null
  examples:

    code: "void PaladinAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff)\n{\n    // ... other AI logic ...\n\
      \    int targetIndex = GetTarget()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n    ManageHolyPower(&targetIndex);\n\
      \    // ... rest of AI logic ...\n}"

    code: "void PaladinAI::DoAction(int32 action)\n{\n    switch (action)\n    {\n\
      \        case ACTION_USE_HOLY_POWER:\n            int target = GetTarget()->GetGUID().GetRawValue();\n\
      \            ManageHolyPower(&target);\n            break;\n        default:\n\
      \            break;\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called during the AI update cycle and integrates
    with other paladin-specific mechanics such as spell cooldown tracking, target
    selection logic, and resource state management. Developers should ensure that
    the target parameter points to a valid target before calling this method to avoid
    undefined behavior.
  warnings: Improper handling of the target parameter can lead to incorrect holy power
    usage or invalid targeting. This method assumes proper initialization of paladin
    AI components and should not be called when the paladin is in an invalid state
    (e.g., dead, stunned).
