  class: Player
  method: SetCreateCurrency
  signature: void Player::SetCreateCurrency(uint32 id, uint32 amount)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the initial currency amount for a player upon creation.
  description: The SetCreateCurrency method configures the starting currency values
    that will be assigned to a player character when they are created. This method
    is typically used during player creation or character customization processes
    to define default currency holdings. The method operates on the player's internal
    currency storage and affects the initial state of the player's inventory in terms
    of currency items. It does not modify existing players but rather sets up the
    currency data that will be used when a new character is generated.
  parameters:
  - name: id
    description: The unique identifier for the currency type to set. This corresponds
      to the CurrencyType field in the game's currency database tables.
  - name: amount
    description: The initial amount of currency to assign to the player upon creation.
      Must be a non-negative integer value representing the quantity of the specified
      currency.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Set Starting Gold for New Character
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetCreateCurrency(1, 10000); // Sets 10,000 gold coins as starting currency'
    language: cpp
  - title: Configure Multiple Currency Types
    code: 'Player* player = new Player();

      player->SetCreateCurrency(1, 5000);   // 5,000 gold

      player->SetCreateCurrency(2, 250);    // 250 silver

      player->SetCreateCurrency(3, 1000);   // 1,000 copper'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method only affects currency values during player creation. Changes
    made after a character has been created will not impact existing players. The
    currency ID must correspond to valid entries in the game's currency database tables.
    This method should be called before the player object is fully initialized or
    saved to the database.
  warnings: Calling this method on an already-created player may have no effect or
    could cause unexpected behavior. Ensure that currency IDs are valid and exist
    in the game's database before calling this method. This method does not validate
    currency amounts for overflow conditions.
