  method: IsVellum
  signature: bool ItemTemplate::IsVellum() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether the item template represents a vellum material.
  description: The IsVellum method checks if the current item template corresponds
    to a vellum-based item, which are typically used in enchanting and crafting processes
    within World of Warcraft. Vellums are special materials that can be used to create
    enchantments or as part of various crafting recipes. This method returns true
    if the item is classified as a vellum, and false otherwise. The check is based
    on the item's class and subclass properties, specifically looking for items with
    the appropriate vellum classification in the game database.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the item template represents a vellum material; otherwise
    returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);\nif (itemTemplate->IsVellum())\
      \ {\n    printf(\"This item is a vellum.\\n\");\n} else {\n    printf(\"This\
      \ item is not a vellum.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Enchantment Crafting Check
    code: "ItemTemplate* vellum = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(25892); // Lesser Magic\
      \ Vellum\nif (vellum && vellum->IsVellum()) {\n    // Proceed with enchanting\
      \ logic\n    printf(\"Valid vellum for enchanting.\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method relies on the item's class and subclass values being correctly
    set in the database. Vellums are typically classified as 'Consumable' items with
    specific subclass values that identify them as vellum materials. The implementation
    may involve checking against predefined constants or database entries for valid
    vellum types.
  warnings: Ensure that the ItemTemplate object is properly initialized before calling
    this method, as calling it on a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
    Also note that this check only verifies the item type classification and does
    not validate if the item is actually usable or available for crafting.
