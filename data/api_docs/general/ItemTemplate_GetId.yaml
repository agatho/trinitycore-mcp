  method: GetId
  signature: uint32 ItemTemplate::GetId() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the unique identifier of the item template.
  description: The GetId method retrieves the unique identifier associated with an
    ItemTemplate object. This identifier corresponds to the entry ID in the game's
    item database, which is used to uniquely identify each distinct item type within
    the TrinityCore framework. The returned value serves as a primary key for item
    lookups and is essential for various game mechanics such as item spawning, inventory
    management, and crafting systems. This method is typically called when working
    with item prototypes or when needing to reference a specific item definition by
    its database entry.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint32 value representing the unique identifier (entry ID) of the item
    template in the game's database.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'ItemTemplate* itemTemplate = sObjectMgr->GetItemTemplate(12345);

      uint32 itemId = itemTemplate->GetId();

      // itemId will be 12345'
    language: cpp
  - title: In Inventory Context
    code: "Player* player = ...;\nItem* item = player->GetItemByGuid(itemGuid);\n\
      if (item)\n{\n    uint32 templateId = item->GetTemplate()->GetId();\n    //\
      \ Use templateId for further processing\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is a simple getter that directly returns the internal ID field
    of the ItemTemplate. It's safe to call from any thread context as long as the
    ItemTemplate object itself is valid and not being modified concurrently. The returned
    ID directly maps to the 'entry' field in the item_template database table.
