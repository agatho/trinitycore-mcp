  class: StatementClassifier
  method: StatementClassifier
  signature: void StatementClassifier::StatementClassifier()
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new instance of the StatementClassifier class for processing
    and categorizing SQL statements in TrinityCore.
  description: The StatementClassifier constructor initializes the internal state
    of the classifier object. This method sets up necessary data structures and configurations
    required for classifying different types of SQL statements used within the TrinityCore
    database system. It prepares the object to handle various statement categories
    such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and other SQL operations that are commonly
    executed against the World of Warcraft server database. The initialization process
    ensures that subsequent classification operations can be performed efficiently
    without requiring additional setup steps.

  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic instantiation of StatementClassifier
    code: 'StatementClassifier classifier;

      // The classifier is now ready to classify SQL statements'
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any heavy initialization or database connections.
    It simply prepares the internal state for statement classification operations.
    The actual classification logic will be invoked through other methods in the class.
