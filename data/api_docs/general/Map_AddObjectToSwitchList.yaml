  class: Map
  method: AddObjectToSwitchList
  signature: void Map::AddObjectToSwitchList(WorldObject * obj, bool on)
documentation:
  brief: Adds or removes a WorldObject from the map's switch list for terrain swapping
    operations.
  description: The AddObjectToSwitchList method manages the inclusion or exclusion
    of a WorldObject in the map's internal switch list, which is used during terrain
    swapping operations. This functionality is crucial for maintaining proper object
    visibility and interaction when the map's terrain changes dynamically. The method
    takes a pointer to a WorldObject and a boolean flag indicating whether to add
    (true) or remove (false) the object from the switch list. Objects in this list
    are processed during terrain swaps to ensure they maintain correct positioning
    and visibility relative to the new terrain state.
  parameters:
  - name: obj
    description: Pointer to the WorldObject to be added or removed from the switch
      list. Must not be null.
  - name: 'on'
    description: 'Boolean flag indicating the operation: true to add the object to
      the switch list, false to remove it.'
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Adding an Object to Switch List
    code: 'Player* player = ...;

      map->AddObjectToSwitchList(player, true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Removing an Object from Switch List
    code: 'Creature* creature = ...;

      map->AddObjectToSwitchList(creature, false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the core engine during terrain
    swap operations. Developers should not generally need to call this directly unless
    implementing custom terrain handling logic. The switch list is used primarily
    for objects that require special handling when map terrain changes, such as creatures
    or game objects with specific positioning requirements.
  warnings: Calling this method with a null object pointer will likely cause a crash.
    Ensure the WorldObject pointer is valid before calling. This method should not
    be called during active terrain swap operations as it may interfere with the process.
