  method: IsPushedToPartyOnAccept
  signature: bool Quest::IsPushedToPartyOnAccept() const
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a quest is pushed to party members upon acceptance.
  description: This method checks if a quest will automatically be shared with party
    members when the player accepts it. It returns true if the quest is set to push
    to party members, false otherwise. This behavior is controlled by the quest's
    flags and determines whether other players in the party will receive the quest
    automatically upon acceptance. The method is commonly used in quest handling logic
    to determine party sharing behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the quest is pushed to party members on acceptance, false
    otherwise. This indicates whether the quest will be shared with party members
    when accepted.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (quest->IsPushedToPartyOnAccept()) {\n    // Quest will be shared with\
      \ party members\n    // Do something here\n}\nelse {\n    // Quest will not\
      \ be shared with party members\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other quest-related methods
    to determine the complete behavior of a quest when accepted. It's part of the
    quest system's flag handling mechanism and should be used in context with other
    quest properties.
  warnings: This method should not be used to determine if a quest is actually pushed
    to party members, as it only indicates the intended behavior. The actual push
    behavior may depend on additional factors like player level differences or quest
    requirements.
