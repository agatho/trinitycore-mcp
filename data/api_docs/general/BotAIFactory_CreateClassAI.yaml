  class: BotAIFactory
  method: CreateClassAI
  signature: int BotAIFactory::CreateClassAI(Player * bot, uint8 classId, uint8 spec)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes an AI instance for a bot based on the specified class
    and specialization.
  description: The CreateClassAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a class-specific AI behavior for a given bot player. It takes the bot's class
    ID and specialization ID as inputs to determine which AI type should be created.
    This method is typically invoked during bot creation or when a bot's class changes,
    ensuring that the bot behaves according to its designated class mechanics and
    abilities. The returned integer indicates the success status of the operation,
    with zero typically representing success and non-zero values indicating various
    error conditions such as invalid class IDs or unsupported specializations.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot for which the AI
      is being created. Must not be null.
  - name: classId
    description: The class identifier of the bot, used to determine which AI behavior
      to instantiate. Valid values correspond to standard World of Warcraft class
      IDs (e.g., 1 = Warrior, 2 = Paladin, etc.).
  - name: spec
    description: The specialization ID for the bot's class. Used to further customize
      the AI behavior based on the chosen spec. A value of 0 typically indicates the
      default or primary spec.
  returns: An integer representing the success status of the operation. Returns 0
    on successful creation of the AI, and a non-zero value on failure. Possible error
    codes may include invalid class ID, unsupported specialization, or memory allocation
    issues.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Bot AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot pointer\nint result = BotAIFactory::CreateClassAI(bot,\
      \ CLASS_WARRIOR, 0);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI created successfully\n}\
      \ else {\n    // Handle error\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Creating Mage Bot with Fire Specialization
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid bot pointer\nint result = BotAIFactory::CreateClassAI(bot,\
      \ CLASS_MAGE, SPEC_MAGE_FIRE);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // Fire Mage AI created\
      \ successfully\n} else {\n    // Handle error\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the TrinityCore bot AI system and assumes that the
    provided Player object has been properly initialized. It may perform internal
    checks for valid class and spec combinations, potentially throwing exceptions
    or returning errors if unsupported configurations are passed.
  warnings: Passing invalid classId or spec values can lead to undefined behavior
    or failed AI creation. Always validate input parameters before calling this method
    to avoid runtime errors in the bot system.
