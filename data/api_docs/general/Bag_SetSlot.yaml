  class: Bag
  method: SetSlot
  signature: void Bag::SetSlot(int slot, int guid)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the GUID of an item in a specific slot of the bag.
  description: The SetSlot method assigns a unique identifier (GUID) to a specified
    slot within a Bag object. This method is typically used during item management
    operations, such as when adding or moving items between inventory slots. The slot
    parameter refers to the index position within the bag's internal array, while
    the guid parameter represents the identifier of the item being placed in that
    slot. It is important to ensure that the slot index is valid and within the bounds
    of the bag's capacity to avoid memory corruption or undefined behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: slot
    description: The zero-based index position within the bag where the item should
      be placed. Must be a valid index within the range [0, Bag::GetBagSize()).
  - name: guid
    description: The unique identifier (GUID) of the item to be stored in the specified
      slot. A value of 0 typically indicates an empty slot.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Setting an Item in a Bag Slot
    code: 'Bag* myBag = player->GetBag(0);

      myBag->SetSlot(3, 123456789); // Places item with GUID 123456789 into slot 3
      of the bag'
    language: cpp
  - title: Clearing a Bag Slot
    code: 'Bag* myBag = player->GetBag(0);

      myBag->SetSlot(3, 0); // Clears slot 3 by setting its GUID to 0'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method does not perform any validation on the provided GUID or slot
    index. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure these values are valid. The
    method directly modifies internal state and should be used carefully in multi-threaded
    environments where synchronization is required.
  warnings: Calling this method with an invalid slot index can lead to memory corruption
    or access violations. Always verify that the slot number is within the bounds
    of the bag's size before calling SetSlot. Additionally, setting a GUID to zero
    effectively removes an item from the slot without triggering any removal events
    or callbacks.
