  class: MountManager
  method: LearnMount
  signature: bool MountManager::LearnMount(int * player, uint32 spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Teaches a player a mount spell by its ID, returning true on success.
  description: The LearnMount method attempts to grant a specified mount spell to
    a player character. It takes a pointer to a player object and a spell identifier,
    then processes the learning of that mount spell for the given player. This method
    is typically used in game systems where players acquire mounts through quests,
    vendors, or other gameplay mechanics. The function returns true if the mount was
    successfully learned, or false if it fails due to invalid parameters or other
    issues. It's important to note that this method likely interacts with the player's
    spellbook and mount collection systems within TrinityCore.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the character who will
      learn the mount. Must be a valid pointer to an active player instance.
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the mount spell to be learned. This should
      correspond to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database that represents
      a mount ability.
  returns: True if the mount spell was successfully added to the player's spellbook
    and mount collection, false otherwise. Failure may occur due to invalid player
    pointer, invalid spell ID, or other internal validation checks.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Mount Learning
    code: "Player* player = ...; // Get player reference\nuint32 mountSpellId = 34090;\
      \ // Example mount spell ID\nbool result = sMountMgr->LearnMount(&player, mountSpellId);\n\
      if (result)\n{\n    // Mount successfully learned\n    player->SendSpellLearned(mountSpellId);\n\
      }"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely requires the player to be in a valid state for spell learning
    operations. It may internally call other subsystems such as SpellMgr or Player::AddSpell
    to properly register the mount. The method assumes that the provided spell ID
    corresponds to a legitimate mount spell within the TrinityCore database.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer for the player parameter will likely cause a crash
    or undefined behavior. Ensure that the spellId is valid and represents an actual
    mount spell before calling this function. Improper use may lead to inconsistent
    character state or client-side issues.
