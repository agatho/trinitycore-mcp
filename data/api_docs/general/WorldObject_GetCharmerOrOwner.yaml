  signature: Unit * WorldObject::GetCharmerOrOwner() const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the Unit that owns or charms the current WorldObject.
  description: The GetCharmerOrOwner method retrieves the Unit object that is either
    the owner or charmer of the current WorldObject. This method is commonly used
    in the context of pet and summon behavior within World of Warcraft, where a creature
    or player may be controlled by another unit. The returned Unit can be a player,
    creature, or any other unit type that has control over the object. If no such
    owner or charmer exists, the method returns nullptr. This function is essential
    for determining the relationship between objects in game mechanics involving summoning,
    pet control, and AI behavior.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the Unit that owns or charms the current WorldObject.
    If no such unit exists, it returns nullptr. The returned Unit can be either a
    player or creature depending on the context of the object's ownership.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "Unit* owner = object->GetCharmerOrOwner();\nif (owner != nullptr)\n{\n\
      \    std::cout << \"Owner is: \" << owner->GetGUID() << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other methods that check
    for ownership or control. It may return nullptr if the object has no charmer or
    owner, such as in cases where a player is not controlling a pet or summon. Performance
    considerations are minimal, but care should be taken when using this method in
    loops to avoid unnecessary overhead.
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where the object may have
    multiple owners or charmers, as it only returns one specific unit. Also, be cautious
    about dereferencing the returned pointer without checking for null, which could
    lead to crashes if the object has no owner.
