  signature: void FormationMovementGenerator::DoDeactivate(Creature * param0)
documentation:
  brief: Deactivates the formation movement generator for a creature, stopping its
    formation behavior.
  description: The DoDeactivate method is responsible for deactivating a FormationMovementGenerator
    instance, which typically occurs when a creature's formation behavior needs to
    be halted or reset. This method is part of the AI movement system in TrinityCore
    and is called internally by the game engine when the formation movement should
    cease. It ensures that any ongoing formation-related movement is properly stopped
    and cleans up internal state. The method does not take any parameters, as it operates
    on the instance's own data. This typically happens when a creature leaves a formation,
    dies, or when the AI system decides to switch movement behaviors.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage in AI context
    code: "void SomeCreatureAI::OnDeath()\n{\n    if (m_movementGenerator && m_movementGenerator->GetMovementGeneratorType()\
      \ == FORMATION_MOVEMENT)\n    {\n        m_movementGenerator->DoDeactivate();\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically called internally by the TrinityCore AI system and
    should not be invoked directly in most cases. It's part of a larger movement generator
    pattern and interacts with creature AI state management. The method likely resets
    internal flags or pointers related to formation behavior.
  warnings: Direct invocation of this method outside of the proper AI lifecycle may
    lead to inconsistent AI behavior or memory issues. Always ensure that the movement
    generator is in a valid state before calling DoDeactivate.
