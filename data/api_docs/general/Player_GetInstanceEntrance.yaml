  class: Player
  method: GetInstanceEntrance
  signature: const WorldSafeLocsEntry * Player::GetInstanceEntrance(uint32 targetMapId)
documentation:
  brief: Returns the world safe location entry for a player's instance entrance based
    on target map ID.
  description: This method retrieves the WorldSafeLocsEntry associated with a player's
    instance entrance for a specific target map. It is used to determine the safe
    location coordinates where players should be teleported when entering instances.
    The method typically returns NULL for non-instance maps or when no valid safe
    location exists for the specified map. This functionality is crucial for maintaining
    proper game mechanics related to instance entry and exit points, ensuring players
    are placed correctly in the world upon entering or leaving dungeons.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns a pointer to the WorldSafeLocsEntry structure which contains the
    safe location coordinates for the instance entrance, or NULL if no valid entry
    exists for the target map ID.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "const WorldSafeLocsEntry* entry = player->GetInstanceEntrance(123);\nif\
      \ (entry)\n{\n    // Use entry->X, entry->Y, entry->Z\n}\nelse\n{\n    // Handle\
      \ no valid entry case\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with instance management systems
    and may be called during player entry/exit operations. Performance considerations
    include checking for valid map IDs before calling this method.
  warnings: Care should be taken when using this method as it may return NULL for
    invalid or non-instance maps, potentially causing null pointer dereferences if
    not properly handled in code.
