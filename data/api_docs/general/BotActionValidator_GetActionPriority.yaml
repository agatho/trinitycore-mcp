  class: BotActionValidator
  method: GetActionPriority
  signature: uint8 BotActionValidator::GetActionPriority(BotActionTypeExtended type)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves the priority level of a specified bot action type for execution
    ordering.
  description: The GetActionPriority method returns a uint8 value representing the
    priority level assigned to a specific BotActionTypeExtended. This priority determines
    the order in which bot actions are executed, with higher values indicating higher
    priority. The method is typically used within the TrinityCore AI system to manage
    how bot characters prioritize their behavior and decision-making processes. It
    ensures that critical actions such as combat responses or emergency escapes are
    executed before less urgent tasks like looting or movement.
  parameters: []
  returns: A uint8 value representing the priority level of the specified bot action
    type. Higher values indicate higher priority, with 0 typically representing the
    lowest priority or no priority assigned.
  examples:
  - title: Retrieve Priority for Attack Action
    code: 'uint8 priority = validator.GetActionPriority(BotActionTypeExtended::ATTACK);

      // Returns the priority level for attack actions, e.g., 100'
    language: cpp
  - title: Use Priority in Action Selection Logic
    code: "if (validator.GetActionPriority(BotActionTypeExtended::ESCAPE) > validator.GetActionPriority(BotActionTypeExtended::LOOT))\
      \ {\n    // Execute escape action before loot\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely part of a larger bot AI framework and may be used in
    conjunction with other priority-based systems. The actual priority values are
    determined by the internal configuration or rules defined for each bot action
    type within the TrinityCore codebase.
