  method: CreateWarriorAI
  signature: int EnhancedBotAIFactory::CreateWarriorAI(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Creates and initializes a new warrior AI for the specified bot player.
  description: The CreateWarriorAI method is responsible for instantiating and configuring
    a warrior AI behavior for a given bot player within the TrinityCore framework.
    This function likely allocates memory for a warrior-specific AI instance, sets
    up combat strategies, assigns appropriate abilities and spells, and initializes
    the AI's decision-making logic tailored for warrior class gameplay. The method
    operates within the EnhancedBotAI system, which extends standard AI functionality
    to provide more sophisticated bot behavior. It is typically called when a new
    warrior bot needs to be created or when an existing bot's AI needs to be reset
    or reinitialized. The function may also handle integration with the bot's inventory
    management, target selection, and tactical decision-making systems specific to
    warrior gameplay mechanics.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns an integer value indicating the success or failure status of the
    AI creation process. A return value of 0 typically indicates successful creation,
    while non-zero values may represent various error conditions such as invalid player
    reference, memory allocation failure, or unsupported class type. The exact meaning
    of different return codes should be verified against the implementation source.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Warrior AI Creation
    code: "Player* bot = ...; // Assume bot is a valid Player pointer\nint result\
      \ = factory->CreateWarriorAI(bot);\nif (result == 0) {\n    // AI successfully\
      \ created\n    printf(\"Warrior AI created successfully\\n\");\n} else {\n \
      \   // Handle error\n    printf(\"Failed to create warrior AI, error code: %d\\\
      n\", result);\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the EnhancedBotAI system and requires that the bot
    player object is properly initialized and valid. The AI instance created will
    inherit from a base AI class but implements warrior-specific behaviors including
    stance management, ability prioritization, and combat tactics. Developers should
    ensure proper cleanup of AI instances to prevent memory leaks when bots are destroyed
    or replaced.
  warnings: Calling this method on an invalid player pointer may result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. The method assumes the bot player is already registered with
    the system and has appropriate class data. Improper use without checking player
    validity can lead to segmentation faults or corrupted AI state.
