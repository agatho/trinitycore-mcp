  class: Creature
  method: SetCorpseDelay
  signature: void Creature::SetCorpseDelay(uint32 delay, bool ignoreCorpseDecayRatio)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the corpse delay for a creature, controlling how long it remains before
    being removed.
  description: The SetCorpseDelay method allows developers to control the duration
    a creature's corpse remains in the world before being automatically removed. This
    is particularly useful for managing mob behavior and ensuring proper game balance.
    The delay parameter specifies the time in seconds, while ignoreCorpseDecayRatio
    determines whether the standard decay ratio should be applied or not. When ignoreCorpseDecayRatio
    is set to true, the corpse will remain for the full specified delay regardless
    of decay settings.
  parameters:
  - name: delay
    description: The time in seconds that the creature's corpse should remain before
      being removed. Valid values are typically between 0 and 3600 seconds (1 hour).
  - name: ignoreCorpseDecayRatio
    description: When set to true, ignores the standard decay ratio applied to corpses,
      ensuring the full delay period is observed regardless of game mechanics.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      creature->SetCorpseDelay(300, true);

      // Sets the corpse to remain for 5 minutes (300 seconds) with no decay ratio
      applied'
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced Usage Example
    code: 'Creature* creature = new Creature();

      uint32 delay = 1800;

      bool ignore = false;

      creature->SetCorpseDelay(delay, ignore);

      // Sets the corpse to remain for 30 minutes with decay ratio applied

      // This allows for more precise control over mob behavior in different scenarios'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used during creature AI scripting or when configuring
    mob behavior. The delay value should be carefully considered to avoid game imbalance
    or unexpected behavior. Performance considerations include the impact on server
    memory usage if too many creatures are set with long delays.
  warnings: Setting very high values can cause server memory issues and may interfere
    with normal game mechanics. Care should be taken when using ignoreCorpseDecayRatio
    as it may affect quest completion or loot behavior in some cases.
