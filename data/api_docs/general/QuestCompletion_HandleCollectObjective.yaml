  signature: void QuestCompletion::HandleCollectObjective(Player * bot, QuestObjectiveData
    & objective)
documentation:
  brief: Processes and handles the collection of quest objectives for a player bot.
  description: The HandleCollectObjective method is responsible for managing the completion
    of quest objectives that involve collecting items or resources. It takes a player
    bot and a quest objective data structure as input, and performs necessary checks
    to determine if the objective has been fulfilled. This method typically updates
    the player's quest progress, triggers related events, and may award rewards or
    update quest status accordingly. The function is part of the automated quest completion
    system in TrinityCore, enabling bots to efficiently manage and report on quest
    progress without manual intervention.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that is processing
      the quest objective. This player must be valid and have an active quest in progress
      matching the objective.
  - name: objective
    description: Reference to a QuestObjectiveData structure containing information
      about the specific objective to be processed, including type, required quantity,
      item ID, or other relevant parameters for collection.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: 'Player* bot = ...; // Assume valid player object

      QuestObjectiveData objective;

      objective.type = QUEST_OBJECTIVE_TYPE_ITEM;

      objective.requiredCount = 5;

      objective.itemId = 12345;

      questCompletion.HandleCollectObjective(bot, objective);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method assumes that the player bot has an active quest with matching
    objectives. It should only be called when the bot's inventory contains sufficient
    items or resources to fulfill the objective. The method does not perform any validation
    on whether the objective is actually completable, so callers must ensure preconditions
    are met.
  warnings: Calling this method without verifying that the player has the required
    items or resources may lead to unexpected behavior or quest state corruption.
    Ensure that all necessary checks are performed before invoking this function.
