  method: AssignEventRoles
  signature: void GuildEventCoordinator::AssignEventRoles(int * player, uint32 eventId)
documentation:
  brief: Assigns roles to players for a specified guild event based on their participation
    and guild hierarchy.
  description: The AssignEventRoles method is responsible for determining and assigning
    appropriate roles to players within a guild event. This function evaluates player
    participation, guild rank, and other relevant criteria to assign roles such as
    organizer, participant, or observer. The method operates on a provided array of
    player identifiers and updates their role assignments in the context of the specified
    event ID. It is typically invoked during event creation or when player permissions
    need to be reassessed for ongoing events.
  parameters:
  - name: player
    description: Pointer to an integer array containing player identifiers (GUIDs)
      that will have roles assigned for the event.
  - name: eventId
    description: Unique identifier of the guild event for which player roles are being
      assigned. Must correspond to an existing event in the system.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Role Assignment
    code: 'int players[] = {1001, 1002, 1003};

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.AssignEventRoles(players, 501);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Dynamic Role Assignment for Event
    code: 'std::vector<int> playerList = {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004};

      GuildEventCoordinator coordinator;

      coordinator.AssignEventRoles(playerList.data(), 501);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely interacts with internal guild and event systems to validate
    player eligibility and rank before assigning roles. It may also trigger updates
    to the event's participant list or role distribution UI elements.
  warnings: Ensure that all player GUIDs in the input array are valid and correspond
    to active players in the guild, as invalid entries may cause undefined behavior
    or system errors.
