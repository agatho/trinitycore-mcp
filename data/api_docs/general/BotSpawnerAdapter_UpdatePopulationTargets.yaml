  brief: Updates the population targets for bot spawning in the game world.
  description: The UpdatePopulationTargets method recalculates and adjusts the target
    numbers of bots to be spawned across different zones or areas within the game
    world. This method is typically invoked during periodic updates or when configuration
    changes occur, ensuring that the number of active bots aligns with defined population
    goals. It may consider factors such as player density, zone activity levels, and
    server load to determine appropriate bot counts for each area.

    interval or in response to configuration changes. It may involve calculations
    based on current player activity and server capacity.
