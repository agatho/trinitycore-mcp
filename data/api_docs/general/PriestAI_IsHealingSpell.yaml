api:
  class: PriestAI
  method: IsHealingSpell
  signature: bool PriestAI::IsHealingSpell(int spellId)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified spell ID corresponds to a healing spell used
    by the Priest class.
  description: The IsHealingSpell method checks if a given spell ID represents a healing
    spell within the context of the Priest AI behavior. This function is typically
    used by the PriestAI class to differentiate between damage-dealing and healing
    spells when making tactical decisions during combat. It evaluates the spell's
    properties and categorization to determine if it should be considered part of
    the priest's healing repertoire. The method plays a crucial role in spell selection
    logic for priests, particularly for abilities like Flash Heal, Greater Heal, and
    Prayer of Healing.
  parameters:
  - name: spellId
    description: The unique identifier of the spell to evaluate. This should correspond
      to a valid spell entry in the game's spell database.
  returns: Returns true if the specified spell ID is recognized as a healing spell
    for the Priest class; otherwise, returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: "if (priestAI->IsHealingSpell(2061)) {\n    // Handle healing spell logic\n\
      \    printf(\"This is a healing spell: Flash Heal\\n\");\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with Spell Casting Logic
    code: "void PriestAI::UpdateAI(uint32 diff) {\n    if (me->HasUnitState(UNIT_STATE_CASTING))\n\
      \        return;\n\n    SpellInfo const* spellInfo = sSpellMgr->GetSpellInfo(currentSpellId);\n\
      \    if (spellInfo && IsHealingSpell(currentSpellId)) {\n        // Prioritize\
      \ healing over damage in certain situations\n        DoCastVictim(spellInfo);\n\
      \    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method likely relies on internal spell categorization data within TrinityCore's
    spell system. The implementation may cache or pre-process spell information for
    performance reasons. Developers should be aware that spell IDs can vary between
    different versions of the game and expansions.
  warnings: Ensure that the spellId parameter is valid before calling this method,
    as invalid spell IDs might cause unexpected behavior or crashes. This method assumes
    the spell belongs to the Priest class; it may not correctly identify healing spells
    from other classes.
