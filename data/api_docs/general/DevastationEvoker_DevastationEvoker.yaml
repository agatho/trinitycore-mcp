  method: DevastationEvoker
  signature: void DevastationEvoker::DevastationEvoker(Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Initializes a new DevastationEvoker instance with the specified player bot.
  description: The DevastationEvoker constructor initializes a new instance of the
    DevastationEvoker class, associating it with a specific Player object that acts
    as the bot. This method sets up internal state and configuration for the evoker's
    behavior within the TrinityCore framework. The constructor is typically called
    during AI initialization when a player-controlled NPC or bot needs to be configured
    with DevastationEvoker functionality. It prepares the instance for subsequent
    operations such as spell casting, target selection, and combat behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot that this DevastationEvoker
      instance will control. Must not be null.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Initialization
    code: 'Player* myBot = ...; // Get or create a player bot

      DevastationEvoker evoker(myBot);

      // The evoker is now initialized and ready for use'
    language: cpp
  - title: Integration with AI System
    code: "class MyAI : public PlayerbotAI {\npublic:\n    void Initialize() override\
      \ {\n        if (GetBot()->getClass() == CLASS_EVOKER) {\n            evoker\
      \ = new DevastationEvoker(GetBot());\n        }\n    }\nprivate:\n    DevastationEvoker*\
      \ evoker;\n};"
    language: cpp
  notes: This constructor does not perform any complex initialization or resource
    allocation beyond setting up the internal reference to the bot. The actual AI
    behavior logic is typically implemented in separate methods that are called later
    during the AI update cycle. Developers should ensure the Player pointer is valid
    and represents a properly initialized bot before calling this constructor.
  warnings: Passing a null pointer to this constructor will likely result in undefined
    behavior or crashes. Always validate that the Player* parameter refers to a valid,
    initialized player object before creating a DevastationEvoker instance.
