documentation:
  brief: Destroys a CriteriaHandler instance and releases all associated resources.
  description: The destructor for the CriteriaHandler class is responsible for cleaning
    up any dynamically allocated memory or resources that were used during the object's
    lifetime. In the context of TrinityCore, this class likely manages criteria-related
    data such as achievement progress, quest requirements, or other player-based tracking
    systems. When a CriteriaHandler instance is destroyed, it ensures proper cleanup
    of internal data structures and prevents memory leaks. This destructor is automatically
    invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
  parameters: []
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Automatic destruction of CriteriaHandler
    code: "void SomeFunction()\n{\n    CriteriaHandler handler;\n    // ... use handler\
      \ ...\n    // handler is automatically destroyed here\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: The destructor should not be called directly unless the object was dynamically
    allocated. It's important to understand that this destructor may perform cleanup
    operations that are essential for maintaining data integrity in TrinityCore's
    achievement and criteria systems.
