documentation:
  brief: Returns the singleton instance of the AreaTriggerDataStore class
  description: The Instance method implements the singleton pattern for the AreaTriggerDataStore
    class, ensuring that only one instance of the data store exists throughout the
    application lifecycle. This method is commonly used to access global area trigger-related
    data and functionality. The returned pointer provides access to all area trigger
    definitions, templates, and associated metadata stored within the TrinityCore
    framework. This method is thread-safe and should be used whenever area trigger
    data needs to be accessed from various parts of the game engine.
  parameters: []
  returns: A pointer to the singleton instance of AreaTriggerDataStore. The method
    will always return a valid pointer, never NULL, as the singleton instance is guaranteed
    to exist once initialized.
  examples:
  - title: Accessing AreaTriggerDataStore Singleton
    code: "AreaTriggerDataStore* store = AreaTriggerDataStore::Instance();\n// Use\
      \ the store to access area trigger data\nuint32 triggerId = store->GetAreaTriggerIdByEntry(12345);\n\
      if (triggerId)\n{\n    // Process area trigger\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method follows the standard singleton pattern implementation. The AreaTriggerDataStore
    instance is typically initialized during server startup and remains valid for
    the entire application lifetime. Developers should be aware that accessing this
    singleton from multiple threads simultaneously is safe, but modifications to the
    data store should be properly synchronized.
