  class: LFGRoleDetector
  method: ClassCanDPS
  signature: bool LFGRoleDetector::ClassCanDPS(uint8 playerClass)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a specified player class is capable of fulfilling the
    Damage Per Second (DPS) role in LFG groups.
  description: The ClassCanDPS method evaluates if a given player class can be assigned
    to the DPS role within World of Warcraft's Looking For Group (LFG) system. This
    function is crucial for group matching algorithms that ensure players are placed
    in roles appropriate to their class capabilities. The method takes a uint8 parameter
    representing the player's class and returns a boolean value indicating whether
    that class is eligible for the DPS role. Classes such as Warriors, Rogues, Mages,
    and Hunters are typically considered DPS classes, while support classes like Priests
    or Druids may not be classified as primary DPS depending on their spec or role
    assignment in the LFG system.
  parameters:
  - name: playerClass
    description: An unsigned 8-bit integer representing the player's class ID. Valid
      values correspond to the standard WoW class enumeration (e.g., 1 = Warrior,
      2 = Paladin, 3 = Hunter, etc.). This parameter determines which class capabilities
      are evaluated for DPS eligibility.
  returns: Returns true if the specified player class is capable of fulfilling the
    DPS role in LFG groups; otherwise returns false. The method does not account for
    spec-specific role changes or temporary buffs that might alter a class's actual
    role during gameplay.
  examples:
  - title: Check if Warrior Class Can DPS
    code: "LFGRoleDetector detector;\nbool canDPS = detector.ClassCanDPS(1); // Warrior\
      \ class ID\nif (canDPS)\n{\n    // Proceed with LFG group assignment for DPS\
      \ role\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Iterate Through All Classes to Determine DPS Eligibility
    code: "LFGRoleDetector detector;\nfor (uint8 i = 1; i <= MAX_CLASSES; ++i)\n{\n\
      \    if (detector.ClassCanDPS(i))\n    {\n        std::cout << \"Class \" <<\
      \ static_cast<int>(i) << \" can fulfill DPS role.\\n\";\n    }\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of the LFG system's internal logic and should be used
    primarily for group composition validation rather than real-time gameplay decisions.
    The implementation likely uses predefined class-role mappings that align with
    standard WoW class capabilities, but may not reflect all edge cases such as specific
    talents or gear configurations that could change a class's role.
  warnings: This method only evaluates class-based eligibility and does not consider
    player specialization, talents, or current gear state which might affect actual
    DPS capability in a given encounter. Using this method for dynamic role assignment
    without considering these factors may lead to mismatched group compositions.
