  class: EscortAI
  method: SetDespawnAtFar
  signature: void EscortAI::SetDespawnAtFar(bool despawn)
documentation:
  brief: Sets whether the escort AI should despawn when the player moves far away.
  description: The SetDespawnAtFar method configures the behavior of an EscortAI instance
    to determine if it should automatically despawn when the player moves beyond a
    certain distance. This is commonly used in quest-related AI where NPCs escort
    players and need to be removed from the world once the player strays too far from
    the escort path. The method accepts a boolean parameter that enables or disables
    this behavior. When enabled, the AI will monitor the player's distance and trigger
    despawn logic if the distance exceeds predefined thresholds.
  parameters:
  - name: despawn
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      despawning when the player moves far away from the escort AI.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable despawn at far distance
    code: ' EscortAI* escort = new EscortAI();

      escort->SetDespawnAtFar(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable despawn at far distance
    code: 'EscortAI* escort = GetEscortAI();

      escort->SetDespawnAtFar(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other EscortAI methods
    such as Start(), UpdateAI(), and WaypointReached(). The actual distance threshold
    for despawning is usually defined by the core's configuration or hardcoded values
    within the AI implementation. This behavior is commonly seen in quest NPCs that
    are meant to follow players but should not remain active if the player leaves
    the area.
  warnings: Be cautious when disabling this feature, as it may lead to NPC entities
    remaining in the world indefinitely if not handled properly. Ensure proper cleanup
    of escort AI instances to prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior in long-running
    quests.
