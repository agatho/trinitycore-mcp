  class: KitingManager
  method: IsPositionSafe
  signature: bool KitingManager::IsPositionSafe(const int & pos, const int & threats)
documentation:
  brief: Determines whether a given position is safe from threats in the kiting manager's
    context.
  description: The IsPositionSafe method evaluates if a specified position is considered
    safe based on the current threat level and positioning logic within the KitingManager.
    This method is typically used in AI-driven movement decisions to ensure that a
    player or creature does not move into a dangerous area where threats are present.
    It considers factors such as proximity to enemies, threat levels, and environmental
    constraints to make this determination. The method returns true if the position
    is deemed safe, and false otherwise.
  parameters:
  - name: pos
    description: The position identifier or index that needs to be evaluated for safety.
      This typically represents a location in the game world or a specific point within
      an AI's movement path.
  - name: threats
    description: The threat level or identifier representing current threats at the
      specified position. This value indicates how dangerous the area is, often based
      on enemy proximity or other hostile factors.
  returns: Returns true if the given position is considered safe under the current
    threat conditions; otherwise returns false.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage of IsPositionSafe
    code: "if (kitingManager.IsPositionSafe(5, 10)) {\n    // Move to position 5 as\
      \ it's safe\n    player->MoveTo(5);\n} else {\n    // Avoid position 5 due to\
      \ high threat level\n    player->Flee();\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is likely used in conjunction with other kiting AI logic to determine
    optimal movement paths. It may involve calculations based on distance, threat
    radius, and movement speed of the entity.
  warnings: Ensure that both 'pos' and 'threats' are valid identifiers before calling
    this method to avoid undefined behavior or incorrect safety assessments.
