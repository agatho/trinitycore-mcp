  class: BotThreatManager
  method: SetUpdateInterval
  signature: void BotThreatManager::SetUpdateInterval(uint32 intervalMs)
documentation:
  brief: Sets the update interval for the bot threat manager in milliseconds.
  description: The SetUpdateInterval method configures how frequently the bot threat
    manager updates its internal threat calculations and state tracking. This interval
    determines the frequency at which the AI evaluates target threat levels, adjusts
    behavior accordingly, and synchronizes threat data with the game's combat system.
    The update interval directly impacts both the responsiveness of bot AI decisions
    and system performance, as more frequent updates consume more CPU cycles while
    less frequent updates may cause delayed reactions to changing combat conditions.
  parameters:
  - name: intervalMs
    description: The update interval in milliseconds. Valid values are typically between
      50ms and 1000ms, with lower values providing more responsive but CPU-intensive
      behavior, and higher values offering better performance at the cost of responsiveness.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatMgr = bot->GetThreatManager();

      threatMgr->SetUpdateInterval(200); // Update every 200ms'
    language: cpp
  - title: Performance Optimization
    code: 'BotThreatManager* threatMgr = bot->GetThreatManager();

      threatMgr->SetUpdateInterval(500); // Reduce update frequency for better performance'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly affects the bot's combat behavior and responsiveness.
    Setting very low intervals (below 50ms) may cause performance issues in high-combat
    scenarios, while setting very high intervals (above 1000ms) can result in noticeable
    delays in threat-based AI decisions.
  warnings: Changing the update interval while a bot is actively engaged in combat
    may cause temporary inconsistencies in threat calculations. It's recommended to
    set this value during initialization or when the bot is not in combat.
