  class: QuestValidation
  method: GetRecommendationsForFailedQuest
  signature: int QuestValidation::GetRecommendationsForFailedQuest(uint32 questId,
    Player * bot)
documentation:
  brief: Retrieves recommended quest IDs for a bot player when a specific quest has
    failed.
  description: The GetRecommendationsForFailedQuest method determines and returns
    a list of alternative quests that should be offered to a player's bot character
    when a specified quest fails. This functionality is typically used in automated
    questing systems or quest recommendation engines within the TrinityCore framework.
    The method evaluates the state of the bot, the failed quest's requirements, and
    the overall quest progression to suggest appropriate follow-up or alternative
    quests. It ensures that players do not get stuck in quest loops and can continue
    their progression smoothly even when they fail certain objectives.
  parameters:
  - name: questId
    description: The unique identifier of the quest that has failed. This must correspond
      to a valid quest entry in the database.
  - name: bot
    description: Pointer to the Player object representing the bot character for which
      recommendations are being generated. Must not be null and should represent an
      active bot player.
  returns: An integer value representing the number of recommended quests returned.
    A return value of 0 indicates no recommendations were found or the method failed
    to process. Positive integers indicate successful retrieval of that many quest
    IDs.
  examples:
  - title: Basic Usage Example
    code: "uint32 failedQuestId = 12345;\nPlayer* botPlayer = ...; // Assume valid\
      \ bot player\nint numRecommendations = QuestValidation::GetRecommendationsForFailedQuest(failedQuestId,\
      \ botPlayer);\nif (numRecommendations > 0)\n{\n    // Process the recommended\
      \ quests\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is part of a larger quest validation system and relies on internal
    quest data structures. It assumes that the provided quest ID exists in the database
    and that the bot player has valid quest state information. The implementation
    may cache results or perform database queries depending on the internal design.
  warnings: Ensure that the questId parameter corresponds to an actual existing quest
    in the database; otherwise, behavior is undefined. Also, make sure the bot pointer
    is valid and points to a properly initialized Player object, as passing null or
    invalid pointers can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
