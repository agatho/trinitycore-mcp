  class: EconomyManager
  method: SetAutoSellJunk
  signature: void EconomyManager::SetAutoSellJunk(bool enable)
documentation:
  brief: Enables or disables the automatic selling of junk items in the player's inventory.
  description: The SetAutoSellJunk method configures whether the EconomyManager will
    automatically sell junk items (items with no value or utility) from a player's
    inventory. When enabled, the system will periodically scan the inventory and sell
    qualifying junk items, typically at a vendor or through a designated mechanism.
    This feature helps players manage their inventory space and gold more efficiently
    by automating the disposal of unwanted items. The method does not perform any
    immediate selling; it only sets the flag that controls the behavior for future
    operations. This setting is usually persistent across sessions and may be tied
    to player preferences or game settings.
  parameters:
  - name: enable
    description: A boolean value indicating whether to enable (true) or disable (false)
      automatic junk selling.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Enable Auto-Sell Junk Feature
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->SetAutoSellJunk(true);'
    language: cpp
  - title: Disable Auto-Sell Junk Feature
    code: 'EconomyManager* economyMgr = player->GetEconomyManager();

      economyMgr->SetAutoSellJunk(false);'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method modifies internal state that may be used by the EconomyManager's
    inventory processing loop. Changes take effect on subsequent inventory scans or
    operations, not immediately. The behavior of what constitutes a 'junk' item is
    defined elsewhere in the system and typically includes items below a certain quality
    threshold or those with zero sell value.
