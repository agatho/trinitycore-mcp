documentation:
  brief: Checks if the unit is currently in flight mode.
  description: This method determines whether a unit (such as a player or creature)
    is currently in flight mode, which typically occurs when the unit is airborne
    and moving through the air. The method returns true if the unit is in flight,
    false otherwise. This functionality is commonly used in game mechanics to determine
    movement status during combat or when performing actions that require the unit
    to be airborne.
  parameters: []
  returns: Returns true if the unit is currently in flight mode, false otherwise.
    This indicates the unit's movement state and whether it is airborne.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "if (unit->IsInFlight()) {\n    // Unit is currently flying\n    // Do something\
      \ specific to flying units\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  - title: Combat scenario example
    code: "if (unit->IsInFlight() && unit->GetDistance(target) < 10) {\n    // Unit\
      \ is flying and close to target\n    // Can perform aerial attacks or special\
      \ abilities\n}\n"
    language: cpp
  notes: 'Implementation details: This method likely checks internal movement state
    flags within the unit''s data structure. Performance considerations: The method
    should be fast as it typically involves simple flag checking rather than complex
    calculations. Thread safety: This method is generally safe to call from multiple
    threads, though it may not be thread-safe if the unit''s state changes during
    execution.'
  warnings: This method should not be used in scenarios where precise movement state
    is required, as it only indicates whether a unit is airborne, not necessarily
    whether it is actively moving or performing specific actions. Common mistakes
    include confusing this with other movement-related methods like IsOnGround or
    IsInWater.
