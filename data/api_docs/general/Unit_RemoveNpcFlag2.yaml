  class: Unit
  method: RemoveNpcFlag2
  signature: void Unit::RemoveNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2 flags)
documentation:
  brief: Removes a specific NPC flag from the unit's flags.
  description: This method removes the specified NPCFlags2 from the Unit's flags,
    effectively removing a particular flag that defines the NPC's behavior or status.
    The method is typically used to modify the NPC's flag configuration during gameplay,
    such as when an NPC should no longer be considered a quest giver or vendor. It
    is part of the broader set of methods for managing NPC flags in TrinityCore, and
    should be used carefully to avoid unintended behavior changes.
  parameters:
  - name: flags
    description: The NPCFlags2 value to remove from the unit's flags. This represents
      a specific flag that defines the NPC's status or behavior within the game world.
  returns: null
  examples:
  - title: Remove Quest Giver Flag
    code: 'Unit->RemoveNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2::NPC_FLAG_QUESTGIVER);

      // This removes the quest giver flag from the NPC, making it no longer a quest
      giver.'
    language: cpp
  - title: Remove Vendor Flag
    code: 'Unit->RemoveNpcFlag2(NPCFlags2::NPC_FLAG_VENDOR);

      // This removes the vendor flag from the NPC, making it no longer a vendor.'
    language: cpp
  notes: This method directly modifies the unit's flags and should be used with caution.
    It is recommended to check the current flags before removing any flag to avoid
    unintended side effects. The method does not return any value, as it is a void
    function.
  warnings: Improper use of this method may lead to NPCs losing their intended behavior
    or status in the game world. Care should be taken when removing flags to ensure
    that the NPC remains properly configured for its role in the game.
