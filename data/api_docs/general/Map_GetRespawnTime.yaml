  class: Map
  method: GetRespawnTime
  signature: time_t Map::GetRespawnTime(SpawnObjectType type, int spawnId) const
documentation:
  brief: Returns the respawn time of a specific spawn object type and ID.
  description: This method retrieves the respawn time for a given spawn object type
    and ID within the map. It is used to determine when a particular game object or
    creature will respawn after being destroyed or despawned. The method returns a
    time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the spawn will respawn, allowing
    developers to calculate time remaining until respawn or handle respawn logic in
    their code. This functionality is essential for managing dynamic world content
    and ensuring proper game mechanics behavior.
  parameters:
  - name: type
    description: The spawn object type (creature or gameobject) that the method is
      querying for. Valid values are typically SpawnObjectType::Creature or SpawnObjectType::GameObject.
  - name: spawnId
    description: The unique identifier of the specific spawn object within its type
      category. This ID corresponds to the entry or guid of the spawn object in the
      database.
  returns: Returns a time_t value representing the Unix timestamp when the spawn will
    respawn, or 0 if no respawn information is available for that particular spawn.
  examples:
  - title: Basic usage example
    code: "time_t respawnTime = map->GetRespawnTime(SpawnObjectType::Creature, 12345);\n\
      if (respawnTime > 0) {\n    std::cout << \"Respawn time: \" << respawnTime <<\
      \ std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  - title: Advanced usage example
    code: "time_t respawnTime = map->GetRespawnTime(SpawnObjectType::GameObject, 67890);\n\
      if (respawnTime > 0) {\n    time_t now = time(nullptr);\n    time_t remaining\
      \ = respawnTime - now;\n    std::cout << \"Remaining time: \" << remaining <<\
      \ \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n}"
    language: cpp
  notes: This method is typically used in conjunction with other map-related methods
    to manage dynamic world content. The method may return 0 if no respawn information
    exists for the given spawn ID, which can happen when spawns are not configured
    or have been removed from the database. Performance considerations include caching
    of respawn times to avoid repeated database queries.
  warnings: This method should be used carefully as it can potentially cause performance
    issues if called frequently without proper caching. Also, ensure that the spawnId
    and type parameters are valid to avoid undefined behavior or crashes.
